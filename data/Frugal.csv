We looked at houses in that range, gorgeous half acre, sprawling lawns, magnificent kitchens with stainless appliances. We also thought about the monthly mortgage, property taxes, upkeep, utilities, etc.

In the end, we find a nice smaller home with everything we *needed* (not wanted) for $70,000. My realtor said he had never seen anyone go for a house that was 1/3 of what we were approved for. He said most people either go for the max or even try to haggle a larger approval.

In the end, we have a nice home on a nice block and are so happy here. We went from living in a tiny apartment in the east coast, paying $1200 a month rent, $400 a month utilities, to the Midwest. My monthly mortgage with insurance and property tax is $460. Utilities are under $150. We have been able to pay off a huge chunk of debt, start a nice savings account. I have also managed to fix everything in the house on my own so far, thanks to research online, saving me big bucks in maintenance. For example, the chest freezer stopped working, after a few hours of research, determined what part was needed, $13 later, it works fine vs. calling someone down for a minimum of $100.

We are by no means less happy in the smaller home. It feels great to not worry about 3,000 sq feet to cool and heat, and thousands of square feet of lawn to cut.

I could come on here and post every little thing I save money on, but that doesn't help out anyone.

I subscribed to /r/frugal, to read up on advice, to help with my transition into independent adulthood. And it has helped me immensely, but ever since it has become a popular subreddit, quite frankly it has become a shitty circle jerk. Hell /r/frugal_jerk has started linking directly here and it's hilarious, which is bad for this sub.

I didn't subscribe to see some lady that saved money on makeup because it was on sale. Or see what you picked out of the dumpster. It's awesome that you are able to save money on all these things, and if /r/frugal helped you find it, awesome! But, this isn't a subreddit to post your ""wins"" it's a subreddit to help others ""win"". 


&gt; The purpose of r/frugal is to share what we have each learned. Let's all work together to keep r/frugal on-topic, friendly, honest and helpful.

I realize this post is contradictory, but I think this is something that should be addressed, maybe recommend other subreddits for particular post that don't belong here. Such as /r/dumpsterdiving


In resposnse to /u/Maxcactus, pretty much saying he won't moderate this sub, and he won't add new mods, some users have took to making new subs. Here are a couple.


/r/frugality - the new /u/Maxcactus -less subreddit for frugal ideas

/r/FrugalWins - pictures of coupons, receipts, paid off credit-card bills, etc., and hopefully the accompanying stories (not everyone can learn from these, but I think it's okay for people who want to brag about their frugality).

/r/FrugalBestOf - The best tips, articles, or insights into frugal behavior

/r/CheapAsFuck - for doing things that are the absolute cheapest you can. Basically, all those things that aren't ""frugal"" anymore, and are just plain cheap. Because lets face it, sometimes its necessary to be cheap as fuck.



Some more appropriate subs for your consideration:

/r/ThriftStoreHauls

/r/DumpsterDiving

/r/anticonsumption

Hello to all the frugalites!  After the recent post about [hostility](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/lmbz0/whats_with_the_hostility_in_frugal_lately/) on Frugal, a discussion was sparked with the mods.  We figured now would be a good time to let everyone know how we go about modding this subreddit, and let you all know about a few changes that have been made.  



**What we do:**

* Approve legitimate posts caught in the spam filter.  - If your post isn't showing up, please [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23Frugal) with the link, we will fix it as soon as possible.  
* Remove posts and comments that are obvious spammers and ones that have links to commercial sales sites. - This includes any site selling an item or service, coupon sites, deal sites and sales announcements.


All of the mods here are firm believers in the principles of free speech.  Even though we don't like the sometimes trolling and negativity, we're not going to start removing it.  We could probably count on one hand the amount of times we've had to remove something.


My suggestion to the community, would be to use the downvote on comments &amp; posts like that.  Call people out (Remember it doesn't cost you anything to be nice) and use the power of voting to bring the good stuff to the top.  Additionally, if you guys have any tips on how we can encourage a better subreddit, we would love to hear it!  

Finally, due to encouraging a great discussion here on Frugal, we've added Arntegio to the mod team. Please give them a warm welcome. :D


Hopefully the other mods will chime in and add anything I may have missed. 

**Thanks, and again, please upvote so as many people as possible can see this!**


**Edit:** There's been some talk regarding the links to commercial sales sites.  I would like to take a moment to plug [r/deals](http://www.reddit.com/r/deals).  Take a moment to subscribe, so everyone has a place to find the best prices on whatever you're looking for.

Apparently, frugality is for the financially desperate. It's a means to an end, kind of like an overweight person dieting until they're skinny.

On the rare occasion that a fiscally responsible person does show up, I pay close attention to what they say. Their strategies are often drab, unsexy, and rely on years of consistency, but they're in much better financial shape than most of the people I read about on here.

Disjointed frugality tips and articles about poor spending habits are great for karma. They have little value for a person who wants to see the day that money is not a problem. 

Edit: Lots of interesting points in this thread...

- seems like there's two factions in this sub: those who choose to be frugal and those who have to be. I hail from the former.

- many people who seem well off encounter an attitude of ""You can afford it!"" when it comes to spending habits. In a lot of cases, you get there and retain that position by being frugal.

- frugality is not always monetary. It can be about wasting less, having a quieter lifestyle, ect.

1355322831.0,1846,self.Frugal,14q59v,"I often get called cheap and and get told to ""spend my moldy money"". Here's where I am today...",2747,901,1008,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/14q59v/i_often_get_called_cheap_and_and_get_told_to/,"  6 years ago I got a great opportunity straight out of college. I got an entry level job in my field (Computer Science) starting out at 30k/year. As of today, I still hold that position and nearly doubled my salary in those years. I am still living on my original salary of 30k. 

  When I got my first couple paychecks, I was stupid. Impulse buys, eating out all the time, and just not caring. I was still living at home, so what did I care? $1,800 to a 20 year old with a cell phone bill and student loan is a lot of money. So I bought a computer, spent 400+ every month at the bars, and pretty much wasted my money. 

  After a year of that lifestyle, I moved out on my own and my life drastically changed. I taught myself how to budget my money. I made an excel spreadsheet (which I still have to this day) calculating all my income, expenses, and disposable income I had every month. After a short year, I had budgeting down to a science. This is when I started noticing what I could accomplish. 

  In those short couple of years, I sold a ""racecar"" for a more economical car. As my raises and promotions came in, all the extra income went straight into a savings account. I got braces at the age of 23 (something I wanted for YEARS) and paid for them in cash. I got LASIK and paid for it in cash. That's $10,000. I paid off a student loan at the beginning of the year which was a couple thousand. I also stopped smoking which saved me $160/mo.

  At the beginning of the year, there was nothing else I wanted for myself. Straight teeth and 20/15 vision, I was happy. So I challenged myself to save up what I spent getting myself to where I was without those 'body mods' with my relatively new skill of budgeting. 


  Which brings me to where I am today. 12 short months later, I have 1 student loan left which will be paid off at the end of next year, $10,000 in the bank, no car payment, got engaged, and a great feeling of self discipline. I still live on my original paycheck, and my life style hasn't really changed that much from when I first started budgeting. I still go out on the weekends to the bars, but always find myself at the happy hours that offer 50% drinks/food/whatever.

Moral of the story: Budgeting is an extremely powerful tool when used properly. I know most of you already know this, but I just wanted to share my story and the effects it had on me.

EDIT: Gonna address the most common replies here.

LASIK was $5,000. Lifetime corrections for FREE, which is why the cost upfront was so high.

1371269791.0,1807,self.Frugal,1gdtil,"I eat VERY well for less than $30 per week in a very expensive country (Australia). Here’s how, and AMA!",2799,992,405,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1gdtil/i_eat_very_well_for_less_than_30_per_week_in_a/,"Hi r/frugal! 

I live on my own and eat for one, which is less efficient. But I find that can actually do it very cheaply! I track my finances using a simple but very handy excel spreadsheet that breaks down my spending by category. I keep one spending account, and at the end of the month all I need to do is export my bank statement into excel, and then classify my purchases. So I can honestly promise you that I spend on average about $120 per month on food. If you would like the template for this spreadsheet, send me a PM (edit: Please don't. See below for link). 

Here are my simple rules: 

1.Don’t waste anything, and only buy what you need. 

* It is better to buy little, fresh and often than to have vegetables rotting in the bottom of your fridge and a freezer full of strange packages that you can’t quite remember. Really, you probably don’t live that far from the shops. 

2.Cut your extras by pre-empting your own likely behaviours. 

* It’s easy to avoid buying lunch if you made it the night before and just have to grab it on your way out. It’s easy to cut your junk food, alcohol and sugary drinks intake by NOT BUYING THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. My personal rule is that to eat these things, I need to make a special trip just to get them. Most comfort eating is due to ready availability. This will save you massive, massive amounts of money.
 
3.Learn how to cook. 

* Sorry, but there’s no way around this one. Think of learning to cook as a massive investment - it is a skill that will be invaluable life-long for your happiness, your health, for your family’s health, for your wallet, and for your popularity. I highly recommend [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=249k2WymdFc&amp;list=FLv-5_em9J4-DhPdLuBhTdQA&amp;index=2) series by Gordon Ramsay as a good starting point. But the best way to learn how to cook is to actually cook stuff!

* Cooking is actually very simple – once you pick up the basic set of principles, you’ll find that you can apply them in an infinite variety of culinary situations. How do you know if you can cook? If you can consistently make amazing food without a recipe. 

* If you know how to cook, you don’t sneer at cheap cuts of meat or shy from vegetables that aren’t carrots. And this massively diversifies the list of possible ingredients you can buy. This will play into my most important rule in a big way. 

4.My most important rule - Keep a well-stocked pantry of staples, and then “accessorise” your meals with whatever is cheap, seasonal or on sale. If you know how to cook, this is easy!

* A big part of this is knowing your local merchants, and shopping smart. If you are following rule 1 and buying little and often, typically it doesn’t matter if you’re buying sale vegetables that look a little sad because you’ll be cooking them up that night. 

* Don’t “plan” your meals – eg. “Tuesdays I have chicken” and then go buy chicken, no matter the current market price. 

Here are some examples for what I mean. 

**Staple:** Dry egg and rice noodles, Asian Sauces. 
**Accessories:** Seasonal veg and cheap cuts of meat to make stir-frys and noodle soups. 

**Staple:** Pasta and tinned tomatoes/cream. 
**Accessories:** Whatever vegetables or meats are on sale. Make creamy or tomato pasta as you so desire. 
eg. Mince is cheap? Sphagetti and meatballs. Chicken is cheap? Creamy chicken and pesto pasta. Bacon is cheap? Pasta carbonara. Tomatoes are cheap? Minestrone soup. 

**Staple:** Museli (my breakfast of choice). 
**Accessories:** Seasonal fruits, on-sale yoghurts. 

* Eating this way also means that you’ll find you’re always eating an interesting, varied diet, not repeating the same boring meals over and over! Produce that is in season also tends to be better quality, and full of more vitamins, minerals etc. Shopping is also a very quick, painless process that doesn’t involve too many decisions. On sale? Yep, I’m eating that tonight. 

For my final words of advice - I’m frugal by nature, but I wouldn’t call myself a tight-arse. Here’s my simple philosophy on money that I think more people should espouse. Go right ahead and SPEND MONEY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF YOUR LIFE. That’s what money is for! If you have money, and can use it in such a way that it makes you or others happier, then go right ahead. But why spend money on something that is **not adding value** to your existence?

I took it hard even though I was the one doing the breaking up.  I started hanging out at my brothers in the evenings after work to cope.  I would take my dog over to his house to play with his roommates dog.  

He started cooking dinner a few times a week and we would all end up eating dinner together.  Before we knew it there were 5 of us that were cooking and eating together 5-6 nights a week.  

Its been over a year now and still going strong, lost one of the girls to a break up but there are 4 of us.  We have a small garden in the backyard and chickens to keep us in eggs.  We take turns buying groceries and shopping.  

I haven't done the math as to how much I am saving compared to before we started doing this.  But I end up shopping once a month for the group.  I spent 100 last month and 200 this month.  So I chipped in 300 dollars for 2 months of home cooked dinners.  

It is really difficult to cook for two people, and even worse for one.  4-5 is a good number.  We rarely have leftovers and if we do someone will pack them for their lunch.  We cook so much that food doesn't go bad and we eat a lot more fresh veggies, the garden helps with that too.  Also the chores get split up as well, the cooking the cleaning the shopping all gets split up among the group so that no-one is over worked.

So I joke and say that it is our hippie commune and we call ourselves the Cornbread Mafia.  

Does anybody else have a situation like this? Or any experience with an actual hippie commune?  Like, are we going down a slippery slope into becoming full blown hippies?

Edit: Thanks for all the support and kind words.  I didn't know this would blow up like it did!

I've seen the same type of post every day on /r/frugal with the same answers: Foodbank, lentils, rice in bulk etc. People aren't searching for their problem before they ask, and to be completely honest these posts aren't really about frugality but emergency situations. 

To meet in the middle, can we compile a ""survival"" guide instead? 


EDIT: I would love to create another subreddit along the lines of /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, but on a larger scale.
Someone suggested that /r/Assistance  exists, which might be a good place to direct people.

 It's not that I don't care about people in crisis, it's just that there are too many of the same posts with the same answers. Reddit is a place to find new, innovative and interesting information. Additionally, maybe /r/frugal just isn't the place for emergency advice if it's getting to the point where there are five posts a day near the top on this subject. 

In fact, that seems like enough material for another small subreddit which could attract a lot of people in need and be more focused on a goal of charity and helping others. 

EDIT 2: There is a very distinct difference between not wanting to help people, or not understanding that shit happens and finding a better, more efficient and helpful place to post things and get advice. 

EDIT 3:
(Take from comments) 
REPLY FROM THE MODERATOR: Just in the last week we added over 3000 new members. After moderating /r/frugal for close to 5 years I have arrived at the conclusion that repeated posts are a fact of nature. I have had sidebars filled with what the OP prescribes. Put in lots of time creating a wiki that contains the answers to FAQ. Posted replies that contained hundreds of search results for the repeated question. The end result is that people do not read the sidebar and wiki.
Frugal is what the members make of it so post good content and use your votes to make it a better subreddit. If you don't like a post subject just move along till you see one that is relevant to you.

(Think of this what you will, I feel like more could be done.)

1. Will, last updated in 2001, right after 9/11 (written before grandkids, who are more awesome than brother and I). Dad is getting this updated.
2. Power of Attorney. Dad was upset he didn't know this was important, and wants to do this right away. He's getting this done with an updated will. He also said ""3lazycats, oh hell, I don't even know where your mother is keeping all of our money.""
3. Health Care decisions. Dad wants to be shot in the backyard like a dog if he ever gets really sick, Mom wants every possible intervention.  They have a lot of talking to do about this.
4. Death. Burial, Last wishes and all of that.

Thankfully, his doctor (or whoever does the insurance coding in the office, more likely) is amazing. They use a shared lab in the same building so they are able to bill all lab work under a single visit; so, hundreds of dollars in lab work becomes a $30.00 copay.  However, they do not do any radiology, save for basic x-rays. So when he needed a CT scan with and without contrast, they scheduled it at the city hospital's radiology lab. 

The lab called to confirm the scan the day before. They also dropped this. ""It'll be $1350.00 **after** insurance. Will you be bringing payment in full?""  

This was so totally out of our realm  of affordability as to be laughable. I knew there had to be something else. So I logged on to the insurance company's site and found their price comparison tool. It allows you to search by a specific procedure or test and aggregates what patients have paid for various services after coverage. So I dialed up providers in our city for CT scans. There were three. There was the hospital, average price was $1300.00 - $1600.00. One was closed. The third brought a tear to my eye. 

It was a medical imaging office. All they do is MRI, CT, X-ray, ultrasound, etc. They offer the EXACT same scan for $350.00 after insurance and happily scheduled him for the same time as the old appointment. 

We were in-and-out in 30 minutes and saved about $1000.00. 

tl;dr - Medical pricing is totally arbitrary. Shop around and save.

**Update:** 
Thanks for the kind wishes everyone. The results indicate that a benign cyst has grown on his brain and is causing his symptoms. They've also discovered (from other diagnostic work) that his heart is beating very irregularly. At this point we're looking at pain management and monitoring the cyst. He is going to wear a heart monitor for a few days to get a clearer picture of his cardiac health.  If the cyst grows than we're looking at surgery. His heart may need a pace maker. Whatever happens, I will be calling BC/BS and working with them to find the most affordable hospital. 

I've loved the many great discussions and commentary from you all,  reading them has been fascinating! I didn't think this post would get much attention, I was just letting out some of my frustration with all this. I hope it helps some of you. I **don't** think the people who work in health care have any malice; quite the opposite. It is the system they work in and medical administration that creates many of the issues we're facing. That being said, don't be bullied by the system. You're in control of your care.

I am moving from making ~15K a year to making 60K+ a year, starting in a month. Know how I am celebrating? Paying off all my debts as soon as I can, renting a cheap place in a not-so-fancy part of the town I am moving to, and NOT buying a new car. It feels great to get my first big-boy job out of college, and people are pressuring me to get a cool place or get a new car. The life I have right now has worked for the past few years, there isn't anything that needs to change! Extra income is going towards savings and debt, not towards shiney new toys.

Just have to express how happy I am about my new lease with you all. It is definitely more expensive than living with 6 people than I am right now, but it's nowhere close to a ritzy 1-person apartment at a complex or a loft in the ""young, hip"" part of town. I see so many young people blow their newly earned income on living an extravagent lifestyle.

1348580554.0,1377,self.Frugal,10g637,A list of tips for a college kid or someone who's struck out on their own,1890,513,435,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/10g637/a_list_of_tips_for_a_college_kid_or_someone_whos/,"- Shop around. Don't always assume Walmart is the cheapest. For my area, Aldi's is good for basic produce and frozen goods. Try new places, and don't be afraid of Dollar Stores. Speaking of...

- Know what you want. I use Dollar Stores to buy hair ties/brushes, cards, party favors, and knick knacks. Some can really rip you off, but my local Dollar Tree is well-stocked, clean, and friendly.

- Don't be afraid of Ethnic Stores. When I lived in Birmingham, Al, I loved to shop at a place called Super Oriental Market. They had really cheap Asian sauces, spices, and such. Same goes for Mexican or Indian shops, you can get some great ingredients cheaply. Of course, you want to make sure everything is clean and what not. 

- Prioritize. Do you really need a tiny tub of ice cream that's $5? Probably not. Make a basic grocery list. Here's mine! (Chicken legs, fish, fresh fruit/veg, frozen veg [4], cheese, eggs, milk, bread, canned goods [4], boxed potatoes) Then, my husband and I pick our special item. For him, it's usually crackers. I like mac&amp;cheese. That's a very basic list. I'll add potatoes or cabbage or onions if needed. But, from that, I can provide for my husband and I for two weeks easily. Three, if I really have to.

- LEARN TO COOK. I cannot stress that enough! You'll save so much by not eating out every week. Save some money so you can eat out once or twice a month, but no more. If you stock up your pantry right, you can eat for pennies a meal.

- Balance dinner. Dinner is where things, for me, got out of control. I didn't know how to cook, so I was making Hamburger Helpers. I spent money on the meal box and meat for a disappointing dinner we scarfed down completely. No leftovers. What a waste. Now, I buy chicken drumsticks (the cheapest cut where I lived), starch sides, and plenty of veggies. It might seem for expensive upfront, but it will hold you for a while as long as you practice...

- Portion Control. Seems obvious, right? Well, other then it being healthy, it's frugal. I like to have boxed mashed potatoes with dinner. Now, each box is separated into two bags. Those bags hold four servings. Since it's just my husband and me, that's perfect for dinner and next day. If it's just you, you might have to play around with the measuring cups. Portion control helps food go much, much farther. It might seem small, but put next to steamed veggies and a meat, it's a complete meal. Oh, and if you are planning to pack up your dinner for later, do it before you eat, otherwise you might accidentally eat it.

- Buy in season. When lettuce is in season, I can get it for $0.20-0.30 a head. Out of season, it's a dollar. That might not seem like that big of a difference, but it's up to 5x more for tiny little heads. That's just a quick example. Fruits and veggies can get pretty expensive if you're not careful.

- Save left over veggies in a large zip bag in your freezer. Keep at it until you've got a good amount, then you can add tomato soup and chicken for a quick soup or use them in a casserole for a ""free"" meal.

- Worst comes to worst. Your pantry and fridge is empty, and payday is days away. Mom and dad are off in Hawaii and your friends have mysteriously disappeared... Well, the human body is an amazing machine, and it wants to keep functioning. Potatoes, cabbage, and milk will hold you over for a few days. I seriously don't recommend this. It sucks hards. But, my husband and I were forced to for a week and we lived. But, if you are careful, it should never come to that.

- Try to buy generic brands. To be fair, I don't always. See, I love Progresso's Clam Chowder. Lovelovelove! I haven't found a canned variety that I like as much. But cola? I can't taste the difference. When I do buy it, I get a generic brand that $0.64 a liter. I also use generic soaps and shampoos. For me, generic ""looks-like-Head&amp;Shoulders"" works fine. Of course, if you have sensitive skin or scalp, by all means, get what you need. If you need a particular kind of soap, try calling the manufacturer. They're usually more then happy to give slight discounts to repeat customers. My mom gets all sorts of samples for her flare ups that way.

- You don't need every cleaner under the sun. Seriously. You don't. I use a bleach solution in a (marked) squirt bottle. For mopping, same thing. For dishes, I splurge and buy Dawn. I like the animals on it. After that, a carpet/hardwood floor cleaner (which ever you have).

- Salvation Army is your new best friend. You can hit major gold if you're willing to look. I found my dress heels for $2, and my all purpose black dress for $3. 

- Budget. A good, basic one to follow is 50, 30, 20. 50% for essentials (Rent, bills, gas, food), 30% for wants (games, eating out), 20% for saving. Depending on what you make, you may need to modify it slightly, but it's a good model to follow.

- Save for you time. Budget a few bucks for a new game, or a manicure, or whatever. I buy yarn to knit with or some books. Don't try to budget this away. I mean, if you need gas, then fine, but you're important, too. 

- Carry cash for shopping trips. It's too easy to go over ""just ten extra dollars!"" with a card. That extra money has to come from somewhere. If you're not careful, if might come out of your bills.

- If possible, save for a bike. I don't have one, in all fairness. I don't live near any where. However, it can be a great investment if everything's tucked in tight around you.

- Roll your budgets over. I had $30 left of from my bills budget because my power and water bill lowered! Score! Free dinner? No. That went towards next months needs as a safety net. You never know when your bills will rise, or you need extra gas. Sometimes, I roll over my ""me"" money. I usually plan for about $30, but I'll hold it for a month if I want something more expensive, like a newly released video game, or a small shopping trip, or I want to visit the Aquarium. My husband and I combined our allowances for two months to buy a yearly pass. Now, we get in for free! :)

- You will mess up. It's gunna happen. No amount of tips in the world can help you if you don't help yourself. So, put on your big boy boots and push through the hard times. It's gunna take some getting used to if you've never budgeted before. I used to think I was great with money until I moved out. I was buying stuff left and right like my parents seemed to, only... well, they were working full time salaried cushy jobs. Me? $2.15/hr as a hostess. Did. Not. Work. Out. Some people are naturally frugal, I proved that I wasn't.

1376404149.0,1330,self.Frugal,1ka232,How we made our cell phone bill go from $160 to $25,1871,541,518,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1ka232/how_we_made_our_cell_phone_bill_go_from_160_to_25/,"This sub has been really helpful so I wanted to share our recent success.  I spent many, many hours over the last few weeks looking into ways to trim the glaring $160 cell phone bill in our budget.  MVNO's are tricky, some good, some bad, and so it wasn't easy.  However, I came to two conclusions:  There are distinct ""best"" MVNO's for the two major usage patterns little to medium as one, and a ""crap ton"" for the other.  If you are a little to medium user, read on! 

**The secret to your happiness is Ting.com and Google voice.** Ting operates on the sprint network, and offer the best prices and price structure of any MVNO I could find.  

Here are their rates: https://ting.com/rates
Here is their savings calculator: https://ting.com/calculator

They are unique in that you have no contract, and only pay for what you use.  For example, in their great web interface, when you log in you see how many minutes you've used and which bucket you fall in.  On their site they have a savings calculator if you are interested.  

So here are the steps: 

1. Order a new phone from Ting at full price
2. Get the phone activated in about 3 minutes from home
3. Sign on to google voice, and spend $20 to port your old number to google voice. (The purpose of this is to get free text messaging, essentially eliminating that bucket from Ting.)
4. Profit. 

Our bill this month was $21 because we were around Wi-Fi a ton, and with google voice ringing out home phone we were able to stay in the S bucket for each category.  Keep in mind, that we actually talked closer to 1000 minutes, just used VoIP (Talkatone on a smart phone, but thats another post), texted over 1000 messages, and used near 2 gb of data.  

All in all, this is obviously slightly more ""work"" than just enjoying our verizon iphones, but I've been surprised how easy this work has come. 

Finally, if you want to give it a try here is a link to get $25 off a phone if you buy new, or $25 towards your service if you buy a refurbished phone.  I used a link similar to this to sign up so our first month's service was free!  (Full disclosure, I believe I also get some sort of credit, $25, if you use this, but dont have much experience with it. So if you purchase through this link, an advanced thank you! If not then no worries, and hopefully you enjoy the new phone service!)

**$25 off link** - https://z55r5k1roq3.ting.com/

Biggest win of Ting: My concern was, ""I've heard sprint sucks though?""  Well, so far I haven't not had sprint signal where I live, but the good news is that Ting is one of the few MVNO's that voice roams for free to Verizon.  So you get the prices of Sprint, with the great network of Verizon.

Edit: If you have any questions about the quality of the service let me know! 

Edit 2: They haven't come up yet, but we did actually pay early termination fees for leaving Verizon.  The rough numbers for us are that we will break even in 4-5 months, and then profit, for a total savings of $1200 over a typical 2 year contract.  

**Edit 3:** I can't believe I forgot to mention this earlier.  Their web interface is unique in that you can easily set up alerts for all three buckets for the account, or per line.  You can have them send you an e-mail when you reach any minute, text or data count.  Most importantly, you can set it to just turn off when it reaches a certain point.  If you don't want to go above 1000 Mb, you can set data to turn off automatically at that point.  This is amazing, and I bet extremely handy for families with teenagers.  

**Edit 4:** Thank you to everyone for the kind comments!  It is always humorous when one comment says ""This is amazing, thank you!"" and the next accuses me of being a company shill. So to address a few of the concerns: No, I do not work for Ting.  I have been on reddit for near a year and have an active history of submitting and contributing to many sub-reddits related to my actual field.  I updated the link info above when I learned the amount of the credit I would receive, and included a disclaimer in the beginning.  The way their system is set up referrals benefit both parties!  I did not intend to deceive, and attempted to make it clear how it worked!  

***Final Update and Summary:*** 
So, after hive minding with the over 400 comments it seems that the way it goes is this: 

1) If you medium to light user, like I addressed in my OP, then TING with or without google voice is your best bet. 

2) If you are a heavy user then the reddit community supports Republic wireless ($19 unlimited everything, primarily through integrated VoIP), Virgin Mobile ($35 for 300 mins, and unlimited data and text) or T mobile prepaid ($30 for 100 mins, and unlimited data and text.)  Each of these has their pros and cons.  For us, while these are great deals for unlimited, are usage was such that we can save more with Ting.  However, it seems the breaking point is the 2-3 Gb of data usage between Ting and benefiting from an unlimited plan!

Hope this helped more than a few of you!

- Bought his used truck in 1999; and still drives it today. He's learned to maintain it and keep it in pristine condition over the years. Everything from an oil change to a tire change (Edit: Meant rotating) is done in his Garage. His investment in tools has paid off over the years by doing family and friend jobs for cheap.
- Bought his wife's car used in 2002. She still drives it today as well. 

Eating Out:
- He eats out once a week; and considers $30-$40 a huge deal.
- Only drinks beer on his night out. The only day of the week he does.

Houses:
- He still lives in the first house he ever purchased. He made a large down payment on it and then paid off more than the monthly minimum until it was paid for.
- As a side job he started flipping houses. At first he paid for them; and as time went on he funded the houses while letting others work on  them.
-His exact words regarding house payments: ""The shorter time you have one, the better off you'll be.""
-He pays for his houses by taking out a home equity loan on the one he lives in. 

Investments:
- Mutual funds: His reasoning is that he doesn't have to or want to spend the time learning and watching stocks daily. He'll let the professionals do it for him. 

Television:
-His TV is from 2002 or so. His reasoning for never upgrading is why? I can still see it from my chair and I understand everything I'm seeing. Nothing looks bad and I haven't had any problems with it.

If this catches on a bit; I'll write some more of what he's said. I don't want to waste my time spreading some of his knowledge if it lacks interest.

Edit with more of things he does and some background on him and his wife:
He's been an AC repairman until retiring; she's a former executive at a larger corporation. Both worked their way up in their respective jobs. He had no college degree; she went to night school while working at the office during the day for years. Both retired around age 52. 

Hobbies:
- They both still do spend some money on their hobbies; over the years he's collected guns. He used to have a boat (that was too expensive for him to upkeep). He bought a 1999 motorcycle in 2002 or 2003 and still has it in pristine condition. My Uncle enjoys fishing; and as of recently has taken up exercising and reading. She likes to walk and exercise as well. Also has taken up reading with him. They both got their first library cards a few months ago.

Attitude:
- He enjoys his life. My aunt and uncle have never been into anything all too fancy and enjoy the easy things in life. They're comfortable with their lives and are fine with how they live. They don't have any desire to get any crazy luxuries because they didn't grow up wanting or needing them. Why start now?

Gas:
- Around here there's a grocery store that gives gas points based upon money spent. 2x points (and occasionally 4x points) per dollar spent. Every 2000 points can be used to take $2.00 off a gallon of gas, up to $35 gallons. If they ever need to do something (or are going somewhere) my uncle will purchase a gift card from there first. So for their night out every week; he'll buy a $30 gift card to the restaurant, or before he purchases something for the houses he's flipping my uncle will but a $500 gift card to Lowes or Home Depot. Money he'd spend anyway; but still benefits from it. Gas that was $3.50 a gallon, after the points off, becomes $1.50 a gallon. ($3.50x35 = 122.50 after money off $1.5x35=$52.50). Saving money he wouldn't have otherwise.

Vacationing:
- They tend to use others homes they know. Her family has houses in places like Michigan and Florida. Why pay a hotel when you can stay in a family place for free? 

Edit #2:
401K/Pension:
- After having paid into these plans for years; on top of having no house payment; no car payments; and no debts; my uncle estimates they live on around $40,000 a year. This amount is lower than what the payout will be on their retirement plans; meaning that they won't have to touch their savings or investments until medical bills pile up or something absurd and completely out of the ordinary occurs. 

Retirement:
- He's been reading up on the cost of retirement and figures this is where most of his money will end up going. With medical bills, inflation, and any other issues he feels that with his current lifestyle he'd never really have to work another day. The money he's got put away might seem like a lot, but he's seeing it as lasting him another 30-40 years down the road.

Edit #3:
Banks:
- Banks are more willing to cater to you; the more money you have vested in them. My uncle didn't like the interest rate he was getting at one. He went in and asked for them to raise it a bit higher because of the size of his investment (around $250,000) and the teller said she couldn't do that. He asked her to write him a check for the amount and he left. Received a call the next day asking him to come and talk with the branch manager. The manager told him he'd give him the interest rate he asked for; and then for his trouble and a bit more for the trouble he was caused by the teller. (It was a change from 1.9% to 2.1% and I believe the teller lost her job because she'd almost lost them a heavily invested client).
- Also (tip of his for the very wealthy already) don't put all of your money into one bank. Spread it between various ones as each account can only be secure for up to x amount (I think $100,000 or so is what the FDIC covers).

About a week or two into January I started packing my own lunch and not going out to eat for dinner every day, and February has been the first full month where I didn't go out to eat every day.  Doing this has saved me $1,130.38 compared to last month which is crazy!!!  I've also been cutting other expenses and have been much more thoughtful about how I spend my money.  

The crazy thing is that this has somehow made me less lazy and I seem to have more time for getting other things done.  The relationship I have with my dogs has improved tremendously as I have more time an energy to take them for longer walks and give them more attention.  

I'm really glad I started living frugally now.  I just received some year end bonus money and a raise but have *no* intentions of changing my lifestyle.  

Thanks frugal, just being here inspires me to be better :)

***Edit: My post isn't very clear and has seemed to have caused some major confusion.  I saved $1130.38 on my overall spending compared to last month.  This wasn't all food savings, but a big chunk of it was. Thanks for voting me to the top of r/frugal, what an honor!

I wrote a ~20 page document for him, outlining some plans for his goal of becoming debt-free. Because it's my brother and I know him, I tried to make it as easy-to-read and entertaining as possible.

He called me the day he got it in the mail and said, ""Oh my god, that was awesome! That was the funniest thing I've ever read. I'm going out tonight, and now I feel a little guilty. But I only have to save up $100 for the rest of this month, right?""

It was the first time he'd actually really talked about saving money, hah! My mom called me the next day and said she had started reading it, and was halfway through and cracking up.

I doubt he'll follow the aggressive scenario, but I'm sure he won't just default to the base scenario, which is fine with me.

Just wanted to share!

EDIT: So this is getting crazy!  Thanks for all the kudos you happy lovers!

Should I start a website doing this for people?  Apparently this is $2000 worth of information.  The problem is, the people who actually need this will not be able to pay much.

But, I don't see recipes with cous cous often, and surprisingly so given the reasonable price and ultra-fast cook time of it.  Many people here don't know how to cook much, but you can make something pretty damn awesome w/ almost no cooking knowledge here.

$4 - 1lb sausage - I like the long rope italianish ones (Google Premio for an example)
$2 - 1lb brocolli crowns  
$2 - 1 10oz box of plain Cous Cous (such as Near East brand)
$2 - Miscellaneous cost:  olive oil, garlic, parmesan cheese, black pepper, spinach, red pepper flakes, chicken boullion, basil, onion

In a pan or grill pan, spread out the sausage and start cooking it over medium-low heat.  When it is brown on one side, flip it over, and cook 'til it's done throughout.  If you like onions, while this is cooking, slice an onion into 1/8"" thick rings and toss in the pan.  Stir them around occasionally so they don't burn.

While that's happening, chop up your brocolli and toss it in a pot w/ some hot water and boil until this is al dente.  Drain the water, and toss with some cold water to stop it from continuing to cook.

Put the pot back on a medium range and pour 3-4T of dark olive oil into it (the darker the better).  When that's warm, put a tablespoon or two of finely chopped (or pureed, even better) garlic and some red chili flakes into the oil and stir those until the garlic gets nice and fragrant and the water (if you use canned) has sizzled off.  Not enough to darken it, but enough to get rid of the strong pungent overtones.

Add 2c of water to the pot, turn the heat to high, and bring it to a boil.  Add 1-2 tablespoons of chicken boullion, some dried basil and black pepper, stir in, and dump in the box of cous cous.  Turn off the heat, stir this together, and cover the pot tightly.

While the cous cous cooks (5 minutes), chop the sausage.  When it's done, stir it up to get it nice and grainy again.  Add 1/2c of parmesan cheese, the brocolli, onions and sausage.  Add some spinach if you want...I put in about 2-3oz of chopped frozen spinach.  It's a cheap non-obnoxious way to add more veggies to my diet.  Stir together, let it cool for a few minutes, and portion out.

Reasonable protein, good level of veggies, smells awesome when you heat it back up (decent cold as well).  If you want to use more veggies, you can give the water more time to boil, and mix in finely sliced celery or carrots, etc, and add the cous cous when they're tender.  Fresh tomatoes added after cooking are good of course.

This makes 5-6 hearty portions.

Edit:  I'm sorry if there's no lentils, or if it doesn't have the exact number of calories you find is useful, or if I am way under on the cost (even though the one person who tried buying these found it cost them less), or if it's not a mashed potato and miracle whip sandwich, or if you didn't know to make a candle out of a can of tuna in oil, or if it's sausage, or if it's not a meal-replacement shake or if you don't like eating the same thing every day.

1358346300.0,1100,self.Frugal,16ooh0,So some of you were curious about my washing machine in some recent threads... here's a cost update of owning versus using a laundrette (in the UK),1636,536,2871,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/16ooh0/so_some_of_you_were_curious_about_my_washing/,"A lot of people were surprised that I had a washing machine in my flat when I posted a photo of my kitchen, I think it's quite normal for Americans to have to go to a laundry facility.

I'm kind of getting fed up with blankets and bedsheets taking ages to dry, so I just popped into my local laundrette to see how much it is to use their dryers. I thought it would be perhaps £1 or so.

I nearly fell over.

Depending on the size of the machine you use, you pay between £3.00 and £4.50 for one wash, and the dryer costs £1 per 15 minutes.

So, using the smallest washer + half an hour in the dryer = £5.00 ($8), using the largest washer + an hour in the dryer = £8.50 ($13.58).

And I don't even live in the most central part of London. I live in zone 3.

Imagine having a family and each wash load costing over $13? And the sad fact is that it's often people who are on the poverty line who don't have facilities in their own flats and have to use laundrettes. 

In comparison, you can buy a washing machine for £100 secondhand (or £400 new) and a typical machine wash will use around £0.50 in electricity (plus water costs). 

London, you have disappointed me today. 

What do you pay to wash/dry in the States? 

EDIT: hey, thanks for all of your replies! It seems like the prices vary drastically and *most* Americans have appliances in a separate room of their house, which is why people were surprised to see it in my kitchen. We have much less land than you!! Our houses are small :)

1. Take the ""Pay yourself first"" ideology, and set a hard savings cap for myself.  I.e., save X no matter what, and survive off of only Income - X

2. Don't be cheap:  Buying a higher quality item that I know I'm going to use for years has saved me more money over time than buying several cheap items after they break.

3.  Avoid memberships like Sams Club and Costco.  Yes, things are cheaper PER UNIT at wholesale places, but unless you really need 4 bottles of relish, or have a large family depending on you, you don't save enough on non-perishables to make up for the yearly membership (**this one is subjective guys**).  EDIT:  If you have a family member with a membership, select a day of the week to borrow it and get the benefits of the membership without the annual fee, or offer to split it with them.  That way, you can get non-perishables and things that you can freeze, and help them out a little too!

4.  Do activities that are either a. free or b. already paid for.  Example:  I have a large board game and card game collection, and have played them once a week with a group of friends for over 2 years now.  50 dollars for a board game may seem expensive, but they have a replayability that will far outlast most video games, and it's social!  

5.  Thrift Stores. Get over any pride you have concerning thrift stores, and get shopping.  I have a very nice recliner that came out of a failed interior design store down the street.  Cost me $60 and is brand new.

6.  Track your spending.  While this seems obvious, it can actually be hard to do.  Know where your money goes, and how much of it goes to each category.

7.  Check your local subreddit at least once a week.  This has helped me out a lot.  I can often find local people willing to sell things cheaply, or free/cheap local events like 5 dollar movie nights, a free local concert etc.  It helps you meet people, and saves you money while entertaining you.

8.  Wait 1 week before buying something you think you need, unless you REALLY need it. I love to impulse shop, as do most people.  If I wait a week to buy it, I usually don't end up buying it.

9.  Timers on ""vampire"" outlets.  Electronics that are ""passive"" users cost you a lot of money in a year.  For less than $10 on amazon, you can get a timer that will shut off all items connected to that outlet and turn them back on when you specify.

10.  Give yourself a hard impulse cap.  Everyone likes to buy stuff, so trying to go cold turkey doesn't often work.  Instead, what I recommend is giving yourself a small dollar amount as ""free spending money"" that is 1. guilt free and 2. helping you save.  Say you have 20 a month to buy w/e you want.   Now you have to decide what you want most, or how many months you have to wait to get it.  You reward yourself for your willpower.

11.  Have a frugal partner.  This one is tricky, and I got lucky because my wife is even more frugal than I am.  It's very difficult to be frugal when your partner isn't, and you can help each other be frugal.

12.  Use your credit card for as many purchases as possible.  Many credit cards offer a points reward or cash back incentive.  So at the same time as building credit, you get cash back.  I recommend putting as many of your expenses as possible on a rewards credit card that you pay off every month, which will both earn you rewards and build credit!  EDIT: Make sure to pay off the balance every month, and you wont have to pay interest ever!

13.   Coupons!  Get those scissors out folks.  Coupons save a lot of money over a year, and as long as you use them on stuff you actually need, you're not wasting money.  It's even easier with coupon apps.

14.  Coupons 2.0.  Have a junk email to sign up for promotional deals with.  Example: If you know you like icecream, sign up for a baskin robins membership using a crap email and get coupons once a week for it.  You may not use them every week, but when you do, you're saving money.

15.  Grocery store membership cards.  They're free, you can use your junk email to sign up for them, and if you're like me and avoid Sams Club or Costco, you buy groceries often at local places.  My wife and I probably have 6 diferent little membership cards, and over a year or two, they actually add up.  Smith's savings membership is one of my favorites.

16.  Craigslist.  Seriously, there is so much FREE and/or cheap shit out there, you should take 5 mins to check it once a day.

17.  Fresh is cheaper than canned.  People don't seem to understand this often, and get canned food because it's ""cheap"".  The cost of packaging was not only transferred to the price of the item, but they aren't as fresh either!  Buy a batch of fresh cilantro will cost you so much less than buying it dehydrated in a bottle.  And if you don't use it all, chop it, dry it, and bottle it.  problem solved.

18.  Have frugal friends.  If your close group of friends are people who like doing free and/or nearly free or already paid for stuff, then it's much MUCH easier to save money.  If your friends are like ""Hey bro, lets go to the club"" 5 nights a week, you're going to have a very expensive social life.

19. Track your savings.  Earlier I said track your spending, but it helps to track your savings as well!  It gives you a warm fuzzy feeling to see how much money you've saved through living frugally and yes...sacrificing some things.  It'll help keep your willpower strong, and who knows...maybe you can afford that trip to LA this summer after all.

20.  Personal finance phone apps.  When you're out for a night on the town it's hard to keep track of what you're spending, particularly if alcohol is involved.  Well, everyone takes their phone with them right?  Apps such as Toshl help you keep track of your expenditures IN REAL TIME.  No going home and whipping out the 8 receips you've spent that day only to find out you've overshot your budget by $20.  Toshl will alert you when you're approaching your pre-set limit, and won't let you surpass it in the math.  That's when you know to skip dessert or say no to that last beer.

21.  I'm going to end it here because I have to go to work, but I think this is a really important one.  GET A GYM MEMBERSHIP.  But wait chess, gym memberships are expensive!! Even if I get a 2 year membership it's going to be at least $15 a month! That's absurd!  Gym memberships ARE expensive, but for $15 a month you can 1. go as often as you like 2. Look better 3. Feel better 4. Be healthier 5. Be happier 6. Meet people.  The benefits are enormous, and I honestly believe being HEALTHIER and HAPPIER will save you a lot of money in the later years of your life (although there is no guarantee).  Not to mention you'll feel better every day.

22.  (Contributed by odd84).  MAKE MORE MONEY.  Now, I know not everyone can. I know some people work 3 jobs. I know some people are physically disabled or sick or are stuck out in the middle of nowhere with no prospects. But MOST people are healthy and working a single job. MOST people also put forth little to no effort to get raises, to move up in their company, to make lateral moves into departments with more upward mobility, to be on the look out for other employment opportunities in the area where they would be paid more, etc.
There are a great many jobs where simply switching employers every few years would yield a much higher wage increase than a below-inflation annual raise would ever add up to in their current job. There are a great many people who could make a move from a low-skill profession where there are 10 candidates for every opening, to something specialized and in-demand, just by taking a few months of night or weekend classes.
You might also have the opportunity to fix up and rent out a room in your home. To turn a hobby into a side business with eBay/etsy/your own online store. To take hard-earned professional experience and turn it into a consulting business of your own. Heck, if you've saved up a little nest egg, to even consider opening a store of your own instead of working for someone else.  It's a lot easier to live below your means, IF YOU HAVE MORE MEANS!

1337095469.0,994,self.Frugal,tob1g,A list of things I have learned from R/Frugal,1319,325,446,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/tob1g/a_list_of_things_i_have_learned_from_rfrugal/,"First time posting here, although I've been reading this subreddit for some time now. Because my work is tied to a university, I have a (forced) month off. My wife and I are buying a house, so I have been taking stock of our current practices and planning future frugal ideas.
Here are some of the tips and plans for saving money that I have gathered from this subreddit:

**–Cook good and healthy food for less:**
Fruggit has been wonderful in promoting this. Crock-pots/Slow-cookers are your friend. So are dried beans, good quality bulk rice, and many other frugal options. I've found http://budgetbytes.blogspot.ca/ to be very helpful. I've also found that one of the grocery store around me (in a much lower income area) stocks roughly the same items as the other stores, but never sells some of the nicer items. (organic items, good cheeses, etc) When they get close to the end of the shelf life, the store discounts then by 50% to get them off the shelves. Because of this I've adjusted my purchasing schedule to shop there 1-2 times a week, buying fresh fruits/veggies/etc and whatever is dramatically discounted, and then plan meals around this.

**–Get a chest freezer:** 
Gives you the space to take advantage of really cheap food deals, as well as allows you to buy more things in bulk. We will be buying one as soon as we move into our house. (BTW: Lowes always has 10% off coupons in the post office's new address forms. This turns a $200 7 cu. ft. freezer into a $180 one)

**–Get a cheaper cell phone plan:** 
This is a hard one for me. My wife has 22% off at Verizon, and I use my smart phone more often then I use a computer. (which I use ALL the time) With factoring in what the cost of a new high end smartphone would cost, it's still cheaper to get off the Verizon plan, so we likely will switch when our contract is us in 6 months, but it's only a savings of $7-$10 a month. I need to make sure that the coverage and extra features of a pre-paid phone plan are worth it.
However, as a rule pre-paid plans have always been cheaper. I had one for 2 years before I got a contract phone. (needed reception at school, Verizon has the only tower)

**–Make your own laundry detergent:** 
It only took me about an hour to make a powdered detergent from Borax, Washing Soda, and Bar Soap. (1 cup, 1 cup and ½ bar respectively) 
There are tons of recopies. [This is the one I used](http://www.diynatural.com/homemade-laundry-detergent-soap/) Rough cost estimates for me were 900 loads for ~$20. Cheapest equivalent was Aldi's detergent at 360 loads for $25.

**– Look for cheaper means of transportation:**
With each of us having jobs, as well as things like grad school, non profit board meetings, and after school tutoring programs it's not yet been practical for us to move down from two vehicles. I have long fantasized about owning a moped/scooter that's under 50cc  so I could get rid of my terrible car (which with some DIY mechanical work I have somehow kept running) and have an insurance/title free vehicle along with a main car. This may never happen, but would provide a significant amount of savings. We also don't have a good means of public transit.

**–Brew your own alcohol: (Well... at least beer and wine...)**
[r/Homebrewing](http://reddit.com/r/homebrewing) is awesome. I've just started testing the waters of brewing with some 1 gallon test batches of apfelwein. (apple wine) Ciders and meads don't usually require boiling, so there is less initial equipment to purchase, but even for making beer, after the ~$150 initial purchase, your batches will run between $20-$40 for 50-60 bottles of beer that's better than from the store. It's not for everyone, but it's a hobby I'm interested in, and will save money in the long run.

**–Start putting into place energy efficient items in your house:**
I've read countless good ideas for this. Here are a few: 
Smart power strip for TV set ups(Saves about $12/yr) 
 CFL bulbs, 
Water saving shower heads (already using so it won't be an adjustment)
Water Saving Toilet systems: Dual Flush Kit (Or even putting a 2-liter filled with water into your tank to reduce water usage. I like having the full/half flush option)


**–Don't pay for cable, and buy a modem instead of renting one:**
I will have to use Comcrap cable services for internet because they are the only thing in the area. I will definitely buy a modem (it will cost about $40) instead of renting one for $5 a month.
Instead of a cable package get a Roku player (~$50-$60 if you look for a cheap model refurbished or on sale, there are plenty of similar items you could get instead) with your choice of Hulu Plus/Netflix/Amazon prime video. 
Assuming Comcast doesn't play the “force you to bundle with a 'basic cable' package of over-the-air channels for a dollar or two more than just internet which you're not allow to buy ala carte” game, I will also buy a HDTV antenna. [r/cordcutters](http://reddit.com/r/cordcutters) is a great place for information. 

**–Restore or build your own furniture:**
I've recently started getting my feet wet in some DIY projects. ([r/DIY](http://reddit.com/r/DIY) is a great as well) I build a headboard for our bed for under $50. A friend gave us a large wooden spool that my wife and I are going to convert into a table/bookshelf combo. With a few tools, and some time you can save hundreds of dollars and have the satisfaction of building things yourself.

**– Exercise outside of a gym:**
Paying for a gym membership in my opinion can be a frugal option if it makes you exercise, (so many benefits from exercising... I need to do it more) but it's very easy and totally free to go for a walk/job/run outside, and from just a monetary perspective it will save you tons of health care money down the road.

–(For those who have a good handle on their spending) **Use a rewards credit card instead of a debit card:**
I fully understand this is not a good idea for some people. I could tell you several of my friends who I would specifically recommend to not use a credit card. However, in my situation, where I have great mutual accountability between me and my wife, the $300 sign-up bonus and the 1-5% cash back on purchases has been a nice source of extra money, and hasn't increased our spending at all.

**– Use Open-office and Google Docs instead of Microsoft Office:**
While some people need the extra features that Microsoft Office provides (Such as Excel... can't really get a comparable substitute), it amazes me that many people I know do not take advantage of these free and powerful alternatives to a $100 software package.

**– Get your personal finances in order:**
To echo what seems to be the mantra of [r/personalfinance](http://reddit.com/r/personalfinance): Get out of debt, Save up a 6 month emergency fund, max out an employer matched 401K plan, then start investing in indexed mutual funds. Make the money you've saved work for you.
I think Scott Adam's (Dilbert Cartoonist) 9-point plan to personal finance is an easy and clear way that explained the basics tenets of personal finance

Even going back to my college days.

I consider myself pretty easy-going, and also really considerate as far as roommate stuff goes. I don't leave dishes in the sink, I don't play loud music, have pets, smoke, have annoying guests over, etc.

Although I can't afford it, and probably won't be able to anytime soon, I CANNOT WAIT until I can get my own apartment. I'm just so tired of dealing with terrible people who make me not even want to come back to my place of residence at the end of the day. 

It's like I just can't wait to have my own parking spot, my own kitchen, and my own bathroom. I feel like I should be able to afford this, but it still seems like a pipedream. 

Has anyone else ever sacrificed more money per month to live alone and not have to put up with shitty roommates?

**EDITs**

Thanks so much for sharing your insight and stories. It's definitely encouraging to see that I'm not the only one who wouldn't feel guilty about spending some extra $$$ for the peace of mind. I just wish I could at the moment! Currently paying $450/month all-inclusive for a bedroom in a split ranch house, with no common living area. Studio or 1-bedroom places are like $600 and up, and that's before utilities. 

Since everyone is sharing their roommate horror stories, I'll at least fill you in on where I'm coming from:

* In college, I had to share one big room with two other guys. One of them was a WoW-addict who sat around swearing at his screen all day, while the other one was a porn-addict who literally stayed up all night four nights per week to jack off in front of his 24"" monitor. With me trying to sleep just a few feet away.

* My current set-up is such that the people who own the house live on one side, and rent three bedrooms and two bathrooms to people on the other side. I'm one of those people who rents, and have been there the longest at this point. Although the landlords advertise that they are selective in who they pick to live there, they will literally take anyone off the street instead of having a room empty with no rent coming in.

The current people I live with are a 65-year-old lady with medical problems who is a work-from-home psychic of some kind. She once told me that she ""talks to the angels""....very weird. The guy who lived there most of the summer was a 40-year-old going through a nasty divorce and career change at the same time. He would routinely bring his kids over and his new g/f for overnight stays, forcing me to share the tiny kitchen and small bathroom with extra people all the time. The lady that took his place last month is a middle-aged depressed alcoholic who has been homeless most of her life. She has two dogs that she lets bark and run around as well - one of them even ran in my room and shit on my carpet the other day. 

Thankfully I'm moving back to NY in a week (western NY, where living can be plenty affordable).",,False,,t5_2qhbe,1347993678.0,,,True,t3_101z9c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/101z9c/have_you_ever_paid_more_in_rent_for_the/,

TL;DR: Food is WAY more expensive in some parts of the country so you can't always compare apples to apples [pun intended] when talking about average cost to feed a family of X.


Longer Story:

Thanks to couponing, my wife and I have dropped our groceries (including household supplies) down from $900/mo to $500/mo. A decent chunk of our current spending is on produce (30%)! (We are planting a garden for the first time this year to finally help curb those costs).


That being said, I could never figure out how people could get those low grocery bills I hear about on here. Then it hit me while I was on a trip to Michigan (I live in Maryland). The produce there was literally 50-75% cheaper (some extreme examples were even cheaper)! I was completely shocked and blown away by how much less money I would be spending on food if I lived there.


I guess my point is, people jump on here and sometimes condescendingly post about how ""I spend x amount of dollars for a family of x and you should be able to do it too."" Please realize that just because you can buy a box of tomatoes for $5, doesn't mean that I can too! Where you live makes a huge difference in the cost of food. 


Please keep that in mind from now on!


EDIT to add: (2) Adults, (1) 2 year old in the family ... we look at ALL the store ads around and literally buy whatever is on sale at each one to make sure we're getting the lowest pricing on whatever food we're looking at. We also make full actual meals because a 2 year old will not eat rice and chicken every day without having extra to go with it (and I'm not trying to live on a prison-style diet).

EDIT 2: Since indignation01's post is still burried deep, I thought I'd quote it here since it really sums up what my thoughts were pretty nicely:

""
Recommending someone find ways to reduce their grocery bills is very, very different than condescendingly brow beating someone for spending more than what you think a grocery bill ought to be, which is what I've seen most people on here do.

It isn't ""$500 a month on food? Let me see what you're spending that on and perhaps we can get it down to $300.""

It's ""$500 a month on food? There's your problem, pal. I spent 59 cents on food last month. Look at how superior I am. Get real on your food costs and maybe you'll save some money, but stop complaining until you're willing to do that.""

It was really noticeable in the recent thread about the guy who doesn't have a car. 

Frugality is *always* relative. It's a function of getting by with the least expenditure given what you're facing, and adjusting for the quality of life you want. A millionaires concept of frugality will be different than a paupers. 

I drive a car. But before I got my car, I drove a scooter. It was more than sufficient as transportation from A to B and fun, too. I wasn't happy with how safe I was when driving it. I attributed a financial value to that. So I upgraded to a car. No regrets. I bought the cheapest car in the country with the best warranty brand new. I perceive this to be a manifestation of my frugality, but someone else might look at me buying a new car and disagree that ""wasting"" money like that is ever worth it.

There's a difference between being frugal and being a minimalist. To me, being frugal is about stretching your resources to get the things you want in life efficiently. Minimalism is making due with less. Sometimes these things overlap, sometimes they don't.

EDIT: Thanks for sharing your opinions everyone; it's been very interesting reading them. To clarify for some of you who are *whooshing* here: my point is that frugality means different things to different people. There's no single answer. It is a combination of personal taste and personal circumstance. You can spend a lot of money and still be frugal. You can spend very little and be unfrugal. It all boils down to pursuing the things that you value most, that increase your quality of life the most per dollar.",,False,,t5_2qhbe,1349650220.0,,,True,t3_112u1u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/112u1u/frugality_is_always_relative/,

Since this is a commercial free place please do not post blog spam, catalog pages, promotional codes, sales announcements, or attempt to solicit on r/frugal. It does not matter if you do not have a financial interest in these commercial submissions. These posts will be removed.

Coupons, though useful to some people are a type of corporate promotion that is not permitted on r/frugal. Every day businesses issue coupons and make sales announcements to promote their financial interests. R/frugal is not a part of that scheme. For people wanting to participate in this I would suggest [R/coupons](http://www.reddit.com/r/coupons/). A proliferation of coupon posts and their rejection on r/frugal gave rise to that subreddit about 3 years ago. Bottom line, use coupons if you want, just don't post coupons or other sales promotions here.

Here's How I did it: 


**Rent**: I moved out of NYC to a very rural city (13k people). I have a whole house for a little over $400/month. (15% of my gross salary). 


**Energy**: I keep my house at 58-60 degrees all winter.

**Transportation**: I live ½ mile from work so I walk/ride my bicycle. From April-Nov, I use my bicycle 99% of the time to run errands. Being a city (albeit rural), everything is located within 3 miles!  


**Leisure**: Netflix instead of Television, Library (Free), Skyrim (100+ hours) Note: Made a big purchase ($300) for the World’s Largest  Jigsaw Puzzle. I’m 86 hours in while only &lt;10% done. In the long term, it will be a very cost effective hobby.


**Food**: I’m vegan, so mostly dry beans, grains, peanut butter and vegetables (&amp; a little soy milk). I do splurge on organic/whole grains which increases the bottom line


**Unintentional Saving**: No girlfriend (circumstantial [r/foreveralone](http://reddit.com/r/foreveralone) since moving to Appalachia).

On hold for 20 minutes, I finally reach a human. Then get bounced to a second. While talking to her, I learned that there was a minor mixup in the way my account was setup. I voiced my concern that ""when an inconvenience like this happened in the past, your company would offer a promotion 'because I'm such a good customer.' I'd save a few bucks for a few months. That doesn't seem to happen anymore."" I was respectful and non-confrontational, but I wanted satisfaction. We talked about this for about five minutes, she wasn't giving.

I re-worded my displeasure into more of a statement; ""Do you have any promotions you can offer me?"" She immediately looked up something on her computer and added a promotion to my account.

Thank you good guy customer service girl! I felt much better.

Interestingly, she switched subjects and started telling me about how she just graduated college and how, in her major she learned to listen differently to people; to listen *how* people said things, not just what they said. I came to the conclusion that their company's policy currently doesn't let them offer promotions but they're often there for the taking if you ask directly.

I try not to be a dick to people, so I don't usually push to get my way. But I wonder how many more opportunities are not plainly visible, but are there if you listen the right way and ask the right questions?

**Edit:** Ok - I reworded it into a question, thanks for pointing that out. My point is, I was being direct.

Thing is I'm completely broke. There was no way I could afford $75 to see her play, so I applied to volunteer at the festival.  

I got placed in the media tent, and then was assigned to moderate the media scrum with her yesterday. She was every bit as wise and gracious as I always hoped she would be. 

As if that whole experience wasn't cool enough, I met amazing people and saw other great acts. The whole weekend was magical and so much fun. 

I'm proud of how frugally-awesome this was. I didn't pay a cent, and in fact ate for free all weekend as there were complimentary meals for volunteers. 

I just wanted to share this with you guys and maybe inspire some others to volunteer next time a festival comes through your town that you want to attend. The Folk Festival treats their volunteers particularly well, but volunteering at any Festival is a good way to catch some live music for free.

I have a job that pays $8.50 an hour and I work full time. My father gets a small social security check that we use to help with rent. I've been doing my best but as of this past month Ive found with medication costs, bills, and gas for the car I can't even afford groceries. I'm starting to take the bus to work to save money but I feel awful.
My dad has been out of medication for his heart all week and we havent eaten much. I'm so thankful for everything I do have but I need to know what I can do to save money so we can consistantly have his medicine and food. I clip coupons, buy on sale and generic food. I feel like there must be something more i can do. I've lost my food stamps last year because supposedly i make enough money.
Thank you for any suggestions!

Edit: I'm sorry for my late reply, just got out of work. I'm honestly overwhelmed by all the helpful posts. Some of your ideas are so obvious I feel ignorant for not thinking of them before. I'm living in MI for all those asking. The SS check is $700 monthly.

I'm sorry, but I've decided to delete this post.

I had no idea it would attract so many comments. I honestly didn't. I was completely shocked when I logged in this morning and saw over 300 comments. It was a bit of a nasty shock, too. I have been so accustomed to living this way that I had no idea other people would perceive it as strange and controversial.

Because of the sheer number of comments and upvotes, one of my friends has seen this post, even though I purposefully posted this under a throwaway account. I accidentally shared a little too much personal information, and she put the pieces together and called me. I am so embarrassed. I really regret posting this. My friends don't know that I live this way. I never have them over to my place. I wear nice clothes and nice makeup when I'm with them, and they have no idea I live so cheaply. Two of my other friends know now, too. One of them has asked me if I need her to loan me some money so that I can spend more on food. I am so embarrassed. I never intended for my friends to see this side of me. I wanted them to think that I am a pretty girl with a great life and little problems; I spent so much time during my first few years of college adopting this outer shell, this aspirational identity, because I was so sick of being the depressed ugly quiet mousy Asian girl in bulky secondhand clothes in high school. I never intended for anyone to find out that I used to sleep on the same mattress with my mom and my brother, that I eat the same thing two days in a row, how stupid and sweaty and cheap I feel when I'm biking and there's a really steep hill and I'm just straining to push my bike up as I'm walking hunched over with a heavy bag of food on my back. But I shared it, foolishly thinking no one from real life would see this, and now everyone knows and I'm not the same person in their eyes anymore. I'm a hypocrite, a liar, a poser, like a woman from China I knew who ate nothing but ramen for months to afford a real Chanel bag.

If you will believe nothing else about this post, I beseech you to consider believing just one thing: I am a real human being, a 21-year-old young woman, not a troll, and reading some of the comments and the messages in my inbox that really berated me and put me down and called me names like anorexic and famished and eating shit food made me cry. **I'm not victimizing myself here, nor am I saying this is cyberbullying - it is not near those levels!** I'm just saying I can't handle being here and reading these comments and checking my inbox anymore because I'm much more emotionally fragile than the average 21-year-old. My family is nice to me, and so are my friends. I never got picked on. I've never been in a real physical or verbal fight. No one has ever said things to me like the things that have been said to me here. I freaked out and I just can't handle it anymore. I'm really trying to calm myself down as I'm writing this because I am upset and I think it would look even more stupid and immature if I started typing out expletives right now which have been drifting in and out of my mind.

That being said. I saw a lot of great advice on here and I thank you. I'm going to raise my budget and try out more food types. I'm going to start calculating my calorie intake to make sure I'm actually eating healthy. I'm still going to keep up my daily exercise, maybe go to my school's gym and ask if an employee can tell me about ways to measure my healthiness and fitness. I'm going to be as frugal as possible without veering into wrong and dangerous territory.

As I am typing this out I like to think that we are sitting across from each other, and I am speaking to you and having a real conversation. I am small, dark-haired in real life and have a small soft voice. I hope that if you care to envision the same scenario you would be - maybe not more accepting - but more empathetic of my words and my lifestyle.

1.  i bought my house in 2007, when everyone was excited about the 6% interest rates on mortgages.  about two months ago, i refinanced the house at 3.5%, which brought my payment down by $150 a month.  

2.  for the last 6 months or so, her car has been nothing but problems, on top of it being expensive in the gas department.  it got 25 mpg, but it could only take 91 octane gas.  it got to the point where it was costing about $200 a month in parts and repairs, even doing them all myself.  add to that the $70 a week in gas, payment, and insurance on a BMW, and this car was pushing almost a grand a month.  time to trade her in.  she got a new car, with warranty, and a payment only $50 more a month, but 30$ a month cheaper to insure, and getting double the gas mileage on cheaper gas.  total savings of $ 300 a month.  
3.  i didn't get a very good interest rate on my truck when i bought it.  a divorce can be hard on your credit rating.  when the bank ran our credit for the lady's car, they se the truck and it's ugly interest rate, and offer to refi at 7 points below what i had.  we were in the bank the next morning as soon as they opened.  come to find out, i was right side up on the truck, so i asked if they could finance some extra.  even with the extra, it dropped my truck payment by a full 175 a month.  

4.  the extra i got on the truck loan went straight back to the same bank, to pay my motorcycle loan in full, which frees up a further 160 a month...

lesson learned; look into refinancing after the halfway point of your car loans and watch the mortgage rates.  and just because a car is more expensive to buy, doesnt mean it's more expensive to own.  now, what can i do with all of this new found cash?  i plan on making double payments on the car and truck, then rolling all of that onto the mortgage after the fact.  i'll have my house paid off in 10 years time.",,False,,t5_2qhbe,False,,,True,t3_1do8j1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1do8j1/my_wife_and_i_have_just_freed_up_an_extra_960_a/,

1372344519.0,781,self.Frugal,1h6iki,I low balled two vehicle offers and got the price that I wanted. I feel like a king! or maybe an asshole.,1335,554,534,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1h6iki/i_low_balled_two_vehicle_offers_and_got_the_price/,"The first vehicle I low balled was my wife's 2000 Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer edition in 2010. We drove by one of the local car dealerships and saw it sitting in the back, probably waiting to be maintained or whatnot before they slap a price sticker on it and put it on the lot. We inquired about it and they let us look at it. We weren't really looking for a vehicle at the time. 

So, they keep calling my wife and she gave them my number and said that I would be doing all the dealing so they call me. At the time, the vehicle was 10 years old, but only had 60,000 miles on it. Very well maintained. Their price was $10,700. I told them that since the vehicle was 10 years old, take off $100 for every year, so $1,000. I told them I would need to buy new tires at $200/tire, so another $800 and they had a crack in the windshield so another $500. I then told them that since it's a gas guzzler and no one is in the market for a big SUV right now, my offer was $8,000 as is. They laughed and said, ""No sir, we can't let it go at that price"". Do you have a trade in, maybe?"" I told them no, and that I wasn't interested.

They called almost every day, sometimes 2-3 times a day. They were hurting for business because they had been the number 1 dealership in the city until these bigger known companies came over and took all of their business with much lower prices and better deals. They kept lowering their offer day by day, but I told them that if they couldn't give it to me for $8,000 that I wasn't interested and to not call me back and if they did, I would file a harassment complaint. They called back two days later and agreed on $8,000. 6 months later, they got bought out by a bigger company.

So, that was my first story, here's the second one. My son will be a senior this year and I was looking to get him a vehicle. So, he saw a truck on Craigslist that he liked. 2008 Dodge Dakota crew cab(4 door). He wanted $9,000(KBB value was a little over $10,000) so I emailed him and he said that he was away on business but his wife was home and she could show it to us. So, I got his address and we went to look at it. 

This guy lived out in the middle of nowhere. It took us almost 2 hours down dirt roads to get there. His wife let us test drive it down the driveway and I noticed that it had 117,000 miles. Overall nice truck, but the mileage was quite a bit. Since it was 5 years old, the yearly average mileage on this truck is 23,400 miles which is almost DOUBLE the recommended yearly driving of 12,000 miles.

I emailed the guy and told him we looked at it, but the mileage was a bit high, so I offered him $6,500. This is my calculation why I offered him that low. Being generous, I figure someone will drive a vehicle 12,000-15,000 miles a year, so going with the high number(15,000), he should have had 75,000 miles. For instance,  my wife's Expedition(mentioned above) is 13 years old and only has 88,000 miles. Subtract 117,000 from 75,000 which is 42,000 miles over the recommended. Divide 42,000 by 15,000 which is 2.8. For every 15,000 miles over, I knocked off $1,000 so that would be $2,800 off but I rounded it up to $6,500 which is what I offered.

Sorry about all the math, but he replied back laughing(hahaha) saying that he is listening to offers but my offer was ridiculous and for me not to contact him again and that he would be able to sell it within two weeks. I told him good luck and to have a nice day.

Every week, my son checked Craigslist and he re-posted the vehicle, going down $100 every week. After a couple of months, he was down to $7,400 so he emailed me back.

guy: hey man, $7,250 and the truck is yours.

me: oh, you still havent sold it yet?

guy: no, you still interested?

me: Yes, my offer stands at $6,500.

guy; come on man, this is a nice truck

me: yes, but too many miles.

guy: it's all highway miles.

me: Do you have proof that it's all highway miles?

Guy: no.

me: do you have proof that you serviced it every 3-4 months?

Guy: No.

me: My offer stands at $6,500. if you contact me again with a higher offer than my offer, I will go down $100 for every time you counter offer. Also, for every week that you don't take my offer, I will go down $100.

he didn't reply back that day, but the next day he emailed me.

Guy: fine, come get it. $6,500.

My son and I went with cash and he was pissed! After he did the bill of sale and whatnot and handed us the vehicle title and information, I extended my hand and said, ""Nice doing business with ya"" and he walked back to his house, slamming the door.

TL;DR I low balled the shit out of two vehicles, stood my ground and got them both for my asking price.

While this might not be the case for all parts/autoshops, it is worth asking which parts exactly they will be replacing so you can then check online to see how much you can save. Even a good shop can be charging too much for parts (the shop I went to was best rated in my area rated 26/30 on Google).

**Edit - To Consider:**

* Receiving broken parts (look at the return policy when ordering online). 
* You may not get a warranty with the mechanic (you have to decide whether the benefits outweigh the potential cost).
* Some mechanics may not like this because you are removing one source of their income. Be sure to review the bill so that you are not getting charged more in other areas (shop around/get quotes so that you are clear what the final bill will be).

I was really into cars and I bought it when I should've kept my older car which was running fine. The G35 cost me 17.5K for which I got a loan for with 6.5% interest since it was my first auto loan... 

After 3 years, I paid off the car. After maturing, I sold the car 6 months later for 17.5K (http://www.autopeek.com/LOuaiuF75TRr/) and bought a Mazda Miata for 4.1K which was the best decision ever (spent 1K on maintenance the first month because I was planning on keeping it forever). From all the interest and loan payments for the car, it deterred my school loan payments, for which I also had interest on since the subsidized interest ended 6 months post graduation. Now I look back at all the money I could have saved for whatever reason (emergencies, down payment on a house, stocks etc) and look back at my bad decision. What I should have done was tried to pay off my school loan asap and be debt free. 

My advice to recent graduates is to pay off those loans first and be debt free so you don't waste more money paying interest! I would have saved almost 10K from all the interest... that's a lot of money!

Edit: People have been mentioning that 20~30k is a small loan. I forgot to mention that I was forced to graduate in 4 years since I couldn't afford to go a 5th year, and I also received financial aid and a small academic scholarship for good grades in high school.

Edit2: Everyone says it is normal to graduate in 4 years. YES, that IS normal. I say I was forced to graduate in 4 because I WANTED to stay a 5th year to take classes that I was interested in rather than required classes for my major but could not financially afford to stay my 5th year.

How to make 4 basic sauces.,1047,275,260,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/e3i8m/make_cheap_thai_style_food_fast_how_to_make_4/,"I live in an area of the US where Thai food is unreasonably expensive.  $12 for a single serving vegetarian green curry is not unexpected.  This is a far cry from the $7-$8 dishes I could get back in Detroit that would feed me for two big meals.  I had to figure out how to do this myself.   I will show you how to make 4 sauces: Prig Khing, Green Curry, Red Curry and peanut sauce.  Leave out fish sauce for pure veg.  I sometimes keep the fish sauce in even though I cook veg.  I'm not saying these are the BEST or most authentic recipes out there but they are cheap, delicious and easy when you get tired of your frugal beans and rice.

What you need:
Sugar,
Soy Sauce or Salt,
Fish Sauce (Very cheap),
Lime Juice,
Coconut Milk (lite or regular),
Coconut Flakes (for moisture control),
Peanut Butter,
Thai Curry paste(red and green)

Your Thai Curry paste is the key.  Do not use the Thai Kitchen junk you find in grocery stores.  Go to an Asian store and get the Mae Ploy brand or Maesri.  They look identical  [Link for image](http://www.importfood.com/cpmp1404.html).  Buy the 14 oz tubs or get the 35oz if you eat Thai often.  These pastes can be used for many things.  The 4oz tins seem to have far less flavor so I would stay away from them.  Expect to pay $4-7 in a store.  One tub will last you 20 or more meals so this stuff is cheap.  They don't seem to go bad but loose some flavor after a couple months or so.  I always keep red curry and green curry around.

All these dishes follow this format so I will just outline the sauces 
1) Make sauce in a bowl
2) Cook vegetables (and meat/tofu)
3) Add sauce to cooked vegetables in pot/wok and heat through
4) If the sauce is too watery, add some coconut flakes to absorb some moisture
5) Eat.

Green or red Curry:  Combine the following.
1/2 can (shaken) coconut milk,
3/4 cup water,
1-2 tbs green or red curry,
1 tbs lime juice,
1-2 tbs sugar,
4-5 shakes of fish sauce,
Salt/soysauce to taste 

Peanut butter Sauce:  Combine the following.
1/2 cup peanut butter,
1 tbs red curry,
1/2 tbs lime juice,
1-2 tbs sugar,
4-5 shakes of fish sauce,
Whisk warm water in small increments till it turns into a loose sauce. 

Prig Khing Sauce: 
3 tbs red curry,
1 tbs lime juice + 1-2 tbs water,
2 tbs sugar,
4-5 shakes of fish sauce,
Salt/soy sauce to taste,
Toss with cooked green beans and choice of protein over heat.

(edited for spacing issues)

EDIT:  These sauces are spicy.  If you don't normally eat Thai then you might want to start with only 1tsp of curry instead.

EDIT: Vegan.  Shelled Edamame is awesome as a protein in Thai dishes.  Just skip the fish sauce and it's still very good.   Try mushroom or kombu broth instead of water to add some Umami.  The Kombu will ad a slight fishy flavor to replace the fish sauce.

EDIT: There are recipes by others for Pad Thai, Tom Yum, Pad See Ew in the comments.  smithjoe1 said ""Add palm sugar (instead of table sugar) and tamrind"" to improve the flavor.

As such we eventually found ourselves deeply in debt and being called by collection agencies demanding payment. The stress affected our sleep and our relationship. We decided to make the effort to live more frugally, pay off our debts and to never put ourselves in that situation again. We eventually paid off our debts and started looking at what was important to us, family, home, security and peace of mind.
 By making our purchases and spending really count and getting the most value from them, we have made that happen. I'm linking two pictures taken this past weekend. The first picture is the home we bought in September 2012 (taken July 7, 2013). It is our log cabin on 6 1/2 acres. The second picture is that of yesterday morning's gathering from the garden. These two pictures represent what working together and being frugal have done for us. Because of it, we are 100% debt free and live in what is our dream home.   The gatherings from the garden are the healthy and delicious fruits of our labor.
 Frugalites have a purpose for choosing the subreddit of r/frugal. Whether it is by necessity or choice, you have decided to reign in your spending and work towards a better life. You can make that happen and whether you love the city or the country, you can eventually pay off your debts and pursue your dreams. Even better, you can attain those dreams.

Taking the advice of other redditors, in addition to keeping better track of what I already have in stock and making other changes I have cut our bill down the last two months. January we tried to be more radical by not allowing any alcohol and only allowing 2 grocery visits the whole month, and spent 234.05, and we have only spent 223.52 so far in February and that includes a bottle of wine and a bottle of whiskey. I know we will probably need to make another small run to the grocery store this month for some fresh veggies/fruit and maybe bread if I don't have time to make it. 

Things I've done to cut the bill:

1. Track every penny on a spread sheet, I thought I was doing this but I'm doing it in more detail now, I keep my receipts in order by date as well to refer to.

2. I make a meal plan once a week, and we follow it for the most part. I also work 3, 12 hour shifts a week and make all my lunches in advance, which I was already doing, but now I'm packing better/healthier snacks and I'm less tempted to buy pre-packaged lunch items. 

3. I cut pop out completely, I drink water and use my Soda Stream and make my own soda syrup.

4. I still buy my meat at Costco, and split it with my mom

5. I only make one large shopping trip a month, usually in the middle of the month and try to use all the ingredients I can until then without having to go to the store, this here has saved us the majority of money. When veggies are close to going bad, I force myself to come up with something to use them in, or cook and freeze them for later use. We do make 1-2 other small trips in the month to get fresh veggies and fruits and odd ingredients.

6. Cut out a lot of alcohol, we didn't realize how often we were buying it until we went through our receipts and calculated what we were spending a month on it, we still buy it but just try and do less of it.

7. We include paper products, like paper towels and toilet paper, laundry detergent in our grocery budget, but we were going through paper towels very quickly, so we have started using old rags for spills and such and just throwing them in the washer throughout the week and end up washing them with our other laundry and that has cut down on our paper wasting significantly. 

8. Home made bread and pizza crust. I received a mixer for Christmas and started using it to make desserts as well, (banana bread from the bananas that are too ripe). I also buy a large bag of mozzarella cheese at Costco and split it with my mom, costing about 5 dollars for a TON of cheese to make many pizzas, plus the flour is really cheap at Costco as well. I buy a jar of the yeast at Kroger for a few bucks and that is pretty much all you need to make the beginnings of a cheap pizza. We eat pizza about 1 time a week, with leftovers for a snack or lunches. 

Edit:
I forgot one
I started buying the dried beans, and cooking them and freezing them. Even though I was buying canned beans at aldi before, buying dried and cooking yourself actually still saves a significant amount and if you freeze them in ziptop freezer bags, you can store them flat!

I hope this post can help someone else too!

Grand total after taxes $56 and some change. After paying we walked over to the Toys For Tots box and dropped it all in there. 

That's about $2.43 per kid we spent on. 23 kids will have something to unwrap on December 25 and it was a great feeling to have. 

I highly encourage those with patience and good frugal skills to try this over the next few weeks leading up to Christmas.

Wow. This thread really took off. Kinda goes to show you that there are some legitimate as seen on TV products out there.

I'm trying to think about some other products I have purchased. Ah, the Personal Power tapes by Anthony Robin. You know, motivational self-help tapes to get you fired-up about your life. I don't think I ever finished the set, but they did motivate me for a little while.

I always wanted to have the Ronco Rotisserie. The ""set it and forget it"" commercials. However, it was kinda out of my price range at that time... so I never bought it.

We rarely take vacations, we both work full time and often go weeks with out seeing each other.  We don't have a TV or a dog or kids but we have a big garden! We bought the place really run down and fixed it up quite a bit as well.  The value today is probably $120k as the place sits right now, but with a little more work it should be worth more than that.  Yesterday my wife made the last payment (after paying our taxes).  We are basically waiting for the bank to close the loan out and send us some promissory note that says that they have no lien on the property any more.  It has been quite an experience and I don't know how to feel just yet. I wanted to tell all you guys here at Frugal because I guess many of you are probably working towards a similar goal and I want you to all know that it is possible.  I really do look at the place a bit differently though since paying it off.  It feels much more like it is actually mine and not a rental from a bank.  It's not the best place, Its not in the greatest neighborhood, My driveway is a mud-hole because I can't afford to get cement poured yet but its all mine.  Its kinda strange and I wanted to share the experience with everyone!  I am 32 and my wife is 28 :&gt;)

We do get to see each other quite a bit but it is all at once.  Usually she will get 2-3 weeks off and I lean on my bosses to give me time off (traded for other days) at the same time.  It all comes at once so its easy to travel together or go on some cross country biking adventure or something like that.  It is a bit of an adjustment but she loves her career and I can to bug her at work pretty much any time that I can get a day off.  She is usually about 1-4 hours away from home when she is at work and just stays on site because travel is a bitch, especially in winter.  Its not a bad life though.

Instead, my fiance started using a cupcake pan
Putting a sausage patty made from the ground sausage she bought on the bottom of each cupcake slot

Optionally wrapping a piece of bacon around the edge

Cracking and egg into each slot 

Baking in oven

Refrigerating it



That's one option.

Another she does less often is use a lasagna dish and get together some ham, cheeses, and other breakfast ingredients and mix Em all in with a few eggs, then bake and refrigerate.

In the morning on the way out, I either grab a couple of the egg-cakes, or the egg lasagna (whichever is available). Stuff it in a ziploc and into the grocery bags we save from grocery store trips, then heat it up at work and have a delicious breakfast! 

I haven't counted personally but I can't imagine the ingredients for a whole tray costing more than 6-7 dollars if you already have the tray, and it usually lasts a week and a half sometimes two weeks

This is what I said:,1203,503,286,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/g9sft/att_asked_if_i_would_recommend_them_to_a_friend/,"Just a note to give the reader some context. I am a computer consultant that uses a wide range of technologies for both fun and profit. You might call me an early adopter. I subscribe to AT&amp;T's U-Verse cable/internet product, and use AT&amp;T for my family's cell phones. AT&amp;T asked if I would recommend them in a survey after I bought a phone from their store (the Atrix, the dual core Android smart phone from Motorola). This is what I said:

&gt;AT&amp;T is actively putting into place ~~bandwidth restrictions~~ data limits (both mobile and on the U-Verse platform (which we also use)) that are completely unacceptable. We can avoid some of these ~~bandwidth restrictions~~ data limits by sticking with 3G coverage and thus hold onto our grandfathered unlimited plan, but that isn't going to last very long. AT&amp;T is moving to a pseudo-4G (some might call it a Faux G) architecture for data. ~~To use the ""Faux-G"" access, I have to drop the unlimited 3G plan I have, and suck on the data limits on the new ""Faux-G"".~~ {see note 2 below}  And what limits they are! 2G per month download, or about half an hour of HD Video which my new Atrix smart phone can play over HDMI to my TV.

&gt;So in the very near future, I have to give up on the idea of downloading content over your wireless network on to my phone.

&gt;This leaves me to downloading over my home network, which uses AT&amp;T U-verse. You have just announced restrictions on downloading over THAT network to 250G starting in May. The restrictions on the U-Verse are particularly galling, as new technologies and new business models depend on delivering content over the Internet. Where we once might have avoided the phone data limits by using our home wireless, the increasing restrictions on our wireless (U-Verse) makes us very nervous.

&gt;AT&amp;T is a business, and as such it is understandable that their priority is to their investors. It is also understandable that customers (who have few if any other options) are very low in priority. But you asked why we wouldn't recommend AT&amp;T to a friend or colleague. Well, I WOULD recommend them to invest in AT&amp;T, but would NOT recommend them to become an AT&amp;T customer unless they absolutely had no other choice. This is the best alignment one can take to match AT&amp;T's priorities. (Cross posted to Reddit.com)

**note:** My suggestion that my friends should invest in AT&amp;T was intended as sarcasm.  Sorry if that confused people.

**note2:  I WAS WRONG** about what I have said in many replies about losing your unlimited 3G plan.  I called AT&amp;T and after a long conversation, they claimed you don't have to give up your unlimited plan to use AT&amp;T's new 4G thingy.  You do have to have your plan ""tweeked"" in some way, but you don't lose it.  But I was absolutely told I would lose it by the AT&amp;T salesman when I bought the new phone.  Be Careful Out There!

1372646427.0,696,self.Frugal,1hehbw,"Baby steps. I started budgeting early this year (earning $1.5k/mo) and reduced my credit card debt from $1,800 to $300, while paying off $5,000 of tuition for Spring semester and reaching my short term savings goal of $1,000 (more details inside).",1045,349,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1hehbw/baby_steps_i_started_budgeting_early_this_year/,"[Here is a graph of my credit debt over time.](http://i.imgur.com/uYRJAbm.png)

You can tell I didn't care about my credit card debt until a few months ago.  It's incredible how much a little planning and self discipline can get you! For context, I am a grad student (technically undergrad since I'm doing a combined BS/MS degree, which is why I paid tuition).  I still have a ton of student loans, but I'm just happy I have my credit card debt under control.

As an added bonus, my credit score shot up from 640 to 750!

Another perk of budgeting means that I can pay out of pocket for important expenses.  I'll soon be moving to a different city to start a PhD (tuition scholarship + health insurance!) and I've secured an apartment (first month's rent + security deposit).

I wish I could say more about what I've done to save money in terms of technology.  For example, I've been using the same Dell laptop since 2007 and I still use it every day for everything including gaming and programming.  I'll save this part for another day, or for anyone that asks.

NB: The math in the title won't work out too well, however accurate the numbers may be. I was paid in bulk for this summer, which allowed me to clear a lot more debt this month than in other months.

EDIT: more context since everyone is making funny assumptions. My family is very poor so we get a ton of financial aid in the form of loans and grants. The school I go to is good about that kind of thing, so I'll end up with 64k work of loans, which is relatively small compared to others with the same amount of need.

Each year tuition costs upwards of 50k. Grants and loans cover most of it, so I have to pay just 5k/semester for everything including housing and meal plan. So yes I was able to live on less than 500/mo and put that directly into savings.

Due to my low cost of living I was able to do everything in the title this semester alone. In the Fall semester I was spending all my extra money on random crap I don't even use anymore. This semester I took all my extra money and put it to paying off debt. I hope this clears up the confusion.

And the most insulting suggestion here is that I take money from my parents. That's not the case. I'd never ask for money from my parents who are no better off than I am.

EDIT 2: The frugality part is in a feeble post buried below. I have to go to work, but when I come back in about 5-6 hours, I will write a much more detailed post about the frugal aspects (I promise!). It wasn't an easy endeavor and there are a lot of things I'd like to share now that people have asked!!

I've been living in an environment where me and my family count every forint (hungarian currency) and watch where we spend, what we buy etc. So you might assume we go to the shop watching for sales, and looking for the cheapest everywhere.

This is not entirely true, as my father taught me (when i was very little) that if you want to spare money, you might want to calculate a bit and buy the more expensive one..

For example right now I use a pair of Lacoste boots for 12000 Fts (about 60 dollars) which is, to put in perspective, 1/10 of the family's monthly income. People migh think ""oh you are so poor, wtf are you doing in a so expensive boots""..

I could buy boots for about 2000 Fts (~10 dollars) but let me tell you one thing. I had *these* kind of boots for ten years and what I can say is that many times, even though they are 1/6 the cost.. they wont last 1/6 the time!

I had to buy a new boots every 3 month or so, because they were so bad in quality. That is 4 boots a year. I use this Lacoste pair for more than 2 years... and it was only 6 times the cost... During these 2 years I would have bought 8 ""cheap"" boots. So, over time, buying the ""very expensive"" boots (which is in PERFECT condition over 2 years of use) turned out to be the CHEAPER choice.

So our family now thinks this way every time we buy something. WE went so far, we calculated that buying our very own bread maker machine instead of buying bread from a shop every day, pays off itself in about 6-8 months. So after this period we make bread for half a price!

I could go on and tell better examples (like buying longer lasting materials for the house renewal, more expensive but healthy food etc) but I'm sure you figured out the philosophy by now.

happy calculating :D

When I first graduated pharm school my mom asked me to look at her mom's meds and see if I could control the costs. I lowered her yearly drug spending by over $1000. I have several examples now of patients who came in and asked and I was able to save them even more. In short pharmacists know what drugs cost and physicians largely don't. So walk into your pharmacy when it isn't busy, ask for the pharmacist. Give him a list with your health conditions and medicine and ask if he can find cheaper alternatives for any of them. Give him a day or two so he isn't rushed and can really look at the list and think. He will very often save you quite a bit of money if you do this. When you get a new medicine walk up to the pharmacist consultation window first and asking there is a cheaper alternative. If you must use a brand name med look on the Internet for a manufacturer coupon. But keep in mind there is probably a generic medicine that is much cheaper than your brand with coupon. Finally if you are on Medicare go to Medicare.gov every November and review you current med list with the plans to find the cheapest plan for you.

With a lot of cost cutting strategies and careful planning, we got there pretty quickly (around 2 months). Now, we're working on building our savings so that we'll have an emergency fund, plus 3-4 months of expenses. Our goal is to have a total of $6000 in savings by February. After that, we're going to start saving to Treat Yoself! so that we can go on a nice trip for sometime around October of next year.

",1074,411,177,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/165lxp/a_new_frugal_game_and_way_to_go_out_i_created/,"We were planning a trip to the park and it ended up being a rainy day so we sat around in the morning trying to find something to do in town that only costs about $5 per person (what we would have spent on food/gas since the park was far out). Then it hit me **The $5 Challenge**.

The rules are simple: 

*Go to a gas station/grocery store and buy a candybar to get $5 cash back, the candybars become the winnings. You don't have to use cash, but it adds to the fun, it's also easier to do a sudden death if you already have the exact amount.*

*Whoever can find the coolest thing for $5 wins. Visit thrift stores, clearance aisles, etc. and shop! But be careful, if you purchase to soon you may miss out on something later! That's the gamble! (in our case it was something to furnish our apartment for next year when we move)* 

*The item can cost anything up to $5.99 with tax, but not a cent more. (you can adjust as needed, even try a $10 challenge) That way you can still purchase an item that costs $5 exactly or $4.99. We liked the wiggle room.*

*Ties go to the cheaper item if comparable coolness.*

*Sudden death (if necessary) is whoever can find something to buy with the remaining change or about $3. (how much we had left and seemed like a tougher challenge to decide the winner)*

We ended up getting a cool wine coaster for putting your bottle of wine on a table while hosting ($4), and a neat red bowl for throwing keys in at the door ($3). We got to scratch the itch of getting things for our apartment but only spent $10 between the two of us. We also spent about 2hrs just window shopping and hanging out around town for super cheap! 

This week we're going to start the $10 Challenge dinner! Who can make the tastiest dinner this week? (hopefully with enough leftovers to go a night and lunch) This challenge can easily apply to any spending. Who can be the most efficient?

Edit: As snutr mentions, this is merely a benchmark. Obviously you don't **need** to spend 12% of your income on clothes, but you are at least able to compare your spending against some sort of norm. In my case, I spend waaaaay less than this on housing and I don't have life insurance. So these differences can be added somewhere else (savings for example). I also spend more on transportation than this budget calls for, which I can't really do anything about so I just have to understand that.

nice job...thought it could be of value here. The 
budgeting trick with direct deposit and free 
accounts really allowed me to get my act together. ",875,235,190,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/10pxuh/a_letter_i_recently_wrote_to_a_friend_who_just/,"Now that you have some serious **$$$,$$$'s** rolling in let me offer some advice I wish I had right away. Take it or leave it. Fuck, throw it away and come back to it in a year or two and go party you earned it. Seriously, the world might end in two years and fuck it all. 

**Budget**. Use free accounts and direct deposit to do all the work. My paycheck is deposited in 3 different accounts plus a 401k and reimbursement checks into a 4th account. Do your budget monthly.  Your paychecks are probably every other week.  The result is 2 months out of the year all your accounts will get a ""bump"" from the extra paychecks that month (26 paychecks a year vs 24 if it were 2 a month). The exact details might differ for you but the principles are all the same so pay attention. 

**401k**. Contribute whatever money your employer will match. Free money, don't fucking argue. 
  
**Bill Pay Checking** (free local credit union w/ online bill pay):  
Put all your bill money into this account, divide your paycheck assuming two per month. If rent is $1000 a month put $500 per paycheck into this account. Pay the most frugal way possible, buy insurance 6+ months at a time. If $600 for 6 months of insurance it's $50 per paycheck. Put all your known bills here (rent, student loans, utilities, gas, train pass, insurance, everything except food), round up and over estimate. Set automatic payments on everything you can and go paperless statements. Never worry about bills again, welcome to the 21st century.  
  
**High Yield Savings**. (free local credit union):
Try and maximize. Don't spend...unless buying a house or ski resort.  
  
**Play Checking**. (Schwab account, free world travel ATM ;) 
Sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll. Balancing act with savings account, challenge yourself to minimize this account. If you eat out at expensive restaurants more you'll have less money for drugs. If you cook at home more you can buy a new gadget. If you spend more on clothes you have less money on beer. You get the picture.  
  
**Reimbursement**. (free local credit union w/ online bill pay)   
Deposit all business expense checks here, airfare, hotels, rental cars, meals, gas etc. Pay all those bills with a cash back credit card and pay back weekly when reimbursement checks come in. 
  
**Personal Results**. (your mileage will vary)  
401k: It grows quicker than you expect. Even in down economies if your employer matches you are immediate up. The economy would have to be totally fucked to make this a bad investment and in that case the size of your ammo collection matters more than your 401k.  
  
Bill pay.  You never worry about bills. You over estimate and the ""bump"" pads it even more. It's not uncommon to have a couple thousand dollars padding in here and all of a sudden your season lift pass is a ""bill.""  
  
Savings.  Buy property with 20% down and it's cheaper than rent. Buy a ski condo or a duplex. Fuck you money, next time you are laid off buy a ticket to a 3rd world country to celebrate for a few months.  
  
Play Account. If you are trying to buy a ski resort hold back and transfer any left overs in this account to your savings account each pay period. If you want to buy the latest tablet or powder ski let it build for a few weeks.  
  
Reimbursement. Pays all business expenses plus maintenance on the truck, new tires, etc. This account still has several hundred dollars padding for unexpected repair bills because of the mileage reimbursement.  

**Expert level tips**:  
Link every account online with every other account to enable quick transfers. Online bill pay lets you pay anyone with a check, it doens't have to be a bill. I write checks to my friends with online bill pay...it's a free service they mail the check for you.  
  
Pay everything with a % cash back credit card and immediately payoff in full each week.  I received $500 cash back in the last year on $0 in interest/fees. Deposit in savings account.   

Frugal doesn't mean cheap. A $300 pair of shoes can last your life with a couple $100 cobbler visits. A $50 pair of shoes can be worn out in 6 months. Or that same $50 shoe, if you buy 2 pairs and wear every other time will last more than twice as long. Both strategies require a greater expense up front so they are not cheap.  
 
After you pay off your vehicle keep ""paying"" the payments Save it. Pay for the next in cash. Take what very little you need out to maintain and upgrade current paid off vehicle. 

Bill budget about equal to Savings budget &gt; Play budget 
  
**EDIT**  
  
So one of the implied benefits here but not really stated...I don't keep a checkbook or write any purchases down but I am always on budget, know how much I have, and have an online record of everything. I do have nice long term spreadsheets and graphs and can print out online transactions for records. 
  
What ever is in my play account I can splurge with, its only serious purpose is to feed me for two weeks. The savings is automatic and I don't touch it.

We live in Australia where supermarket prices can be twice as much as the US (source: one of us is from the US).  We eat quite well and not just beans &amp; rice.  Thought this might interest fellow aussies, especially if anyone is doing the Live Below the Line challenge this week. 

Main points (already well covered in this subreddit)

* eating minimal meat

* making food from scratch

* having the time and interest to do this

* not eating out

* buying fruit &amp; veg at ethnic/discount supermarkets (eg Aldi, or Spud Shed in WA) or only what's on special at conventional supermarkets

This is what we eat:

Breakfast - cereal &amp; fruit with homemade soy milk or homemade yogurt

Lunch - sandwiches on homemade bread or wraps or left overs

Dinner - examples from the past few weeks include thai curry, indian curry, burritos, pasta, pizza, chinese, moroccan vegs &amp; couscous, vietnamese spring rolls, etc.

Snacks - fruit, nuts, carrot sticks &amp; hummus, tea &amp; biscuits, etc

Instead of meat we eat eggs, beans, tofu, TVP (texturised vegetable protein) and heaps of vegetables. We make our own bread, yogurt, pasta, pizza dough, bean sprouts, soy milk, pickles, etc.  Can't wait for the garden &amp; chickens to get going!

(We are not poor - we just love cooking &amp; living simply which results in more freedom and less stress on the job front)

So it is possible to live quite cheaply in Australia, despite the high cost of living, but it does require time and effort.

Now it is just my mother and I in the house and there is no way we can manage the payments. We live in Minnesota, and need to either sell the house before the winter (Sept-Nov) or face forclosure. The house could use quite a bit of work to sell, however she believe she could sell and possibly make a small profit. I don't know the process to sell a house or what our options are at the moment, and she is depressed and a slight hoarder (nothing terrible, but we have a lot of junk to get rid of/store). Any advice would greatly appreciated, and if this is too vague I can go into more detail.  BTW, I am a 22 year old college student, and she is nearly 60 and has a part time book keeping business. 

If this is the wrong subreddit, or you know of a better place for this, please let me know and I'll gladly crosspost there. I'm just a little lost, overwhelmed and scared.

Edit: So everyone is basically saying we should talk to the lender about refinancing or at least postponing foreclosure and this is obviously the best option. Well the kicker is the mortgage company doesn't know my grandmother passed away a year ago and we've been paying it ourselves ever since. I was afraid of including that in the initial post for fear of possible legal issues and my mother is afraid to talk to the lenders because she thinks they will immediately foreclose. We've been keeping up with the payments as much as we could (mother used all of her savings and retirement), but we're 2 payments behind and will be a 3rd this month. Should we talk to the mortgage company and let them know she passed away last year at the risk of foreclosure, or should we try and sell at a small profit to at least get something out of the house?

We were skyping last night and he let me in on a little secret. Gas companies hire his business to keep their pumps accurate because more often than not, the pumps are giving away more gas than they are calculating, and in the event that it works in favor of the company it self, they receive a huge fine.

Well the trick goes like this, the calibration is only applied when the pump is being used at full flow. It's common knowledge among these employees that if you use the pump at its lowest setting, the calibration is incorrect and the pump it self does not keep accurate track of how much fuel is coming out. Which means, if you use the pump at its lowest setting, or if you have the time to hold it until its barely coming out, you will get more gas than you pay for... according to him, depending on the amount you intend to put in or how long you spend filling up, it could be up to a gallon for every fill up. 

This might not be the most honest way to stretch that dollar, but as far as I'm concerned, the people selling us the fuel aren't the most honest people to begin with.

Hey everyone!  So we are getting a fair amount of new readers to this sub, and we're seeing a LOT of the same types of posts coming through.  While I think it is a great thing for people to live a more frugal lifestyle, I think we can help alleviate some of the issues with these reposts.  While the recent post [A List of Things I have Learned from R/Frugal](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/tob1g/a_list_of_things_i_have_learned_from_rfrugal/) was really helpful, I think we as a community can do better!  

So each week I will make a thread on a specific topic, and we as a community will talk about the best tips we can give.  I will then update the text portion, so that once it is linked on the side-bar new readers will easily be able to find the best of the best. 

Below you will see that I have a short list of topics I think we see the most of, but if there is something else you guys want to have a thread about, mention it here as a top-level comment, and I will put it on the list.  Also, I'm not sure if how I have the topics distributed is the best way, so let me know if you think we should change it up.

No downside whatsoever!  Works for my hands too.  Uses less water.  Just spray my hands, rub a little, use a little water, and I GOT CLEAN FRESH MANOS!

I'm going to do the same with Vinegar &amp; water because it's not sticky (for the floor) and it evaporates without having to be rinsed, and bleach for....well, you know!

Her exact example is: How hard is it to get liquid soap off of your hands?  And then it clicks: Yeah, that shit stays around forever.  And THAT's what it does in your washing machine.  You have to use minute amounts, or.....just use the dry soap in your washing machine.

I'd like to say thank you to everyone for your wisdom and your insight! I'm down to $2,243 in debt thanks in part to this community and wanted to give a little something back..

I can say that the number thing that has helped me become more frugal in the last few months has been to keep my home clean.

- It saves money on cleaning products because if you KEEP it clean you don't have to buy expensive products to cut through all the grime. A simple wipe down with a wet rag will do.

- Clean your cat litter more often and your cat will like you more and you'll use less litter. 

- It saves money at the store because when my home is clean and organized I know exactly what I have and don't have so I stopped buying duplicates.

- Lastly, for me, I used to come home and see my filthy house and not want to be there. So I would leave, go out to eat, go party, and come back only when it was time to go to sleep so I wouldn't have to deal with being here. I spent a lot of money to get out of the house. Now that my house is clean, I enjoy spending time in it. :) I also enjoy asking my friends over, whereas before that was an impossibility. They also enjoy that rather than go spend $25 on drinks and food, we can eat here and watching something on Netflix and $25 will buy us ALL drinks. We also avoid the risk of someone getting a DWI from driving around downtown intoxicated. :)

I think that no matter how nice of a place you live in, if you take pride in it, and keep it nice that you'll enjoy spending time there more and therefore spend less money being somewhere else.",,False,,t5_2qhbe,False,,,True,t3_vm78b,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/vm78b/a_clean_home_is_a_frugal_home/,

Since I was very young I have had a passion for dumpster diving, junking, etc. I'm truly my happiest at the bottom of a dumpster or climbing through wrecks at a junkyard. When I was a senior in Highschool, I was taking a drafting class with four students. We were playing around on some CAD software we had, and me and another student decided to try and design the smallest livable house we could conceive. We both came up with a design we really liked, blended them, and agreed on a final plan. I started thinking ""How hard can it be to build?"" 

I talked with our teacher, who is one of the coolest people I've ever met. I asked him, and he said ""I love the idea, but we have absolutely no funding. Not even to buy pencils, much less this."" My response was, ""No problem, I got this.""

Every day after class I'd get in my decrepit '84 Landcruiser and make my rounds. The town dump, local job sites, etc. I'd find lumber, sinks, doors, windows, etc. The dump had my cell number on speed-dial and would call me if they had something. The waste was amazing. I once climbed in the dumpster of a local Mcmansion being built and found 27 8' 2X6's. Uncut, tag still on them, not warped. They had literally been bought, delivered, and thrown away. Some windows were old, some were new, for example two of the windows were last year's display models used by the window companies. I found tile, wiring, siding, etc. It only took 2 months to be in the dry, and within 4 months it was essentially done. 

While not 100% complete, it's certainly livable at this point. It's dry, warm, has power, etc. While the labor is a huge factor, it's amazing how much can be done for so little money. Not accounting for tools of course, but still,... 

The best part is, walking into it, you'd never know it was built for less than ten dollars. The floors look normal, the walls are straight, the wiring works as it should, etc. Let me know what you guys think. I hope to finish it next time I have a break from school, hence why the blog hasn't been updated in a while. All in good time. 


EDIT: Answering a couple of questions that everyone seems to ask.

Is it built to code? Technically, yes. In my county and structure less than 12'x12' does not require a permit, even if it is a house. Therefore, no code enforcement. That being said, it is built stronger than code in many areas. My next door neighbor is the building inspector, and he's checked it and says it's great. Hurricanes are a regular occurrence, I didn't cut corners.

Secondly, the gas issue. Well, yes, I used gas scavenging. But there are a couple factors. Driving to Home Depot to buy lumber still uses fuel, so it's not an expense specific to **this** house. Secondly, I used to go driving after school anyway, I enjoy it, so it wasn't a burden. I derived pleasure from the driving, so it's kind of an entertainment expense. I was also working in a small, approximately 20 mile, radius. I'd estimate I drove 15 extra miles everyday because of this project. Over 60 days, that's 900 miles, 60 gallons for the Toyota, so $180 dollars give or take. Not a ton of money, honestly.

Lastly, yes, **everything** was free. Nails, screws, paint, cabinet hinges, etc, except the light switches which is what I spent the $8 on. But the labor is intense. I could have saved a lot of time of time by buying stuff. I don't claim for this to have been an efficient exercise, it was simply a challenge I set out.

[Here's some photos!](http://imgur.com/a/817a1)

I live in the UK. We've had a HOT summer this year, but crops don't seem to be fairing any better than usual. My point is your climate is irrelevant, you can grow *something*.

There's a lot of negativity surrounding growing things on here... A ""its not worth it"" or ""it costs too much time/money"" attitude and complaining about how regrown celery doesn't contain much goodness, as if celery did in the first place... Personally, I think the key to a successful frugal life is that everything is worth trying if it costs you nothing but time. If you end up with something, even if it's just a hobby, what is there to loose?

You'll find more info on specifics in the gallery above. If you have any questions, criticisms or suggestions please share! :)

1346182723.0,563,self.Frugal,yz7bz,"After reading that post by that other college student, I thought I'd share how I live a slightly higher quality of life for about the same price ($495/month)",807,244,407,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/yz7bz/after_reading_that_post_by_that_other_college/,"There was a LOT of criticism in the comments of the other post. I completely understand why too. I am a college student as well, studying computer science and mathematics, and one of my favorite past times is crunching number to try and figure out how to save money. So here are some of my own tips!

**Rent - $312**

I live with my girlfriend less than a mile from our university. We both have bikes. Rent is $625 and we split it equally. For some that don't have the advantage of having a SO to split the cost of living with; I also have friends that rent a room in a house from $200-$400, and most of the houses that surround our campus are used specifically for renting to college students. Furthermore, there are a ton of ads on craigslist for people wishing to split their 2-bedroom apt or rent out a room in their house!


**Utilities- $15** 

If you have a low income you can get financial assistance with your utilities. I live in California and thus use PG&amp;E. My GF and I are on their [CARE program](http://www.pge.com/myhome/customerservice/financialassistance/). Our bill would be nearly twice as much if we weren't on this program. We also, of course, do basic things like not blast the AC (we keep it at 80F) and open the windows at night.


**Food - $70**

This is really where most of my number crunching comes in. I actually built a program that analyzes receipt data and allows me to keep a database of the average cost of my groceries from various grocery stores. Then I can make a grocery list and automatically get a list of the cheapest places to buy from. You don't really need a program for this though. Just remember what things are more expensive where.

I'm a skinny 6'3"" 22 year old and I can put down a lot of food. I probably pack away at least 2500 calories a day. What we usually end up buying are a LOT of frozen vegetables (probably 6-8 pounds a month) that we mix in to our various dishes. Usually peas, spinach, and broccoli. 8 pounds of this mix is usually about $10 a month. Mix this in with noodles in a casserole or in omelettes, or make a delicious vegetable soup out of them. We also use chicken as our main meat which we get from Costco at $1 a pound. We throw it into our casseroles and omelettes usually. My girlfriend has also recently been on a chicken/cabbage pot sticker craze. A 20lb bag of chicken from Costco lasts us 3 months.

Cabbage and Onion are also REALLY inexpensive, REALLY healthy, and REALLY delicious. We try to include those two things in all sorts of things that we cook. We also make lots of food at once, and freeze half of it for when we're too lazy to do more cooking.

When we do cave in and indulge in some Ramen, we usually throw in some of those frozen vegies and make it into a sort of vegetable soup where Ramen is just the base. Also we only use half of the seasoning packet as we both find using all of it makes it way too salty.

Also, a sidenote. There are days when I'm at school for 10 hours of the day. This might make it very tempting for some to go and grab something to eat. I always pack a lunch though. I cannot emphasize enough that I never buy food from anywhere but a grocery store. At Costco they have a 3lb variety pack of lunch meats for $3.33 a lb. Slap it into two slices of some whole grain bread (also from costco, like $5 for 2 loaves), throw some cabbage on that and you have a delicious sandwich!

With all that said, I can't possibly list my entire grocery agenda here because it is constantly changing. The most important thing in a diet is variety. There is no way in hell that I'm ever going to resort to noodles and potatoes every night. Even if they are cheap, I'd rather spend more for a healthier diet.

The most popular things in our diet are: eggs, cheese, pinto beans, brown rice, flour tortillas, chicken, whole grain bread, broccoli, peas, spinach, and cabbage.


**Internet - $15**

We've been on the ""Introductory Rate"" from Comcast for 2 years. We have 20Mb/s internet. Call them up, threaten to cancel, and either receive the introductory rate or allow them to cancel it and then re-open an account in room mate's name.


**Phone - $27**

I'm grandfathered in to Virgin Mobile's $25/month plan. I've had my Optimus V for 2 years. Nothing fancy, and the fact that I'm grandfathered in means that I'm gonna keep this phone until it dies. Really, if you want to be frugal don't have an overly fancy phone. It's not worth it.


**Laundry - $5**

Really, $5 a month. $1.50 a load. 3-4 loads a month. Hardly worth mentioning. Although, we do hang dry our laundry. No way in hell we're paying another $1.50 for a machine to blow some hot air on our clothes.


**Transportation - $2**

I live less than a mile from school, remember? That said, the cheapest grocery stores are also the farthest. So I do have to drive there on occasion, but that is literally the only place I ever drive. Fuel costs are near negligible because it's maybe only 5 miles away.


**Textbooks - $0**

That's right. This semester I have paid $0 for books. How you ask? Some good googling and if that fails, [this is how](http://instructables.com/id/Bargain-Price-Book-Scanner-From-A-Cardboard-Box/). Unethical? Maybe, but so are book prices.


**Misc - $50**

Those unavoidable costs. $50 might seem a little high, but this is only where I budget myself. $50 is a safety net. If I don't have $50 to spend on a random act of unavoidable expense then I might be caught in a shit storm. Most months I usually only spend $10-15, but I still keep the budget at $50, because there are some months where I'm forced to spend $100 on some bullshit.

As far as keeping those misc costs down. Just follow some common sense. For example, go dumpster diving when school gets out (I score all sorts of awesome stuff from this) or if you need household things immediately, go to a thrift store. Just the other day I needed a new spatula. I bought one for $0.25 at the thrift store down the street.



There it is r/frugal! I usually pride myself on being extremely frugal, but if you have any criticisms or questions then bring them on! Another note is that I do have an income. I'm a programmer though, so it's under the table and usually can be done entirely from home

I knew my 1 year agreement with comcast was up soon, and I was eager to test my insight. Called in, asked for the retention dept saying that my call was dropped(fake).

Results may vary.

Rep shop if necessary, but be careful since they can make notes in the system.

Call on Saturday since it's generally busier and reps want to be in and out of calls quickly.

Don't ask to talk to a manager/supervisor unless you have a real problem/complaint. Managers/supervisors are in those positions because they are good at there  jobs.

* The air conditioner running is your enemy.  We will do our best to minimize this sin.
* The amount of time it's on is just a cumulative thing.  One hour or ten six-minute spurts counts for the same thing.
* Your house ""loses cold"" proportional to the temperature difference between inside and out.

This is what we did last summer.  I'll try to lay it out like a normal day so there's some order.

When you wake up, drink your first glass of ice water for the day.  Staying hydrated will help you feel much cooler than otherwise.  As you get ready to go to work, take a *cold shower*, as cold as you possibly can.  For every extra bit of warmth you make for hot water, you're going to pay for it twice because you will then run the air conditioner to make it cool again.  Also hot showers are much bigger generators of shower steam that will unpleasantly coat your bathroom with moisture.  Your air conditioner dehumidifies the air in your house, so if we're going to be using it very little, our secondary battle to fight is to minimize the amount of humidity we introduce to the house.

Before you leave for work, turn off *everything*.  Your cable box running at about a hundred watts?  Off.  Computers, lights?  Off.  If these things are on, they're all going to generate waste heat all day, that you will wish wasn't in your house when you get home.  Turn off your air conditioner - there's no use for it if nobody's in the house - and close all windows, blinds, and curtains before you leave.

Don't have a job, or don't work during the daytime?  Still do as much as you can to cluster all of your trips around 1pm-6pm, the hottest time of the day, and follow these same instructions.  This isn't strictly frugal, but if you're going to see movies or go to restaurants anyway, do lunch, and matinee shows, and stay in their magnificently cooled buildings.  Get your shopping done in the daytime.  Go to the library, pool, or gym.

Now you're done with work and your quotidian activities.  You will come home and find that the house is significantly warmer than you'd like, probably 85F.  First, drink a glass of ice water.  Now you can take two routes:

* Turn on the air conditioning now and stand under the vent for a second for the psychological benefit.  It will always be a good feeling and worth it.
* Fight it for as long as possible.  Get naked, direct a fan at your body.  Wrap a wet towel around your head.  We are introducing a little humidity but it's for your direct benefit so the balance is fine.

Whichever of these you do will also depend on if you have roommates or family who may not want to see you going to such extremes.  Eventually you will turn the air conditioning on.  **Don't set your thermostat lower than your preferred temperature.**  It won't work to cool the house any faster.  Now, what should your preferred temperature be?  If you can't say at least 78F, you should rethink your commitment to frugality, but you're a real champion if you go for 80F or 82F.

By this point in the day it's evening, temperatures and the sun are starting to slowly go down.  Have a cold dinner, like sandwiches, salad, or the like.  Use your microwave to cook instead of the oven if you must.  Drink a glass of ice water.  Avoid cooking huge roasts or boiling things, for these will add a lot of heat and humidity to your place.  Keep those blinds and curtains shut.

Eventually at night the temperature outside will get lower than your preferred temperature.  Take advantage of this:  turn your air conditioner off and open up those windows.  Try to open up windows opposite from each other so you can catch a breeze, which will help to circulate your stale, hot, damp air.  You're permitted to use a fan to try to assist the breeze.  Drink a glass of ice water.

Save all your heat-generating activities, such as running the dishwasher or clothes dryer, oven cooking, taking hot showers, for the night.  When you are finally ready to go to bed, leave those windows open, and sleep as close to naked as you can.  Again a fan next to your bed at night can do wonders for how good your sleep feels.  Drink a glass of ice water before bed.

If you live in most of the US it will get to the point where the nightly low is only as low as 75F or even higher.  As long as it's 78F or lower go ahead and at least try to get a breeze through your house.  If it never goes below your preference temperature, just leave your thermostat on through the night, and thank your lucky stars you're saving enough money in the day that you don't need to feel guilty about it.  Or turn it off or up.  Once you get to sleep you won't notice the difference.

Using all these techniques last summer kept our electric bill at about half the cost of friends with similar apartments.  I'll end the post with some caveats about all of this.

* If you have an indoor pet don't torture it by letting your house heat up every day.  Just take the hit and think of this as part of the cost of pet ownership.
* You may have a temperature-sensitive hobby project like homebrewing or a server rack.  Again you are better off just paying for the air conditioning rather than ruining your project.
* If you begin to notice dampness in the house, abandon ship and just keep the thermostat on all the time.  Not worth ruining your house with mold to save any amount of money on the electric bill.
* Drink a glass of ice water.

  Part of why I practice frugality is because it unplugs me from the corporate pimp chain. I hate big banks so I use the credit union. I do not like how Walmart treats their employees so I don't shop there. I don't like what the Teabaggers/Koch brothers are doing so I don't buy their paper products.

That made me pause.  Then look for verification... which I found in this [interesting comment thread in the Week 5 ""Energy"" post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/yl2uf/we_rfrugal_week_8_energy_saving/c5wl2xr)

______________


&gt;A typical hair dryer draws 1875 watts of power.
&gt;
&gt;All 1875 watts have to go somewhere. No matter what happens inside the box, if there’s 1875 watts of power being used, eventually there will be 1875 watts of heat flowing out.
&gt;
&gt;This is true of any device that uses power, which is a handy thing to know. For example, **people worry about leaving disconnected chargers plugged into the wall for fear that they’re draining power. Are they right?** 
&gt;
&gt;**You can use heat flow to come up with simple rule of thumb: If an unused charger isn’t warm to the touch, it’s using less than a penny of electricity a day. For a small smartphone charger, if it’s not warm to the touch, it’s using less than a penny a year.**
&gt;
&gt;This is true of almost any powered device (though not necessarily those plugged into a second device. If a charger is connected to something, like a smartphone or laptop, power can be flowing from the wall through the charger into the device.)

",914,377,602,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/rfxqr/bargaining_phrase_you_should_try_every_time_you/,"I was never good at bargaining, but fortunately my husband is great at it. 

My husband has used the phrase ""I can't pay that"" and saved thousands of dollars. For example:

* $2000 for health care: when he was uninsured and had to go to the emergency room, he talked to the hospital and said he couldn't afford it. They offered him ""charity"" so he didn't have to pay anything. He still had to pay $1000 to the fire department for the ambulance and for the damn fire truck to escort him to the hospital literally 1 mile away. He worked out a monthly payment of $25 a month with no interest.
* $600 on autocare just yesterday. He took his car to an auto repair shop and they said the cost was $1100. He said he couldn't pay that. Then the auto guy said he can do an alternative method and that it would only cost $500.  He said he would talk to his wife first. Then the auto guy made a phone call, and brought the cost down to $300. After my husband left, he got a phone call saying that there were more repairs needed, so he brought the estimate back to $500.
* $500 (I don't remember exactly) on dental work when he didn't have insurance. When the receptionist said how much it would cost, he said he couldn't pay that amount, so they asked him how much he was willing to pay. He gave an amount and they took his offer.

Bonus stories about my mom bargaining:

* My mom is a shameless bargainer and money saver and I mean SHAMELESS. When I played the flute in middle school, the music store had a ""first 3 months free rental"", so she would return the flute after 3 months and then rent one again to get the 3 months free again. The clerk was annoyed with her and said they didn't allow it. So she asked to speak with a manager over the phone and she ended up getting the flute for free again. The clerk looked so pissed. Like I said, shameless. I could never do that.
* My mom is Korean, so she would become buddy-buddy with all the Koreans in our neighborhood. She agreed to attend this man's church so she could get a discount on auto repairs.
* My mom also attempted to bargain with a police officer over parking illegally. It didn't go over well, but by luck she got away with it. Don't try this.

Edit:
You know what, after reading some of the harsh comments, I really need to add.

 My mom came from a poor background in a 3-rd world country. Bargaining is the norm there and not frowned upon unlike the United States. I gave the most extreme examples of her trying to save money. 

I feel like some of you have never been poor and actually just choose to be frugal. Poor people don't have a choice.
My husband was technically in poverty and was part of the working poor for most of his youth. And I worked with inner-city youth, and lots of people in poverty have to do things to save money. I think you should get off your moral high horse until you experience how miserable and soul-sucking living in poverty can be, especially when you can't afford health insurance or higher education or rent that isn't 50% of your income. My husband actually bargained. The dental work and the auto repair was pre-service. The $3000 doctor's bill for some pepto bismol says more about hospitals than my husband not having health insurance when he was poor. 

Edit 2:
Many of you assume the hospital/auto repair shop/ dentist were being ""generous"" and being ""conned"" by my husband and not the other way around. The hospital offered financial aid to my husband after he truthfully discussed his financial situation. He also got coil springs instead of air suspension bags, but he still paid for labor. I don't remember the details with the dentist since it was awhile back, but they could have easily said no or offered a payment plan (which they've done for me). This post was to help people who are struggling. Obviously many of you don't need this level of frugality and it's beneath you, but it could save a person from being burdened by overwhelming debt. Discussing payment plans and discounts are usually not considered because everyone assumes that there's no room to negotiate. I think it's telling that many jumped to the conclusion that poor people are gaming the system instead of the other way around, and that a car shop was being ""generous.""

We don't have an enormous income (ranging from $70-80k combined over that time), I attribute our success to being motivated (Thanks Dave Ramsey - though we didn't follow his plan completely), tracking our finances, and trying to do without.  I don't dare consider ourselves ""frugal"" because we do still spend money on stupid and unnecessary things, but at least it's been money we've had, not money we've borrowed.  Our #1 financial priority was always paying those loans off, so even though we could have done better, I think we did a great job overall juggling between a ""normal life"" and ""being stingy"".

Some numbers:  **$51,541.87** is approximately **$2193.27/mo** or **$72.28/day**.  

A big help was the $8k tax credit received for being first time home buyers, our return was over $10k last year.  On the flip side, however, we paid more than $10k out of pocket (down payment, closing) when we bought our home in the first place (a lot of that was wedding gifts and savings from before the wedding - which again we paid for by ourselves), so I consider that a wash.

We work in industrial sales so very tough on our clothes, this is not a desk job where you are sitting for 8 hours. 5 years of experience brought me to my system.

**TLDR**Every week I save the following on cleaner costs ($25-50 suits depending on staining, and $4 x 5 for shirts), below runs you through how I do it.

It is a work in progress, feel free to make some suggestions:

**Clothing Selection:**

* For daily wear you will need 2-3 dark color wool suits at minimum, this will allow for 'resting' the material between wears. I bought quality on the cheap by scouting my local mens-wear stores and outlets. Surprisingly I found the longest lasting suits I owned were from Tommy, good quality material that does not fade nor tear. The last set I picked up was under $220 CDN and has lasted now 4 years.

* For shirts:White is best for Frugality - It can be bleached if needed, and no-one notices when you wear white 3 days in a row. They seem to last longer than any patterned shirts I own. For shopping I have found good luck with stores like Winners (TK-Maxx equivalent in Canada), Costco, Ordering Online and when the big sales are on, the best shirt for the money (again Canada) is at the Hudson Bay, their Hudson Room (store brand) the egyptian cotton shirt goes on-sale a few times a year and you can picked them up for under $40, outperforms the $200 designer shirts any day of the week. I love some of the new blends compared to some poor quality cotton, most blends will press easier, resist staining and are cheaper.

* Ties: Dark is Best - Smooth is best, try to keep them under $15-20, again from the above sources.

**Maintenance:**
 
* I only dry clean my suits every 6 months, it is the care after it comes off your body that can make or break your budget. They go to the cleaners when after many home cleanings I notice a bit of a sheen forming.

* Every day when you take off your suit, put the jacket on a hanger and place the trousers on the clamp style hanger, (the type that you clamp the bottom and the whole pant hangs down with no fold). This will ensure you are never having to press your trousers between cleans. Do not wear the garment for at least a day, it will allow for any creases to fall out on their own. Invest in a good umbrella and overcoat, keep your suit dry, you will not get the puckering at the seams.

* Depending on the season, either weekly or every-two-weeks I will freshen the suits with Dryel (Walmart sells &lt;$11 for a 6 pack). Dryel works by 'steaming' the clothes in a nylon bag, leaves a light scent and removes 99% of the stains I have thrown towards it. I will steam no-more than two garments at a time (instructions say you can do 4). Before steaming I will use the dryel sheet and go over any stains I notice to pre-treat.

*Pressing on the Cheap* - If your trousers are losing their crisp press do this: find a good steam iron, ironing board WITH Metallic Cover (to reflect the heat/steam towards the bottom of the material), and a thin piece of linen (I use an old linen napkin).

* Align your trousers so that when you press your crease is where you want it and drape the two legs of the trousers perpendicular to the ironing board. (You will work in short sections, I find this keeps the crease continuous and straight). Now put the cloth napkin over the area you will press and iron as normal. The cloth absorbs any oils/ stains and it ensures you do not burn or sheen the material.

* Shirts: Nothing too new hear, just a way to press your shirt in under 2 minutes. Wash per manufacturers instructions, depending on material hang immediately on a non-metallic hanger (no rust stains), or dry and hang immediately. When pressing, take one side of the shirt and drape it over the ironing board so that the buttons are on one edge and the other half of the shirt is hanging over. We are going to press front and back together. (I keep things aligned by pinching right under the armpit and at the base of the shirt then drape). Before using the iron quickly flatten out any wrinkles that will form on the back of the shirt. Press with steam and go. Same approach for the sleeves, Finish the collar and you are in business. I can do 10 shirts in around 20 minutes.

**EDIT for Clarification: I basically Iron my shirt in 5 parts: a) Collar b) left half of shirt (front and back at the same time) c) right half of shirt d) left sleeve e) right sleeve. The big difference from how I see most people iron is that I do front and back at the same time to save time.**

**EDIT2: [Video of ironing shirt in under 1:30 on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7PP2MbrofU)**

* Ties: Fold or hang immediately after it comes off your neck. Cost analysis for me says I wear them until they are stained and then give to charity. Cost for me to get them dry cleaned local is around the same as a new tie. I heard Dryel works well, never tried as I rarely soil my ties.

I will dedicate 20 minutes a week to my clothes, against a old cost of around $60 a week and a trip to the cleaners.

1326084157.0,527,self.Frugal,o8w12,My Great-Grandma's homemade bread for pennies per loaf. ,758,231,222,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/o8w12/my_greatgrandmas_homemade_bread_for_pennies_per/,"I thought I should share this with you guys. I've been making bread for several years now, and I started with this white-bread recipe passed down from my great-grandma. Apparently she sold this during the depression for some extra cash. It's the best white bread I've ever had and can be modified into so many useful things. One batch also makes 7 loaves (one for each day of the week supposedly), which freeze excellently in just re-used shopping bags. I buy the flour from Sam's for 7.50/25 lbs, the yeast from sams for about 5 bucks/2lbs, and just store-brand sugar and vegetable shortening.  Here's the basic recipe:

1. In a small bowl mix: 1/2 cup warm (~115 degree F) water, 1 teaspoon sugar, and 2 tablespoons (or packets) of yeast.
Stir these together, cover, and let sit 5 mins for the yeast to activate.

2. In a (very) big bowl mix: 7 cups warm water, 1.25 cups sugar, 2.5 tablespoons salt, and 4 tablespoons vegetable shortening.

3. Add 5 cups of flour to the big bowl and mix

4. Add 5 more cups of flour to the big bowl and mix

5. Add the activated yeast to the big bowl and mix

6. Add 5 more cups of flour to the bowl and mix

7. Add 2-5 final cups of flour to make a dough that is firm but still a little sticky. 

8. Dump the dough onto a floured surface and knead a few minutes. Don't add too much flour here, just enough that the dough is kneadable, but still sticky. 

9. Wash out the big bowl, grease with shortening (or anything really) and place the dough in the bowl. Keep in a warm place for one hour. To do this I usually warm my oven up for a few mins, then shut it off right before I put the dough in. 
[Here's what it looks like before rising.](http://i.imgur.com/TiZOB.jpg)
[And here's what it looks like after the first rise.](http://i.imgur.com/7ujS2.jpg)

10. Take dough out, punch it down, roll out on a floured surface, and knead 4-5 more times, then place back in bowl and let sit another hour in a warm place. 
[This is after the second rise](http://i.imgur.com/NIqcy.jpg)

11. Take dough out and fill 6 to 7 5x9 inch bread pans that were pre-greased. The recipe usually makes 7 loaves, but depending on how well it raised or just how well I am at dividing sometimes I get 6.5 like you see in the pictures. 
[In the pans pre-final rise](http://i.imgur.com/odYDN.jpg)

12. Raise in a warm place a final hour. 

13. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 mins until golden brown. 

14. Dump out the bread from the pans, let cool, then bag in old grocery bags. Freeze if you would like. [Enjoy the final product!](http://i.imgur.com/fp5Wy.jpg)

Edit: As a side note, working with dough gets easier with practice. My first loaves were always a little flat (but still delicious), but as I made more loaves I got a better feel for what the dough should feel like and some intricacies like how you need more flour when it's humid (since dough absorbs water in humid weather) than when it's cold. 

Edit2: You can also freeze the dough at the point where you would've put it in the pans to save for other projects. I've used a 1 loaf equivalent from this recipe to make calzones, homemade pizza pockets, and cinnamon roles.

Our monthly food budget (family of four) has gone from close to $700 a month to just under  $300 last month.  Our electric bill has been reduced by half.  We have used the money that has been saved to make extra payments on the principal on our mortgage.  As of March, we will have paid off our 30 year mortgage 26 years early.  Thank you for all of the tips.

**Edit**
I really did not expect that much interest in my little post.  I was just trying to say thank you for the tips I picked up along the way.  I am going to try to answer a few of the questions that keep popping up.  

First off, my family learned to watch our spending early on.  As a young military family you have to learn to budget and stay away from those that prey on that guaranteed paycheck.  ""All military credit applications approved.""  In the beginning we had a base pay of just over 1k a month.  Add BAS to that and we made about $1500 each month.  We lived on post so we did not have to pay power, water, rent.  It was horrible housing that has since been torn down.  As we moved up the ladder, pay went up, spending went up, and our credit rating went up.  So we spent more, and the pay went up.... you see how this goes.   

When the time came to move our family past the military, we started planning in advance.  While deployed we stuck to the pre-deployment budget and banked all of the hazard pay.  Since we were not use to having that money anyways, we didn't miss it.  We also started to explore what area of the country we wanted to move to when the DD-214 was in hand.  We looked at housing costs, average income, cost of living.  Having both lived in the northern US at one point we knew to cross that off the list right away.  We decided to move back to our favorite post in the southern US.  

Tips that helped the most:
1.  Ditch the dryer and use a clothes line.  
2.  Turn the heater down and put on more clothes.
3.  A phone is meant for making calls, not texting and surfing the web.  Data is a waste of money.
4.  Only a handful of people have my cell number.  Call me at home.  Unlimited talk is a waste of money.
5.  An Iwhat?  No thanks.
6.  Windows what?  No thanks.  
7.  Cut the cord.  I don't like watching QVC anyways.  Locals are HD over the air.  If you wait 24 hrs you can watch everything else for free.  
                   note.... we do like our NFL.  That was my xmas gift from my husband.  A VPN and a subscription  NFL Gamepass.
8.  Turn off lights.  Unplug items when not in use.  
9.  Hey kid, hot water costs money and we would all like to use some.  Get out of the shower already.
10.  Take what you want but eat what you take.

Working out a Budget (my way)
1.  Take a really hard look at where your money is going every month.  Be honest with yourself.
2.  Round down for what you have and round up for what you owe on each budget you make.  This leaves room for fluctuation.
3.  Every new check means a new budget.  Examine where the money went again.  Can you cut any of those costs?
4.  Stagger your bills so that they don't all come in at the same time.  Try to split the average monthly revolving cost evenly between checks.
5.  Not due until the first, too bad.  Pay it before it is due.  You never know when a troll will eat your check in the mail.  Late charges are a waste of money.
6.  More pay means more to save, not to spend.  You lived on less in the past.  Others live on less because they have to.
7.  Set goals.  When goal is reached, set a new goal.
8.  There is no I in team.  Your spouse and children are in this with you.  It only takes one person to throw a budget out of line and miss a goal.  
9.  Give yourself an allowance for the ""little things.""  Take that money out in cash for each period.  When it is gone you are SOL.
10.  Balance your checkbook.  If you bounce a check then you did something wrong.  Fix yourself and don't do it again.  Bounced check fees are a waste of money.  Overdraft fees are a waste of money.


I have some things to get done but I will try to answer more of the questions individually a little later.

Here are some of mine-  

* **Separate bank accounts/cards** to limit and better budget spending eg ""Essentials"", ""Fun Money"", ""Reserve Account""  

* **Sales** - Not buying just because something is on sale, however bulk buying when an essential is eg washing up sponges or cat food. If a sale is encouraging you to buy something you wouldn't normally then pause for a moment, use a ""buyer's delay"" like waiting a week.  
* **Value** - To assess a product/service's value I compare it to a similar outgoing, for instance I would think ""That is as much as my internet bill each month"".  
* **Use** - If I find I use something a lot, I investigate and research a BIFL (Buy it For Life) alternative. If I don't use something that was a substantial outgoing, I learn from that and keep it in mind next time I am in a similar purchasing scenario.  
* **Emotional Money** - I find that many people connect money/spending to a strong emotional hook or feeling. This can be helpful but often is harmful. It's good to investigate and to become aware of such mechanisms inside you, either through discussion or meditation or similar.  
  
I'd love to hear yours, share the frugality.

Sorry. Also, this could be posted to /r/relationship_advice but I was more interested into knowing how people manage to have a more frugal / early retirement money managing plan with their SO. This thread received way too much attention. I can't answer all the comments, but thanks to everyone who posted helpful advices.

So here's our situation : We bought a (somewhat cheap) condo this year since rent is quite pricey in our area and we decided that if we could afford being owners it would be a better idea in the long term. It's being built right now and we plan on moving in either in December or January. 

I have been using Mint.com to track my expenses and do a budget for about 2 years and it have helped me a ton to get better at managing my money. I've started reading blogs (like Mr Money Mustache) and I want to retire early and live without spending like crazy (like I used to do).

The thing is, living with my girlfriend is difficult because she doesn't really care about her finances and never thinks before making a purchase. I made her sign up on Mint.com but she says she's scared to go look at it and see how bad her finances are. Whenever I bring up the subject of cutting on expanses and saving and not buying stuff we don't need, she just says ""but I/we absolutely need this"" and won't listen to me. **Edit** : Although she doesn't skip a single rent / utility bill, she doesn't tackle the credit card debt problem and it's usually just fluctuating a lot, she can't get her card down to 0 before making another big purchase.

Since we're a few months away from moving into our new condo, she keeps telling me we need to buy new furniture (even if we have all the furnitures and appliances we need already), and she wants beautiful/fancy stuff like a 300$ lamp, a 2000$ couch and a 1500$ bed frame just to name a few. 

I still have student debt and we both have credit card debts, she won't listen to me when I tell her we simply can't buy all of this.

1279243547.0,511,self.Frugal,cq4b6,Protips from a grocery store cashier,696,185,566,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/cq4b6/protips_from_a_grocery_store_cashier/,"If the sandwich meat is prepackaged (in that vacuum sealed plastic thing), don't buy it. Its cheaper, but thats because unsanitary shit happens in the back deli. Buy from those people that cut slices off a big hunk of meat.

Don't put mixed-priced things in one bag. The main offenders are sweet peppers - if green peppers are $0.99/lb, orange peppers are $1.99/lb and you put them in the same bag, I'm charging you $1.99/lb for the whole thing. Fuck you.

If things are lying on those slanty flat surfaces (lettuce for example), take the stuff thats near the back. Rotating stock means putting old produce at the front so it sells faster. Plus everyone touches it.

Get to know the produce guy. If he likes you, then when he sees you shopping for grapes he'll say ""what are you doing?"", tell you that the grapes are shit, go to the back room and cut you off the grapes from the newest shipment.

Don't buy shit out of season. It's more expensive, has been in a truck from California for days, and is pumped with preservatives/was picked green. Tastes nothing like the real thing.

If you're buying light stuff (chili peppers, mushrooms) and want to be cheap, don't bother putting them in plastic bags. Four chillies in a bag = $0.85; four chillies carried in your hand and put on the scale bag-free=$0.30. For someone who buys $0.99/lb apples instead of $1.49/lb apples, this is a much better strategy for saving money without compromising quality.

Bring your own bags. This should be obvious.

Buy onions in the biggest quantities you can eat before they go bad. If you're buying onions once a week, you're doing it wrong. They keep for months, are used in pretty much every dish, and unlike most other fruits/vegetables you're saving a ton of money when you buy them in bulk. A 10lb bag of onions is $5.99, while a 5lb is $3.99. 

Similarly, never buy those ""cuts"" of watermelons that are priced by weight. I've stopped so many people from buying $4 cuts of watermelons (about 1/4 of the melon) when they could buy the entire thing for $6. 

Stop buying shit out of season, seriously.

Feel free to look through those little pre-packaged plastic containers of berries and pick out the ones that are bad. Replace them with fresh berries from surrounding containers. Nobody's going to stop you.

Start underestimating how much a pound really is. At $5.99/lb, a few handfuls of cherries are gonna cost you $10. Nobody ever expects this. Wait until the season picks up and the stuff gets cheaper, or buy less. 

Bananas are the cheapest fruits. One banana costs, on average, $0.25. Remember this next time you're in a cafeteria or some other lunch-serving place that sells bananas for $0.99 each. 

Try to buy baskets of stuff instead of paying for each one separately. One kiwi is $0.33, a basket of roughly 30 kiwis is $2.99. Look through the basket and take out soft kiwis, replace them with better ones from other baskets, profit.

Don't buy asparagus unless they're displayed in water basins. The bottoms of asparagus should be submerged in water, they'll be fresher for longer. Your pee, however, will smell either way. 

Baby carrots are overpriced. All they are are cut up, peeled carrots in a plastic bag. For the same price, you can buy twice the amount of normal carrots, peel and cut them up yourself. 

For the love of God, grapefruits taste terrible in july. Learn the seasons and buy season-appropriate produce.

(Story),701,197,194,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/d4e71/so_today_being_frugal_for_the_past_three_years/,"TL;DR: Both our cars broke down within days of one another. Need $1,500+ to repair them both. But it's okay, because we lived within our means and saved.

Backstory: Wife and I racked up 30k of credit card debt while she was in college. We've been paying it down for three years. About 30% of our income went to savings/debt payoff. We're set to pay our last credit card bill this Sunday. At which point we only have a single car loan.

Current story: On Friday, my car was running very hot (dangerously). We took it to a mechanic we trust, he told us it'd be about a grand. 

My wife was out of state on business with our other car. Apparently while out of state, she began having assorted issues with the brakes and steering. That'll be about $500. 

It sucks we had to drop $1,500 on car repairs on the same day. But I'm actually kind of happy. Two years ago this would have destroyed us financially. We would have had to go begging to relatives for money. 

But now, because we saved religiously and lived frugally it's just a couple clicks to transfer money from our car savings account. And we'll still be able to pay off our last credit card in full this Sunday. And make our rent. 

So, shitty circumstances. But I'm happy that it's only a passing inconvenience and not a financial nuclear bomb.

Instead of tossing the ends of whatever vegetable you just cut up (e.g., carrot, celery, pepper, onion, zucchini), toss it in a gallon sized bag and stick in the freezer. Keep doing this 'til the bag is full. Dump in a pot, cover with water, bring to boil, simmer for an hour or so until preferred strength is achieved. Drain the veggies out, and freeze the broth! I usually freeze some in an ice cube tray as well in order to have small amounts to add to sauces or reheated soup that needs a little thinning.

Experiment with different herbs during the process; oregano, sage, or bay is good. Same goes for different veggies. Mushrooms add meaty undertones, potatoes are good, honestly whatever you have. Due to spicy peppers, my broth always has a subtle heat to it.

1319070279.0,492,self.Frugal,li44u,Focus on housing first. Don't worry about saving money on shaving blades and other tiny items if you want to save real cash.,750,258,341,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/li44u/focus_on_housing_first_dont_worry_about_saving/,"When you think about what you spend on, the most important factor is cost/day. Even a $3000 set of furniture will cost you under a $1/day if you can keep it for 10 years.

On the other hand, rent/mortgage is probably the highest you will pay in terms of cost/day. Even a $1200/month in a reasonably large city is $40 a day. A $12000 car is just above $3 a day if you can keep it for 10 years (not counting maintenance)

All your savings on razor blades, coffees, etc. probably don't amount to $1/day (unless you are really hairy).

The smart thing then, is to focus first on housing. If you can save $100 by being in a cheaper apartment, that's $3/day. You can probably shave, occasionally drink coffee or eat at a restaurant, thus vastly improving your lifestyle by making that one change. This is not an easy option for folks with kids since you may need to be in a certain neighborhood for school district and safety.

Do not buy a house that's too large for you or with a huge mortgage. Most people do move in under 7 years and you have mostly paid interest. A large chunk of your principal will still stay with you.

Also do not buy a house too large for you. The temptation to fill it with crap will be too high. And if you lose your job, you will end up losing your savings (to pay mortgage), your home (when its foreclosed) and your credit history. Its far simpler to rent and move in with family or friends during extended periods of unemployment. At least you will have savings and wont ruin your credit. 

However, folks who have significant savings and are certain they will not move (or cannot move due to various reasons) can sink their savings in a home in a soft market (such as now). This only makes sense if your mortgage payment is much lower than your rent -- to hedge against real estate devaluation. It also means you can rent it out at a positive cash flow if you need to move.

Next, focus on your car. If you can live in a city with good transportation close to work (bicycling is best), you get exercise plus save on gas and a car. Again, this may not be an option if you have kids, but at least you can cut down on the second car.

Whatever you do, cut food and medical care at the very end. These are essential for your well being and eating a nutritious meal for $4 more a day is vastly better than eating Ramen noodles everyday.

1326304630.0,492,self.Frugal,oclrk,My frugal college student bodybuilding diet grocery list. (Or just a general way to eat healthy!),776,284,366,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/oclrk/my_frugal_college_student_bodybuilding_diet/,"Hey guys, thanks for reading. I thought I would share a nice grocery list with you all that I have had a lot of success with losing weight and putting on muscle with. I work out a lot, 3-4 days most weeks, but this diet is a general way to eat healthy and not spend a lot of money. I will start with the essentials and then I will list optional items that help with muscle building. I wont list specific brands, you can usually find discounts on any website when ordering supplements like protein and get some good deals. Afterwards I will list what my meals look like for the day/week.

Essentials:

Eggs. (Lots of eggs!)
Nonfat milk.
Asparagus.
Broccoli.
Yams. (or regular potatoes!)
Big tub of regular oats. (Oatmeal)
Chicken breasts. (Buy bulk - Separate into ziplock bags in freezer)
Beef. (80/20.. or 93/7)
Spinach.
Tomatoes.
Peanut butter.

Optional items (Highly recommended for exercising / meal replacement.)

Whey protein.
Casein protein.
Multi vitamins.
Green tea.
Onions / Bell peppers / Jalapenos / garlic (Etc.. your favorite sides)


What an average day looks like in terms of meals for me (Keep in mind I am 6'1'' 215 lbs and can eat like a horse, so you may adjust):

Meal1: 3 eggs.
Meal2: Whey protein shake (immediately after workout)
Meal3: Chicken breast or beef with boiled asparagus and broccoli.
Meal4: Casein protein shake with a scoop of peanut butter, and 2 scoops of oatmeal made with nonfat milk. This is a very filling shake and very healthy for you.

In general that is what my M-F looks like, preparing meals ahead of time at home to take to school / work has worked well for me. Most of the items I listed can be bought in bulk and I feel the diet is very healthy without really impacting my wallet on a meager income. Most of the ingredients can be cooked in very creative ways as well. Spice it up!

When dieting hard like this, it is very important you take a cheat day! So, if you do decide to follow something like this, remember to indulge whenever it is available to you (only 1 or 2 days a week though!)

General things, whey and casein proteins that you can purchase have tons of vitamins and amino acids your body needs and can generally serve as a meal replacement (think slimfast shakes) but are much more economical when bought in 5-20lbs worth of protein. One large tub lasts a VERY long time if you only drink one a day. Of course when supplementing protein keep in mind you should work out! Green tea is great for a diet like this, well caffeine in general is because it speeds up metabolism, but green tea is just nice to have now and then.

I hope my little grocery list helps out. I would love some feedback or I would also answer any questions you have about routines in diet on a budget. Thanks again for reading have a nice day.

As most people here I assume, we're bargain shoppers. We don't buy in excess, but we do buy in bulk. Use and re-use.

So the problem I'm having is this: We've been living in a rented apartment for the past 6 years. We don't worry about house maintenance, lawn care, etc all the stuff that comes with owning a home. We don't even own a lawnmower. We're going into this with absolutely nothing.

So if you own a home, how did you do it? I have a really bad feeling we're going to move in, and have to blow our savings, which we worked so hard to get where it is. I want a cushion in case something goes wrong, which I'm sure it will, but I still feel that just hemorrhaging money at things we'll need is not the way to go.

Any insight on how to keep staying frugal for a BRAND NEW homeowner?


Edit: Thanks for the suggestions everyone. Here's what I am taking away from this:

-Buy quality tools, even if they are a little more expensive up front. 

-One project at a time. Don't start 40 different things because they will never get done. 

-Property walk throughs at set intervals to determine maintenance needs. 

-Lists, lists, lists

-YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE

-BREATHE

-CALM DOWN IT WILL BE OKAY

Second off: mobile post, sorry about formatting* (*Edit: Finally got around to formatting properly)


Since I stumbled upon r/frugal, I have gotten a lot better with my finances. When I first came across you guys, I just moved into my first apartment, with my boyfriend. We liked the area, and the price was right. As well as we were taking over the lease for his elderly father so it worked out well. 


We bought a couch with our tax return instead of paying off my visa. Mistake mistake. But... We do love the couch and have since smartened up. 


We both work minimum wage, but I'm a cook, and took over the meal planning/budget. You guys suggested Costco. Best choice ever. Large cuts of meat and small prices. I already knew how to break down meat into portions, but a quick YouTube video taught my boyfriend. 

Toilet paper and frozen fruit are also dirt cheap here. Fresh produce isn't worth it unless you have a mormon sized family. The muffins freeze well, but can be made cheaper at home, also they mould super quickly if left unfrozen. 


Then I realize the apartment needed a good clean. You guys suggested vinegar and bleach (not together!). Well damn. Clean apartment for pennies :) 


I then started getting in the frugal mood. Finding ways to cut out dollars at a time. Laundry was our big change eater. $1.75 for a wash and $1.75x2 for a dry (the dryer is half the size and needs two runs). 
So I bought a drying rack. $10 and has saved us that within two weeks. 

I cut out paper towel, but then I realized I was washing dish cloths so much I was paying the same as I would for paper towel. 
Problem solved: bucket of 50/50 bleach/water under the sink. Cloths goes in there, after a week they get wrung out, rinsed out, and dried. No machines! No bacteria!


I started unplugging everything we didn't need plugged in 24/7. Unsure how much it saves. But it makes us think twice before using the microwave. I don't think I've used it in months. So that's a bonus. 


Cut the cord! No more Bell Aliant! Bought a desktop on sale and hooked it up to our living room tv. We stream, download and Netflix everything now. Also did the [American Netflix hack] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8uu7Y3ldKQ) (Canadian Netflix is sorta lame.) Sold our old laptops and his xbox360. We were paying $200 a month for tv before, and didn't enjoy it. Now we have shows we follow, more free time as no commercials and more gaming power! WoW runs ultra smooth. 
$800 desktop found it on sale, (2TB memory, 16 Gig ram), sold laptops for $300, Xbox for $150. And no more Bell. Good choice. Also no more commercials means no more in your face product pressure.


We got a kitten. Called around and found the cheapest vet, and started volunteering at the SPCA to receive more discounts. Also started fostering kittens, it's free, they pay for food and litter, and this way we didn't have to buy a second cat as a companion for our terribly hyper kitten. Win win. 
Since we started fostering she has calmed down, learned how hard she bites, and doesn't bite or claw during play anymore. I guess she was just socially awkward.


Next up was to issue the flow of money. We were poor every week after paycheck and couldn't figure out why. I built a spreadsheet and now we have $500 a month to pay off debt. Meaning come the new year, we both will be debt free except for student loans. We will be using the snow ball effect though, so hopefully it won't take 12 years to pay off my student loan (as the government predicted). 


I was paying $260 a month in cabs, ridiculous. After asking you guys, the answer was clearly to buy a car. We found a used car at a lot, 5 years insurance and with a reputable company. While its a newer car and not as frugal as can be, it's amazing on gas ($60 a month - even cheaper than 1 of our bus passes) and we can keep it for a long time (room for baby seats...). It's a Nissan Versa 2011. 


I'm so grateful r/frugal. You have truly changed our lifestyles, and for the better. We have money to do what we want now, and stopped buying daily ""treats"" and started thinking long term. No more coffees and fast food! And snacks... My boyfriend was the worst for buying daily snacks at work. 


Now I make snacks that fit it a 1 cup mason jar. Jello, homemade pudding (cheaper than the packaged stuff!), applesauce, yogurt and fruit. Muffins in jars. Cookies. Whatever. It's easy for him to grab and it lasts in his bag all day (works security).


Edit: remembering some more tips as the week goes by. 

For me I have more time than money. And therefore I try to use that extra time to save money. I try not to be lazy. If I'm at the grocery store and I want a snack, I ask myself first ""Can I make it at home? Can I make it cheaper at home? Would it be fun to try?"" Usually the answer is ""yes yes and yes"". 

I've learned how to make pudding and bread (no machine), ice cream (no machine machine), homemade cookies and muffins and banana bread, homemade pasta sauce, pizza sauce, pizza dough I freeze (I make it, stretch it, freeze it, instant frozen pizza!) waffles that I freeze,  smoothies with discounted fruit, cat toys, grow my own herbs, make my own crackers. 
Seriously: invest in a Kitchen Aid. 


Today I'm going to try and make my own potato chips.

First of all I live in Canada. I just don't know what level of poverty justifies using a food bank because I don't want to take food from people who need it more than me. I was wondering if anyone else has had this experience and maybe if I explain my situation a little, some fellow Canadian out there will have a suggestion on what to do.

I just got a job but when I did the math I still have less than $40 a month for food. I am a 24 year old female. I just got a degree but I have no experience to get a job in my field and I can't afford an unpaid internship. As far as family resources, my dad was the primary breadwinner but died in an accident several years ago. My mom is injured and waiting a few months for surgery so she can't work let alone walk or drive. She has enough to support herself but I was forced to borrow money from her for the past few months while I was unemployed. She's going back into debt and I can't burden her anymore. I have a credit card that's over it's limit and I fear getting another will not help. I am still trying to get a second job but no luck yet. I have friends who would help me if they knew how poor I am right now, but they're all fresh graduates too and I don't want to burden anyone. I have to admit that I'm kind of ashamed of them finding out how much financial trouble I'm in right now. I used to use my university's food bank but I graduated several months ago. I have no idea how food banks work in the real world.

Honestly I just feel kind of ashamed to have to resort to this but I can't figure out other options. I'm a white female with a degree who comes from a family of educated middle class people. I feel like with everything life has given me already I should be able to support myself but I just can't get ahead...I'm not sure what I'm trying to accomplish with this post. I think I'm just coming to terms with the idea that I'm actually living in poverty. Anyway, if anyone else has gone through a time like this I think it would just be nice to hear how you got through it, if you used a food bank and what it was like. I'm sorry for the wall of text.

**TL;DR:** I'm a really poor Canadian and I'm considering going to a food bank. Just wondering if anyone else has done this and what it was like. 

**EDIT:** Wow! This was a much bigger response than I thought I was going to get. Thank you everyone for being so reassuring! I think hearing ""GO!"" from people who donate to food banks is making me feel a lot better about it. Thank you everyone for your encouragement and stories!

You should too!",654,182,168,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/15q3g7/attempting_a_no_spend_month_as_an_experiment_and/,"I've been seeing quite [a bit](http://smallnotebook.org/2012/07/01/no-spend-month-start-here/) of bloggers talking about having a [""No Spend Month""](http://freefrombroke.com/try-a-no-spend-month-your-wallet-will-thank-you/) starting tomorrow. This is slight misnomer, as you are just essentially zeroing out unnecessary expenditures the ENTIRE month and cutting back to bare bones on everything else.

This doesn't leave much time to plan if you intend to get on board in January, but you can start planning now for February.

January was the perfect month for us (two adults), since Christmas and Dating Anniversary just happened, an upcoming dip in pay from his job due to Holiday absence, and the fact it's really, really cold outside and will help keep us indoors on weekends.

The rules I'll be using (cobbled together from a few blogs as a guideline) are this:

* The Budget for No Spend Month does NOT include: Usual monthly bills or emergencies. 
It DOES include: any 'entertainment' (eating out, movies, clothing, soft drinks at the gas station, coffeeshop drinks, liquor/beer - anything that is not essential to existence basically), all grocery expenses and all gasoline. We've set ours at $300 for the month - our current monthly average of grocery and toiletry budget and very little extra. 

* Not attempting to beat the system by eating ramen or cheap junk food the whole month. We want as many filling, frugal and healthy meals as we can get. Our goal is MINIMAL non-healthy snack foods. I'll be relying on hummus and carrots and nuts heavily.

* Many blogs eschew 'stocking up' in advance - I admit I put $50 extra in grocery spending last week to assure we are well prepared with meats, beans, rice and other cheap but filling staples, as well as some spices we were running low on. We aren't giving ourselves the luxury of saying 'there's nothing here to eat, let's go out' and giving ourselves variety in our diet. I'm using this as an excuse to STICK to weekly meal planning, since I've been pretty lax on it this year - leading to seriously unnecessary impulse buys in the food department.

* Our chosen ways to use our free time: We will be taking full advantage of my yard sale boardgames collection and my Steam library. We'll exploit /r/BestOfStreamingVideo and its ilk. We'll invite friends over to our house for light but good meals and boardgames as well. I'm going to attempt improving my homemade bread making skills and pouring over my massive cookbook collection for new recipes. My SO will be crocheting and putting more time toward studying for college. No excuses to miss our daily workout routines.

* Start off with all ESSENTIAL daily drivers and other vehicles on a full tank of gas.

* Most blogs in encourage you to crack down on your spending the MOST in the first week, to give yourself more wiggle room later on in the month.

I'll admit, this will be a very challenging thing for us, especially with the cost of gas factored in. We really want to see how far we can push ourselves,  since we hope to purchase a new gaming computer for Christmas next year. Depending on the success of this month, we might have a couple more in 2013.

If you've tried this before, please report back! If you want to give it a try, let us know your outline for the month.

1. It is not necessary to buy new clothing for your child.  Thrift stores will work just fine.  They grow so fast, it is pointless to buy them new clothing.  
2.  New baby stollers, cribs, toys, ect.  All can be purchased at a thrift store for next to nothing.  Children will grow out of the infant strollers fast, and they will never complain that a toy is not ""new"" when they are 9 months old.
3. There is nothing wrong with using cloth reusable diapers.  Repeat.  There is nothing wrong with using cloth reusable diapers.  This is a major saver!  Diapers are very expensive, and can be environmentally detrimental.  My parents used cloth diapers with me, I turned out half-way decent.  
4. Generic baby formula is just fine, and costs about 1/2 of what brand name formula does.  The child will not know the difference, and will grow perfectly healthy.  
5.  Hiring a baby sitter is a waste of money in the long run.  Petco sells perfectly good dog kennels.  Buy a sturdy steel one, apply a good padlock, and you all can enjoy some much needed time away without hiring a babysitter.  My parents used a kennel with me, I turned out just fine.

I make 12k a year from working 20 hours a week at $11.50 an hour. I also get $470/month from DCFS because I got taken from my parents and I'm in college, so that helps a lot too. 

My boyfriend pays half of our rent/utilities/food/pet care. So, we each pay $680 for our basic joint living expenses.

Our food budget is $200/month. We get by with this very easily. We only shop at local grocery stores, and I'm a vegan so that cuts down A LOT on our bill (I noticed even when buying him only the cheapest meat, the meat takes up 1/3 of our bill.)

Our rent is $780/month for a one bedroom, but that comes with free gas and water. Can't really cut corners there because where we live isn't that great already. Any cheaper and I'm back in the ghetto.

I pay $80 in gas every month, and another $80 for car insurance. Car is paid off (97 camry)

Every pay check I put 3% in my 401k and 20% in savings. I've built up a good little chunk there by tossing any extra bits of cash I have into savings, which came in handy when that 97 Camry had to have $800 worth of repairs done last week.

How I save money?

I feel like we get by a lot easier than most mostly because of two things.

1. Our grocery budget is low because we know how to cook and don't have expensive tastes.

2. We're massive nerds that get anxiety from going out too much. There are so many free hobbies to have, no point in spending loads of cash at the bar. 

I'm currently in college, so even though my loans are in deferment I'm still paying $25/month, just so the interest doesn't compound and so that it does take away that little bit of principle.

- calculate what percentage of that income is used just for living, e.g., rent, groceries, insurance
- whatever you have left is the money you can choose to spend however you want

It's not much, is it? All of a sudden, your hard work only results in a small amount of spending money. So, next time you think about buying something non-essential, convert it into how long you would have to work for the *spending money*

Here's an example:

Say I earn **3000** after-tax income per month. 
Daily income is approximately **$143** (3000 / 21 work days)
Hourly income is **$17.80**

Some approaches to spending stop here and say if you're going to spend money, think of it like work hours at a rate of $17.80. I don't think that's entirely right, because a big portion of that is just to get you by .. it's just 'living' money, not spending money. 

I earn 3000 but of that, 2300 goes towards rent, groceries, pet food, nappies, fuel.. etc. And about **$700** is for savings, and fun &amp; disposable spending. $700 is about 24% of $3000. 

The final step is to find 24% of my hourly rate of $17.80 = **$4.20  per hour**

So say I want to go out with friends this weekend and budget $100 for drinking, food and cabs. I can think about that as $17.80 per hour, but that's eating into my living money. I should be thinking about it at $4.20 an hour.. which is over 20 hours of work. All of a sudden, having a few drinks at home first seems like a great idea, and limiting the ones we have out and about. Not to mention sharing cabs etc. Maybe we can bring it down to a $50 evening and I've just saved 10 hours of work in terms of my spending money. 

**TL;DR - Think about spending in terms of work hours instead of money, but with a twist. Use the number of work hours it takes to earn *spending* money (funds outside living expenses).**

friendly cat litter around!",659,201,178,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/13q0ma/introducing_the_cheapest_and_most_environmentally/,"After I saw the Black Friday deal where the guy bought 10 buckets of cat litter, I realized that a lot of people are wasting money on litter without even realizing it. There are two major problems with traditional clumping cat litter:

1. Cat litter is strip-mined, which is awful for the environment.

2. It's fucking expensive!


Frugal, there is a better alternative: [wood pellets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_pellet)! Wood pellets are made from waste sawdust that has been tightly compressed into small pellets. They are mainly used for pellet stoves, and are sold for around $5 for a 50 pound bag at your local Tractor Supply Co or furnace shop. One bag lasts my 2 cats 2 months! They are also sold in pet stores, at 10x the price (don't waste your money). 

It's also flushable, if you're training your cat to use the toilet. It has very little smell, up close it smells vaguely of wood, but it covers up cat box odor like magic, so if you switch your litter box area won't stink like cat litter anymore. One of my cats is extremely picky about litterbox cleanliness, and she's become so much more relaxed now that we've switched. 


How to use it: Unlike clumping cat litter, wood pellets disintegrate when exposed to cat urine. The easiest way to handle this is a sifting litter box. Shake it a bit, and the dirty sawdust particles fall right through. Another way is to get a scoop without holes like the kind that are used to scoop bulk foods, and scoop up the sawdust particles.

1291428203.0,450,self.Frugal,efxps,Starbucks Hacks,666,216,332,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/efxps/starbucks_hacks/,"Now, I know as a rule frugal people don't buy Starbucks drinks. But say you're in a hurry and you need a caffeine fix, or you're a tea junkie like me and couldn't wait for your kettle to boil some water before your class/work/whatever. Or maybe your with some friends who all want to go to Starbucks (Because, say what you will about Starbucks, but if you want a place to hang out with your friends other than your house, Starbucks is much cheaper than a restaurant or bar), how can you save money?

I've worked at Starbucks a long time now, and there's a few things you can do to hack the system. 

Brewed coffee is cheap enough. Ask for a pour over of their bold coffee for a fresher cup. It takes a few minuets, but it's fresher and costs the same amount. Also, if you and several of your friends all want coffee, ask for a French Press. It's around 4 dollars and is approximately 45 oz of fresh, hot, French pressed coffee. *And* you can pick whichever blend you'd like. 

If you want espresso, avoid the options already on the menu board. Americanos cost just a little more than a cup of brewed coffee, but packs more of a caffeine punch because it's espresso and hot water. It tastes like coffee and you can sweeten it just like you would your normal cup of coffee. More bang for your buck. If you want an extra shot, don't ask for one. Ask for a ""grande Americano in a tall cup"". That way, they charge you an extra 30 cents, instead of an extra 70 cents for the shot of espresso. This works because Grande Americanos get three shots. Same would work for a Venti. My manager tells all his partners to do this by default, whether the customer asks for it that way or not, but other stores may not be so nice. 

If you like iced drinks, asking for a triple espresso in a Venti cup over ice, and then filling it with milk after the fact at the condiment bar is a great way to get an iced latte for about 2 dollars. Even adding a flavor (which is 40 cents extra) still saves you about 50%. Unfortunately, there's no real way to do this with hot lattes, as you need a barista to steam the milk for you. 

If you and a friend are out and want a Frappuccino, ask for a Venti split into two tall cups. Iced venti cups are 24 oz. Tall are 12. Viola. Two talls would cost you about 6 bucks, a venti, 4. 

If you are secretly a Starbucks junkie, there's a new loyalty program Starbucks came out with. You get a Starbucks gift card (Not credit), register it online, and pay with your card each time, reloading it as you go. You get a free drink (Any kind of drink, not matter how expensive) every 10 transactions or so. You get a free tall coffee with each purchase of a 1lb of coffee and a free tall drink of your choice for each 2lbs. You also get a free drink on your birthday. If you have one of these, and are getting drinks for multiple people, ring up each drink separately. 

Also, if you want a good coffee that is also quick and easy, Starbucks is pressuring their stores *profusely* to up their VIA sales. It's instant, water soluble coffee. No chemicals, no freeze drying. Actually quite good. I've used it when I'm staying in a hotel and it tastes just like coffee (Get the bold Italian Roast though, not the Colombian). A 12 pack of that stuff is $9.95. Not bad price per cup. And it dissolves in hot or cold water and even milk (.98 cent latte anyone?). It's a good gift for someone who works in an office with bad coffee or travels a lot. It's also wonderful in cooking. Act very skeptical and ask a lot of questions about it. If you don't get offered a free drink or some other deal with it within 2 minuets, I'd be very surprised. 

Also, if you buy Starbucks coffee in a grocery store, it will come with a coupon for a free tall cup of coffee. In actuality, the ring code works for any size. In addition to that, if you want a more expensive drink, we can take the price of a tall coffee off for you from the original price. Also, talk about how you're now out of coffee. The barista will most likely offer you a pound of our coffee for the same price as the grocery store coffee (The grocery store coffee is a smaller bag and is around 7 dollars, the bags in retail stores are 1lb and cost about 9 or 10). They can also grind it custom for you. As a side note, you can get any of our coffees weighed out. You can buy a full 1lb, a 1/2lb and a 1/4lb. 

Also, make friends with a barista. They will most likely hook you up with free drinks a lot. Further more, if you get to be really good friends, Starbucks baristas get a weekly coffee/tea/VIA markout. My boyfriend's parents and my parents never have to buy coffee because I get it for free. Furthermore, we get partner shopping days around the holidays, 40% off everything. Starbucks is a great place to get presents for those people you don't know very well (distant co-workers, secret santas, teachers, etc) and you can save a lot of money by asking a barista you know to buy it for you. 

Also, you get 10 cents off your drink if you bring in your own cup/use one of ours. 

Let me just say, that a lot of people don't understand why Starbucks drinks are so expensive. We *hand-make everything*. Well, not everything, but most of it. We make our own whipped cream, the Frappuccinos are hand made with real coffee and milk, teas are full leaf, the mocha is made fresh everyday and the Chai concentrate is all natural. You can get whatever drink you can possibly think of. Our pasteries are now made without HFCS, artificial colors, or preservatives. Our coffees are sourced ethically (Bucks pays a higher price for raw coffee than say, Folgers or DD and all of the espresso and brewed coffee in European stores are certified Fair Trade), and, further more, they treat their employees well. That's not say we get paid well or that there isn't bullshit politics, but every barista, part time or full, is given cheap health coverage, 401k, stock options, savings plans, tuition reimbursement, etc, etc. Last year each partner was given a stock grant, and this year we're each getting a bonus and generous matches on our 401ks because of Starbucks' success in pulling out of the recession pretty damn well. Furthermore, baristas are specially trained and certified. Yes, not all of them are worth a shit, but we're not simply counter-help. We learn how to properly froth milk, how to discern different flavor notes in a coffee, etc. Ask someone at DD what the difference between a coffee grown in Latin America as opposed to Indonesia, and they'll look at you like you have two heads. 

A good way to tell if a store is good or not is through two ways:

* Drive Thrus. Many drive thru stores are not as good as a cafe-only store. But say that a drive-thru store also has...

* Newer espresso machines. The older ones have the separate hoppers for the decaf and espresso beans and have two metal steam wands. The newer ones have a retro look to them, with pink enamel on the back and a flying-saucer looking hopper on top. The stores with these machines make more money, and therefore probably have better management/better staff. Also, the espresso is better from these machines, as the shots are timed with each pour, so the barista can better maintain the quality of the pour. The old machines had to be timed and calibrated every four hours or so, and, a lot of times, that just doesn't get done.

* However, unlike the new machines, the old machines can only pour two shots at a time. That means if you get a Grande Americano with three shots, will have a fourth one going down the drain, unless you ask the barista nicely if they could throw it in for you. Sometimes, if you're friendly from the get go, the barista will just do it anyways. And viola! Free shot.  

ALSO. Not that I would believe any of you to be guilty of this, but if you're bitchy to a barista, you're possibility of them 'accidentally' giving you decaf just went up about 70%. By the same token, complimenting the barista on bar on the quality of your drink will pretty much be the highlight of their day. I can say from experience, a man once said to me ""You're so smart [sip] and you make a damn good cappuccino,"" the cappuccino part was the one that stayed with me. 

Hope this helps you save a bit! Happy coffee drinking!

EDIT: 
Finally, if you come in and ask for a cup of coffee and see that the little red light on the brewer is blinking, ask politely for a fresher batch, or just go with a pour over. The red light starts blinking after an hour. At my store, we're pretty strict about the 30 minute time limit on our coffees, but other stores aren't. 

Lastly, if you come in and act like you're in a huge hurry and don't want to wait for a decaf or bold pour over, but are still nice enough about it, we'll make you an Americano for the same price as a coffee and get you out of there quick.",,False,,t5_2qhbe,True,,,True,t3_efxps,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/efxps/starbucks_hacks/,

Spray a section of the floor, let it sit for a few seconds, then mop. Once one side of the cloth is dirty, I take it off and flip it over to use the clean side. Then, once all my cloths are used up (about two cloths for the whole house), they just go in the washing machine. 

The vinegar solution is what I use as my multipurpose cleaner all over the house (it works great). To make, fill a spray bottle about 3/4 full with white vinegar, the rest of the way with water, and add 2-3 drops of dish liquid (I use antibacterial dish liquid).

Anyway, I just want to share this with /r/frugal because I figure you guys will appreciate it.  I was on my way in to work last week.  I park several blocks from the office in a residential area where the parking is free.  

I get out of my pickup and walk about 10 feet down the sidewalk when I realize that a contracting company is doing some kind of upgrade to the apartment building on the corner.  There's a guy standing on the front lawn messing around with 6 brand new direct-vent wall furnace heaters (the kind that run on propane and/or LNG).  Sitting in a row next to the new heaters are 6 used heaters that have obviously just been removed from the building.  

They all look to be in perfectly good working order.  I stopped and asked the guy ""What are you going to do with those heaters you just pulled out?""  He said ""I don't know, why, do you want them?""  I said, ""I'll take them gladly, whatever you please just don't throw them out, that's my pickup right there, the grey one.  It's closer than any dumpster, so please put them in the bed of the truck rather than throwing them away.""

I had to get to the office, so I just went on my way.  Left work about 9 hours later, and my truck had 6 heaters sitting in the back, with a box of hardware, vent pipes, etc.

I put them up with an ad on craigslist since I heat my home in VT with firewood and I don't particularly need a gas heater, never mind 6 of them.

Sold the lot for $1200 cash.

That's it, end of story, happy day.

I received my Comcast bill and noticed a $55 additional mystery charge, doubling my bill which is usually just internet &amp; cable modem rental. I called Customer Service and was connected to Sandy.

Sandy explained that the charge wasn't actually supposed to be on the bill, but that she couldn't remove it. Despite the fact I had not yet been charged from auto-pay, Sandy assured me, she was unable to do anything to remove the charge. Instead, Comcast would steal $55 from me, then credit it back to me on my NEXT bill. I asked Sandy what Comcast had done to deserve a $55 interest free loan from me, but Sandy did not have an answer.

Then Sandy blew my mind.

To prevent Comcast from stealing from me in the future, Sandy explained, I could BUY A PLAN FROM COMCAST FOR $5/MONTH THAT WOULD PROTECT ME.

You read that correctly. Comcast stole $55 from me, then offered to sell me a ""protection"" plan for $5/month to ensure I didn't get stolen from again.

I asked to speak to a Next Level Sandy and the story had a slightly happy ending. The charge was removed, the protection racket plan was declined, and I was politely irate enough to get the ""don't leave us"" half-price internet for six months plan that's normally reserved for new customers. (TL;DRers: I don't actually meet Bill Murray in this story, but you're almost done, so you mise well read the last paragraph).

The moral of the story is: if you call Comcast and threaten to switch carriers right now, you may be given half price internet in an effort to keep you with them. That's a savings of a few hundred a year.

TL;DR: Comcast tried to screw me, but then I got to meet Bill Murray. It was awesome, you should just read the whole thing.",,False,,t5_2qhbe,False,,,True,t3_ykize,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/ykize/just_a_reminder_comcastxfinity_is_a_legal_mafia/,

Yet when it’s time for routine maintenance on an electric dryer, most people throw their hands up and purchase a new one. Somehow the electric dryer has become disposable, much like a toaster. Not all dryers are created equal however, and some deserve a chance at a second life

**What kind of dryer should you buy?**

Whirlpool-made electric or gas dryers, are without a doubt, the best value in dryers for three simple reasons.

**1. Initial Cost.** They are close to, if not the least expensive dryers on the market, and they dry clothes just as well as the other brands and designs.

**2. Ongoing Costs.** They require the least amount of maintenance. All dryers are going to need maintenance in proportion to their use, much like cars. Whirlpool-made dryers however, typically require the least amount maintenance, I believe because of superior design factors.

**3. Repair Costs.** They are the cheapest and easiest to repair. The cost of a replacement part runs from just under $2 to about $30. The average price to repair a Whirlpool dryer is less than $10. I’ve repaired hundreds of them. All of the repairs can be done within 15-30 minutes by someone reasonably handy. There are videos on YouTube that walk you through every repair.

**Again, Whirlpool makes the following traditional dryers:**
Kenmore (don’t buy these particular [stackable Kenmore dryers](http://i.imgur.com/ukmUr5s.jpg), as they are made by Frigidaire)
Whirlpool
Roper
Estate
Inglis
Kirkland
Kitchen Aid
Whirlpool now owns Maytag and Amana as well, but only models a few years old. Be careful.

**Why you shouldn’t buy other brands?**

Because most of them are junk. They weren’t designed very well and they break down quicker. When they break down, they are much more expensive to fix and much more difficult to work on. Like I said in the How to Buy a Used Washing Machine post, most used appliance stores and repairmen just scrap the other brands.

**Should you purchase a gas or electric dryer?**

Right now natural gas is really cheap and if you already have a gas setup in your house, by all means use it. Gas dryers dry your clothes a little quicker than electric dryers as they produce more heat. Also, gas dryers are significantly cheaper than electric dryers on the used market, primarily because of less demand.

**How much should you pay for a used dryer?**

Expect to pay $50 to $150 for a used dryer. Dryer power cords can cost $20-$30, so save your old one if you are getting rid of it, or try to buy your dryer from someone that can give you the correct power cord for no extra charge.

**What to watch out for when buying a used dryer**

If you hear a whiny, screechy sound when the dryer is starting up, walk away. It’s the motor going out and that is one part that usually isn’t worth replacing, unless you repair appliances for a living. (even then, most repair places don’t swap motors out).

Don’t buy a dryer if the timer isn’t advancing. Timers, along with motors, usually aren’t worth replacing as they are very expensive.

It’s better to be able to see the dryer working before you purchase, if possible. This allows you to hear it operating, which will often reveal to you whether it needs any maintenance or not. Also, it shows that the previous owner was still able to use it themselves.

**What if you can’t test the dryer out?**

Take close notice of the person you are potentially buying from. Do they seem like they took care of it? Why are they selling it? Ask them if there are any issues with it at all and let them talk. In the end, you need to use your discernment and walk away if you don’t get a good feeling about the transaction. I always recommend trying to buy from the type of person you would have wanted to own the item before you.

**Should you buy a dryer with a digital display?**

Short answer, no. The digital control panels tend to break much more often than traditional non-digital panels. Maybe because of the constant vibrations and jostling that dryers receive, I don’t know. When they do go out, they are very expensive to repair.

**Frequently Asked Questions (will update)**

**Where is the best place to buy dryer parts?**

If you can wait a few days, then eBay. If you go to your local parts place and pay full retail, it will cost you 3-5 times more than you will find them on eBay.

**What about preventative maintenance?**

Clean your lint trap before each use. I recommend taking the back panel off your dryer every few years and vacuuming the lint, hair and dust from inside the dryer. You can also use an air compressor to blow everything out, making sure to blow out the heating element last. Also, after turning your dryer on, go check where the air exits the house and make sure the airflow is good and that there isn’t lint buildup at the exit. I’ve seen the exits completely clogged so that no air was able to escape. This will always cause destruction on the dryer as the dryer will overheat if the air is not able to vent properly.

**What kind of vent ducting is best?**

Solid ducting is better than the coiled ducting as it doesn’t clog up nearly as easily. Keep the distance for the air to make it outside as short as possible. The further the distance, the harder it is on the dryer to get all the moist air out of the dryer. If the distance is more than 12 feet, consider adding an in-line duct fan to assist in the removal of the air.

**Where should the exhaust tubing exit the house?**

The key here is that the air exits the house. Never exhaust a dryer inside a house as the moisture will only increase the chances of mold. Always vent out the side of the house if possible. Under the house only as a last resort, as it will just trap the moisture below the house, increasing the chance for mold to grow.

**How many kinds of dryer power cords are there?**

Four. Two different kinds of three prong, and two different kinds of four prong.


**What kind of power does a gas/electric dryer use?**

Gas dryers use 110 volt, so it will just plug right into a regular wall outlet and run fine. It won’t heat unless you have the gas hooked up (obviously) and turned on, but you can at least hear it spin and blow air.

Electric dryers use 220 volt (except for the very rare, small 110v dryers) You will almost never see these, and I would not recommend buying one. They take forever to dry your clothes. You would be better off using a clothesline.

**What about the really old Kenmore dryers?**

Don’t buy the model that only has one button. I think they are about 25-30 years old. Anyway, the motors on those things go out at an alarming rate if they are still hanging on. Still, I see them quite a bit and it’s a testament to the build quality of those old things.

The old brown/black panel Kenmore dryers are incredible. They were overbuilt, and I presume they will last until the end of time. If you are fortunate enough to have one of these beauty’s, repair it until the motor itself dies on you. (Which I don’t believe I’ve seen yet for those model’s)

**How long should you expect a dryer to last before it will need repairs?**

This is impossible to answer. There are too many variables, including how many loads per day, how big the loads are, how well the washing machine is getting water out etc. Then, there is no odometer to know how many loads have been done prior to you getting the dryer. Learn how to do some basic repairs, and expect maintenance to be occasionally needed.

**Is it worth it to pay for a warranty?**

I don’t think so. Most guys that offer a warranty on Craigslist only offer one for 30 days etc, but the cost increase far outweighs the very small chance that something will actually go out within that short of a period of time. The same goes for a store. You will pay at least an extra $100 purchasing a used dryer from a store, and will get about a 6 month warranty. I don’t think it’s worth it.

**How to transport a dryer?**

Dryers weigh about 100 lbs and can be transported upright or on their side. Try not to slide them across concrete or pavement too much as it will just bend the little plastic feet. Also, don’t pick the dryer up by the control panel, it’s just held on by some little plastic clips and a few screws.",,False,,t5_2qhbe,1362449111.0,,,True,t3_19nnlb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/19nnlb/how_to_save_money_buying_a_used_dryer/,
1358786072.0,433,self.Frugal,16ztis,frugality at the airport. ,531,98,233,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/16ztis/frugality_at_the_airport/,"We see a ton of ""frugal travel tips"" for when you get to your destination, but what about the time spent getting there? As a flight attendant, I see people spending way too much money on food and drinks at the airport. Having a delay just makes everything worse - even I give in to airport spending because I'm just so bored! Here are the tips I've come up with for travelers and crew members to try and save money. 

1. Bring your own reusable water bottle. Make sure it's empty when you go through security, and then fill it up at one of the many water fountains at the airport. Some, like O'hare, even have ""water bottle refilling"" water fountains, specific for water bottles. The water from these fountains is regulated and safe. I've been drinking the tap/water fountain water for years and I'm fine. Bringing your own water bottle will save you at least $3, possibly more if you have a long delay and drink a lot of water.  

2. If you're a big tea drinker, bring your own reusable mug and most places will fill it up with hot water for you. Just bring your own tea. Starbucks and Argo Tea have those stations where they put out  milk and sugars, so that's free too. (the tea on the plane is sub-par most of the time. you're better off bringing your own!) 

3. Bring your own snacks.  I've seen people eating their own pb&amp;j sandwiches on the plane. Trust me - I've eaten at almost every airport restaurant and **none of it is good** except for maybe Frontera (o'hare) and Heidi's (denver). Of course, if you do get delayed and run out of food you have no choice. Mcdonald's isn't too terrible if you get their ""healthy"" food (oatmeal, apple slices..haha) 

4. For those who like the extra leg-room, most airlines will charge you for these seats. However, if you do a little research the night before and you see that your flight is empty (you can usually check the seating on the airline's website) you may as well just stay in your coach seat and ask to move up once you get on the plane. Most of us will just be like ""oh, yea, sure"" 

5. Be nice to your flight attendants. We can make or break your flying experience! I had a pax (short for passenger) once who had to move 3-4 times because families were split up and he kept trying to help them sit together by moving. Every time he'd sit down, another split-up family would come and he'd move again. Finally, I was like ""listen, thanks for all of your help. You've moved like 5 times and i'm going to ask you to move your seat once more.. to first class"". It was a stressful situation for me because on that same flight I had a non-english speaking couple sitting in my exit row and we almost had to kick them off because they refused to move.. so any kindness was greatly appreciated. 

6. Almost every flight I come up with an abundance of newspapers. If you're flying and bored, ask your FA if they have anything to read! I would gladly give you your choice of whatever we have on board. This also goes for magazines and sometimes even books. People leave all kinds of stuff on our planes. 

Well, I hope this helps a little bit! It would be nice to see more people using their own waterbottles at the airport- the waste is just so ridiculous!

I never worked in my life - I quit school and my father was disabled until he died earlier this year, so I stayed home to help him out with everything. I inherited $15,000. I have a GED and took the SAT test in 2011, I am 20 years old right now.

I am currently staying with someone for free - I have no credit. What is the cheapest option for going to school? $15,000 won't last me more than a year if I am very frugal. I've wanted to go to school, but was put off while dealing with depression while caring for my father - he had paid for my sister's schooling, but through a divorce he had no money left, he couldn't help me, and I was in no real position to work. Now I can basically do whatever I want. 

My ultimate goal would be to end up in medical school. 

I already live an extremely minimal life:
* I spend no more than $35 for groceries per week, I cook everything on my own
* I don't eat out
* I don't use soaps or cosmetics, only shampoo, and I take 5 minute showers
* walk everywhere or take public transit
* everything I own fits in a backpack and a suitcase, nothing more
* I hand wash all my clothes in cold water I save in a bucket while I wait for water to get warmer for a shower - then I air dry
* I spend virtually nothing on entertainment, except for internet. I don't watch television, and I read free stuff I put on my kindle (wikipedia pdfs are nice)


I'm thinking I can actually live on $10,000 per year if I am careful. If I go to school, I want to be able to pay it off as quickly as possible, and reduce the costs as much as possible. I would rather work less and have more time for myself to think and study. The thing is, I am not entirely sure what to study. The first two years are mostly general classes, correct?

I am currently in Germany with my girlfriend (I am not in the military, no) - when I go back to the USA I have basically no good friends or family. My friends all turned into druggies - I want nothing to do with drugs, alcohol, or bad lifestyle. My family are all fundamentalist Christians while I am an atheist, it doesn't go well. They also support an unhealthy lifestyle. What are the average costs of something like a small studio apartment? I don't need anything really, but internet is a must (I think most places have wi-fi now, though). 

What is possibly the best state, cost wise, if there is one (regarding education)? I am from NY, but I do not want to go back to that sort of weather, cost of living, or people. In parts of upstate NY it is like the deep south. I cannot deal well with the low sunlight and snow in the winter, it aggravates my depression.



My options, I believe, are these:
Go back to the USA for 3 months, return to Germany and apply for ausbildungs. 
Go back to the USA and study for 2 years, then return to Germany and go to University
Go back to USA permanently and study, hoping my girlfriend might consider staying with me. 

Germany seems to be more stable than America right now - I could get a bachelors degree here for $2,000 USD as well, even as a foreigner. But I can't study here until I have an associates degree to equate to the abitur.

My wife and I would spend a couple hundred dollars per month on it by just eating once a week or so. We both love to cook, but sushi just looked far too specialized and intimidating to even try. 

That all changed when I watched an [episode of Good Eats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRdTq93XcVg) where Alton Brown shows mere mortals how to make sushi. Alton shows that sushi is actually fairly easy to make, and whats more it can be done very cheaply. Don't believe me? [Here's](http://imgur.com/SQZRp) my latest effort with about $10 of ingredients ($15 including wine). Where I live, 6 special rolls and 4 pieces of nigiri would set me back around $80, if we included a bottle of wine it would easily be $100 (plus tip). So a 90% savings!

The key to getting a low cost per roll is to be committed. I buy my ingredients somewhat in bulk from WalMart and Amazon, with the fish and veggies being the only items I buy the day-of at my local market.

What you'll need:

* Short-grained sushi rice. I bought 20lbs of mine for $17 at Walmart
* Nori (seaweed). Packs of 20 pre-cut sheets available at Walmart for $2.
* Rice Vinegar. Bottle is about $3 at local supermarket.
* Powdered Wasabi. Buy online for about $10/lb
* Sriracha. You should own this anyway, but it's $3 or so at Walmart
* Japanese mayo. Big bottle on Amazon for $10. It goes bad in about a month so I dumped half of the bottle into a vacuum-sealed bag and put in the coldest part of my fridge. The other half I combined in a half-full Sriracha bottle with a squeeze of lemon- voila, spicy mayo.
* Rolling mat. I happened to have bamboo placemats that worked better than the ""official"" mat, but if you want to buy one they're about $1 at Walmart. 
* Soy sauce. Don't get generic here- go for Kikkoman or another name brand. $5 for the big bottle at Walmart.
* Sesame seeds. Packets of these are 80 cents in the hispanic food section of walmart, compared to about $4 in the spice section. Stock up- they're really great on seared tuna.


So you're probably asking how this is frugal- I just listed $50 of ingredients and we haven't even gotten to the fish or veggies. The thing is, you use very little of each ingredient, so with each meal you make you're bringing your average cost down.

Ingredients for an 8-roll meal:

* 2 cups rice ($0.85)
* 8 pieces of nori ($0.80)
* 2 Tbsp Rice Vinegar ($0.25)
* 2 Tbsp sugar ($0.01)
* 1 Tbsp salt ($0.001)
* 3 Tbsp Wasabi Powder ($0.10)
* 8oz Sushi-grade Yellowfin Tuna ($4)
* 4oz Wild-Caught King Salmon ($3)
* 1/2 avocado ($0.50)
* 1/4 mango ($0.25)
* 1/2 cucumber ($0.25)
* Bottle of wine from Trader Joe's ($5)
* Cream cheese, sesame seeds, jalepeño, pineapple.. any ingredient you want to throw in can be used in very small quantities and cost next to nothing.

The prep time is admittedly somewhat long- about 45 minutes. That said, it's a lot of fun. If it's just the two of us, we'll keep trying to out-do each other with each roll we make. When we have company over it's a really fun activity, especially for people who have never done it.


EDIT- As notpandora pointed out- this is not something to ""get milage"" out of. Buy the fish you are going to use for that meal the same day, keep it chilled at all times (bring a cooler to the market with you if it's not next door to you), and eat it within an hour of it being out of the fridge. Raw fish is not something to mess with.

EDIT 2- I mentioned Walmart a few times, and I know that's not everyone's cup of tea (it's definitely not my favorite place), but this is /r/frugal and frankly it's the cheapest place I could find for the stuff that doesn't differ in quality from store to store. Their strength is packaged mass-produced goods, so I buy there when that's the case.

Incident #1) Verizon botched my bill. It was $190, and it should have been $90. This is a really obvious overage, but saved me $100 by just looking at the amount and picking up the phone for a 25 minute phone call.

Incident #2) National Grid sent out a bill for $93. I just moved, and this was their ESTIMATED amount. I called and they did an actual reading, in reality the bill was only $64. So there is another $29.

Incident #3) Went into a local CU to open an account. Was told by one of the reps that I have to open the revive checking account, a checking account with high costs that is designed for people who owe a financial institution money, because of a royal fuckup BOA made. 

I told them BOA is sending me a letter stating that the account is now in good standing and there is no money owed (I just got it sorted out last week, after a lot of hair-pulling and waiting- but that's a post for another time!). The woman at the CU was telling me that I'd have to open a checking account with a $10 a month fee, and deposit $162 I wouldn't get back for a year, effectively costing me a $120 for an account when their direct deposit checking accounts are free.. also, this revive account cost $6.00 each time you needed to reload their prepaid debt card, so there would have been those fees. Additionally, it would lose me a $100 incentive they give to account holders who have Direct Deposit. She said the letter from BOA wouldn't matter one bit. 

The minute I left the CU, I called their number and spoke with someone else, since this policy made no sense to me in light of the fact that I had done nothing wrong and would soon have proof of this. They told me what I had just been told was inaccurate- all I would need to do is bring in the letter stating that I did not owe BoA any money, and I could go on their normal checking account. This saved me at LEAST $220, and a lot of hassle and inconvenience.

1374372605.0,418,self.Frugal,1iq8yv,17 Uses for Alka-Seltzer!!,678,260,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1iq8yv/17_uses_for_alkaseltzer/,"1. Safely Unclog A Drain
A great natural solution for unclogging the drain! Just drop four Alka-Seltzer tablets down the drain, followed by a cup of white vinegar and allow to stand for about ten minutes. Flush with a pot of boiling water. Doing this on a regular basis can help keep that drain clear. This also works to deodorize the drain.

2. Clean a Toilet In A Hurry
Drop two tablets in the toilet, wait 20 minutes for the citric acid to loosen the grime, scrub and flush. The bowl will be clean, shiny, and deodorized. Handy for a quick clean in case of uninvited, unannounced, surprise guests.

3. An All-Purpose Cleaner
Alka Seltzer can also be a good all around cleaner. Plop three tablets into 8 ounces of warm water. Once the fizzing stops, dip a sponge in the water (or you could fill a spray bottle) and wipe down counters, tiles and tubs. You can even place some in your sink and use as mop water. Just add five tablets to one half gallon of water.

4. Soothe Insect Bites
Drop two tablets in warm water, then soak a cotton ball in the solution. Place on the bite for 30 minutes for relief from the insect bites.

5. Catch a Fish
Fish love bubbles. Break a tablet in half and throw it out near your fishing line, or put a tablet inside your tube jig and cast off. The fish won’t be able to resist the stream of bubbles.

6. Remove Burnt On Food From Bakeware
Drop 5 tablets into a sink full of hot water and let your cookware soak for an hour or so. The burnt food will come off with ease.

7. Whiten and Brighten Your Laundry
To get rid of dingy yellow color on white cotton, soak your whites in a solution of a gallon of warm water and two Alka Seltzer tablets. Then hang your whites in the sun to dry to get rid of any lingering stains.

8. Deodorize the Fridge
For a clean, fresh smelling refrigerator, drop an Alka-Seltzer tablet in a cup of water and leave it in the refrigerator for a half hour. If there is still a smell in the refrigerator, then wash down the inside of the refrigerator with another Alka-Seltzer tablet in water.

9. Clean a Glass Jar, Flower Vase or Thermos
For those difficult to clean vessels with narrow-necks, and hard to reach places, drop two Alka-Seltzer tablets in, add hot water and swish it around until the tablets are dissolved and let it sit for an hour. Rinse, and the glass jar, vase or Thermos will be as clean as new.

10. Restore Stained Plastic Containers
Got spaghetti sauce stains on your plastic containers? Simply fill your container with warm to hot water and depending on the size drop 1-2 tablets into the water. Let sit for 30 minutes and the stains will disappear before your eyes.

11. Polish Your Jewelry
Drop two tablets in a bowl of warm water. Let your jewelry soak for about 20 minutes. It will look new again! (Note: This is not safe for pearls or opals.)

12. Build Rockets For Kids
Entertain little ones by heading outside with an empty film canister, filled halfway with warm water. Drop in half a tablet, snap on the lid and place the canister upside down on the sidewalk or driveway. Take a step back and watch your rocket blast off!

13. Clean Your Coffeemaker
Fill the water chamber of the coffeemaker and then drop in three tablets. When the Alka-Seltzer has dissolved, put the coffeemaker through a brew cycle. This will clean out all the internal components. Run through another plain water cycle before using the machine again for coffee.

14. Help For Nicotine Addiction
If you’re trying to quit smoking Alka-Seltzer can help. Take two tablets three times a day to relieve nicotine withdrawal symptoms and curb cravings.

15. Cure Urinary Tract Infections
Showing signs of a urinary infection? Take two tablets in a glass of water as soon as you notice symptoms. Results are almost immediate. Keep in mind that Aspirin is a main ingredient in Alka-Seltzer so those with Aspirin allergies shouldn’t use it.

16. Clean and Deodorize A Cooler
After an outing or trip, add about 1 inch of water to the bottom of your cooler, drop 4 tablets in, and let sit for an hour. After an hour, rinse and dry. All smells will be gone and it will be clean and ready for its next use.

17. Clean Dentures
Drop an Alka-Seltzer tablet into a glass of warm water, and then drop your dentures into the glass for about ten minutes. The citric acid and carbonation will remove the toughest stains from your dentures and other prosthetic dental work. This is an excellent substitute for more expensive denture cleanser products.",,False,,t5_2qhbe,False,,,True,t3_1iq8yv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1iq8yv/17_uses_for_alkaseltzer/,

I can buy lunch in the break room, but to get something that will fill me up and give me enough energy to make it through the day it's going to cost me upwards of $5, and possibly closer to $10. I'm only making a little more than minimum wage, so I'd prefer to stick with something cheaper.

I've tried just doing a peanut butter sandwich and a banana, which I can bring for less than $1, but if that's all I eat for lunch, I'm crazy hungry by the time I get off work and if it's a long day I just can't make it through on only that. Also, after about 3 or 4 days of having this for lunch, I start going a little crazy.

I've also tried bringing a homemade version of lunchables, which I can do pretty cheaply when things are on sale (example: this week, cheez-its were buy one get one free, and blocks of cheese were on sale 2 for $6, so I made 6 lunches with about 20 slices (approx. 1.25 oz) of pepperoni, 20 slices (approx. 2.5 oz) of cheese, and 20 crackers, plus a banana, all of which cost me a little over $2 per lunch) This option seems a little better in terms of keeping me full through lunch, and also it takes me longer to get tired of this, but it's still not a great option.

I'll probably stick with bringing a banana every day since I can consistently get them for about $0.69 per pound and the potassium helps keep my legs/feet from cramping up while I'm working, but what else should I be taking that will keep me full, provide me with some decent nutrients, and cost under $5 per meal (I would really like to keep it under $3, but I know that might not always be possible given my needs.) 

Some other info: 

Our lockers are outside and as far as I know we don't have access to a refrigerator or microwave, so whatever I take has to be able to be kept outside in the summer heat for 3-6 hours before lunch. I have a cold-pack to try and keep it cold, but I don't currently have a lunch cooler (it's on my list of things to buy as I slowly start buying the things no one ever tells you to get when you're starting out on your own) but I do have a leather purse my mom sent me that seems to help keep the pack from completely thawing/warming up by the time I get my break.

I don't need to worry about bringing a drink, since my company is awesome and provides us with free water/tea/lemonade/powerade in the break room and I usually try to drink water with a little bit of powerade mixed in to get some electrolytes. (I actually hate the taste of powerade, but if I dilute it a lot with water I can deal with it.)

**tl;dr** I need advice for what lunches I can pack cheaply for work that will keep me full, give me energy, and can be stored outside with just a freezer-pack.

**UPDATE** Thanks for all the great tips! I went to the farmers market this morning and loaded up on great local ingredients, ran by the grocery store to get the things I couldn't buy local, and now I'm in the process of preparing my meals for the next week or so. Made some amazing hummus that probably only cost me about $5 for 6 servings, bought some local eggs that I'm boiling, and got enough ingredients to make granola for months (oats, peanuts, and raisins were on sale so I stocked up on enough for probably at least 4 big batches)

Also got some local avocados for a decent price, some beef jerky (I'll probably start making my own once my dad sends me his recipe, but they had some at the farmers market, so I bought enough to last me a while) and a few other delicious local foods.",,False,,t5_2qhbe,1341672748.0,,,True,t3_w23g5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/w23g5/what_are_some_tips_for_affordable_healthy_pack/,

5.6g sodium chloride

.74g potassium chloride

artificially sweetened flavor packet


My preparation: ( I converted the grams to teaspoons, since most people do not have chemistry scales.)

1 bottle (238g) PEG 3350. This can be found under various brand names, and Walmart, Kroger, etc. should have house brands. (I bought Walgreens brand Smooth Lax.) 


1-5mg enteric coated Bisacodyl tablet I bought Walgreens Gentle Laxative Tablets, but I had to buy 25 of them. Bisacodyl can also be found as Ducolax, Carter's little pills, etc.

Electrolytes:

1/4 tsp (1.5 g) Morton Lite Salt (contains 50% sodium chloride and 50% potassium chloride, (this provides .75g of KCl).)

1/2 tsp (slightly rounded) (3g) sodium bicarbonate (baking soda)

1tsp (5g) salt.

(This closely approximates the electrolytes found in Halflytely. precision is not at all critical here)

Place PEG 3350 and electrolytes in 2 liter soda bottle. fill halfway and shake well, then finish filling bottle and shake again.

Use the same instructions as with Halflytely.



I sincerely hope you can use this!

Your staff at the clinic is great, BTW.

Take care,

Travesura

**Edit:**
Damn, I was asleep, (10:18 PM MST) and a little anal *squirt* woke me up. But at least I got to read my new messages. Great discussion, and I appreciate all of your input on this subject.

One nice thing about my procedure was that afterward they smiled and congratulated me every time I ripped a huge fart. It seems that copious farting is a really good sign when you are in recovery. I have never experienced such enthusiastic approval for flatulence before!

They sent me home with three photos: 1. A picture of a diverticulum, 2. The opening to my appendix, 3. A nice brown-eye shot of my rectum. Do you have a close up picture of your rectum? I didn't think so. 

**edit.**

The lead nurse at the GI clinic just sent me this: **Thank you for passing this along.  We have several patients that just can not afford the halflytley prep.  Until Medicare begins to pick up the tab, we may be able to help with this.  Hope all is well and back to normal for you**

I am very gratified that my frugal endeavor will now be helping others!

As such I'm a continual apartment dweller, as it affords me a lifestyle where I can pick up and leave without too much hassle.

A few places ago I noticed that the the apartment fridge was almost always running, almost nonstop, plus being very loud.  I figured this was all expensive and not to mention distracting.

Being the avid do-it-yourselfer I pulled the fridge away from the wall and got out the vacuum cleaner, prepared to see if I could improve the state somehow.

I determined that the compressor coils are underneath the fridge, as opposed to the back of it like some (older?) fridges, but that the compressor fan was caked with what looked like the filth of ages.

So I started the project by buying a dryer vent cleaning brush at Target as it fits well under the fridge and began to scrape it back and forth over the coils both from the front and from behind the fridge, as this allowed access to the top and bottom of the main coil array.

I pulled out piles of gunk.  Reams.  Little piles of dry offal that caked the coils I figure contribute mightily to reducing the efficiency of the fridge, meaning the compressor has to stay on longer to keep things cool.  Then I went after the fan itself, by first unplugging the firdge for safety then spraying the gunked up blades with kitchen cleaner spray stuff, then scrubbing it with a scotch pad.

Net result is that the fridge is on much less than it used to be and it runs much more quietly.  I figure this saves me enough money to pay for the brush, and not to mention the peace of mind of a quieter appliance.  Then I cleaned the dryer vent.

I do this in every place I live now, and enjoy making the place better for myself and whoever has it after me.",,False,,t5_2qhbe,False,,,True,t3_15uly8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/15uly8/apartment_dwellers_clean_your_refrigerator_coils/,

I couldn't believe how many people were clueless on credit cards, especially since credit cards are the frugal person's best friend by way of rewards points. Here it is:

**EDIT:** Make sure you read the fine print on the card regarding any kind of hidden fees. I've never run into them, but it always pays to be careful. Go with popular cards that are widely used.

A special thanks to /u/eagleabel33 for this useful tool: https://www.google.com/advisor/

- Find a decent ""rewards"" card, you'll see them advertised everywhere. Look for the ones that give you cash back on gas and groceries. Apply for this card, you'll likely be approved. 

- In a nutshell, cash back will give you a percentage of free money every time you swipe the card for the enumerated items. I always pick gas and groceries, because these are staple items. Cash back on clothing or dinners encourages you to be lavish with money where you normally wouldn't be.

- Now, here's the important bit: Treat that card like cash. Use it on gas, groceries, or anything that you'd use your CASH on. A credit card should NEVER be used as a ""loan"" to buy something you can't afford RIGHT NOW.

- When you get your bill at the end of the month, pay it off in its entirety. The only time you have to worry about interest is if you're stupid and make small payments on what you bought. If you do this, you'll end up paying 5x more than the cost of the item. Pay it off in FULL. 

- This is NO DIFFERENT than using cash. If I would have paid for my tank of gas with a $20 bill, but used my credit card instead, this $20 simply stayed in my bank account. It will be used on the credit card bill at the end of the month, only I'll get some change back via rewards.

- As you use the card, you'll not only be building your credit but you'll be accruing points, hence the ""cash back."" You get free money to use the card, in other words.

- Edit: A few more pros I overlooked thanks to some comments here: Security. Using your credit card online is WAY safer than using a debit card. If your credit card numbers get compromised it's really not that big of a deal, you won't have to pay the balance that someone racked up. This is why it's a good idea to carry your credit card when you travel and only an insubstantial amount of cash. If you lose your wallet, it's not the end of the world.

Credit card companies are not evil, the cards themselves are not sinister. They're amazing. I have NEVER paid any less than 100% of my bill each month, and I literally get paid to use the card via points. If that's not good enough, everything you buy with a credit card more or less has a 30 day free guarantee on it. Say you bought something with the credit card and it's defective or broken, and the company won't accept a return. Well, write a letter to your credit card company disputing that purchase, requesting they remove the charge. Bam.

I have and use one credit card only. I suggest this, especially if you're just starting out.

**TL;DR:** Using a credit card will build credit which you NEED, it will give you free money back via rewards points, and it's a free 30 day warranty on everything you buy.",,False,,t5_2qhbe,1376005765.0,,,True,t3_1jyc76,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1jyc76/why_you_need_a_credit_card/,

But I'm regularly surprised when my friends and family complain about things being too expensive, but never actually do anything about it. So I'm writing this as a PSA.

Think your cable bill is too expensive? Call them up and tell them you're switching to Dish unless your bill is lowered. In my experience they will frequently give you a discount. I saved $20 a month doing this, and all it took was a 5 minute call. 

Bank charged you a fee you don't like? Call them up and simply say you want it refunded.  If you're a customer in good standing, they'll often refund it on the spot. I got a bank fee refunded this week, even though I had actually done the action they charged me the fee for. And this wasn't even a local credit union or anything, it was one of the big banks that are known for terrible customer service.

There's not really any secret to this, you don't have to come up with some intricate script. If you think something is too expensive, simply call and ask for it cheaper. Obviously you won't always get it. But the worst that could happen is they say no, and you've wasted 30 seconds on the phone.

FOOD &amp; SHELTER:

* Breastfeed: Breastfeeding saves, on average, $2,800 per year.  It's the cheapest, healthiest, highest benefit/cost ratio thing you will ever do.

* Puree Your Own Food: Once your baby hits the solid food stage (which actually shouldn't be until 6 months... people start solid food way too early and it's not medically advised), buy a bunch of fruit and veggies on your own, steam them, stick them in a food processor or blender, and freeze in ice cube trays.  It's healthier and WAY cheaper than buying baby food and you DON'T need to that crazy expensive Beabo thing they sell everywhere.  If you really want to save, get a few people together, have everyone choose a different fruit or vegetable, puree, freeze, and then trade. 

* Buy a crib that transitions into a normal bed.  They're more expensive, but generally better made and they'll last you through childhood.  

CLOTHING:

* Don't buy any newborn clothes.  Seriously.  Your kid will be in them for 2 or 3 weeks tops, if that.  If you have a larger baby, they'll NEVER be in them. 

* Refuse to buy full-price baby clothes.  Find your nearest outlet mall with a Carter's or OshKosh outlet, get on their coupon list, and stock up before the start of every season.  TJ Max, Marshalls, and consignments are good bets, too.

* Dresses are expensive and a pain in the neck for pre-walkers.  They are SO cute in the store, but if you have a crawler she won't be able to crawl in them, they bunch up when you have to put your kid in a carseat, and they're generally just a pain.  I can't tell you how many dresses we've bought that our daughter has NEVER worn.  

* Same thing with collared shirts and overalls for boys under the age of 1.  

* Onesies and pants are the way to go for BOTH girls and boys before they start walking. Cheap, easy to clean, and easy to move around in.

* Invest in a case of OxyClean gel.  It's the best stain-treater for kids' clothes out there.

* Cloth diapers are cheaper than disposables although there's a large cost at the outset to buy the supplies.  There's also some debate over whether the amount of water used to clean them and the wear and tear on your washer and dry are worth it.  I won't jump into that debate.  I will say that if you use disposable diapers, Kirkland brand wipes at Costco are a great deal AND a great wipe.

Toys:

* The BEST toys are not toys at all.  We learned that with our first. The most entertaining, stimulating, and open-ended toys are just STUFF.  Cardboard boxes, egg cartons &amp; a bag full of buttons, junk mail, sponges, scraps of fabric, a box full of dried beans with a shovel and some cups in it, etc. etc.  Start thinking outside of the box (or ABOUT the box) and you'll discover a world full of amazing stuff that your kids will love.  We stock up on random things at the Dollar Store and think open-endedly about our household items and our kids are SET.  There are a ton of great kids play blogs that can get the ball rolling for you (no pun intended).

* Our general rule is not to by any ""real"" toys unless we're convinced our kids will play with them for at least 5 years.  So, marbles, Legos, sports equipment (balls, basketball hoops, etc.), blocks, puzzles, etc. are fair game.  Anything made by Baby Einstein and most things made by Fisher Price are not (although Fisher Price does have some cool long-term toys).

* Beyond that, we feel that basic arts and crafts supplies are a good investment both in terms of time they keep our kids occupied and educational value.  Crayons, markers, pom poms, pipe cleaners, construction paper, etc. are inexpensive and worthwhile.  Get them at the Dollar Store or on discountschoolsupply.com.

* IKEA has FABULOUS, high-quality kids toys at very, very cheap prices.  (They have a $15 easel/chalkboard that's worth EVERY PENNY).  It's not a place you would necessarily expect to find great toys, but I'm consistently impressed with their selection.  Their cheap kitchen/storage container/misc. sections are great sources of potential playthings, too.

* I mentioned this site above, but it's worth repeating: discountschoolsupply.com.  Great prices, amazing selection, and good sales.

ACTIVITIES

* There are approximately one hundred million enrichment classes your child can take from birth.  Most of them charge obscene amounts of money.  Don't get sucked in.

* Your local library almost certainly has a free story time for kids.

* Local museums have free classes and activities.

* A lot of children's classes will let you have one free one to scope them out.  They're nice to try on a rainy day.

* Get a group of parents and kids together and have a sing-along.  Or set up an obstacle course.  Or blow bubbles together.  You're doing pretty much EXACTLY what they're doing in the pricey classes.  

SPECIAL TREATS

* There's a tendency to think that ""special treats"" for kids have to involve trips to Disney World or elaborate vacations but we've found that (a) those big trips can be stressful and bewildering to our kids and (b) there are super cheap things that we can do at home that are just as magical and appreciated by them.

* The Dollar Store sells five-packs of glow sticks.  Open one or two packs, activate the glow sticks, turn off the lights, and toss the glow sticks in the bath with your kids. VOILA! Glow bath.  They'll go crazy and you've only spent $2.  If you want to make them REALLY happy, let them take the glow sticks to bed with them. 

* Get your kids out of bed one night and take them out for ice cream in their pajamas.  My parents did that once and it was pretty much the best and most exciting thing that had happened to me in my life up to that point.  Heck, skip the ice cream and just walk around your neighborhood with flashlights. 

* Put a cup or two of baking soda on a platter.  Add food coloring to white vinegar and let your kids drop it into the baking soda to make ""color fizzes.""  

* Build an elaborate tent fort with your kids.  

* Really, anything that's going to get you on the floor and having fun with them is going to special and memorable to them.  

OTHER TIPS:

* Buy everything in a gender-neutral color or blue.  We buy everything over $25 in green.  Or, shoot, get over it and wrap your second child up in his sister's pink blankets.  Who cares?

* Get the most recent copy of a book called ""Baby Bargains."" It reviews pretty much every category of products on the market and will tell you the best deals to be had.  It's an invaluable resource.

Good luck and happy parenting!

EDIT: Wow! So glad so many people found this helpful.  There are so many other good tips and ideas in the comments section.  A few follow-ups from those:

* Baby-Led Weaning: I think baby-led weaning is great.  You exclusively breastfeed for longer (which is better from a medical perspective: it's associated with lower rates of allergies and asthma), skip the puree phase entirely, and then give your child chunks of ""normal"" food when they're ready.  Our first actually skipped the puree phase on her own, so we wound up unintentionally doing baby-led weaning.  She exclusively nursed until 10 months and then was ready for regular meals one day.  We saved a ton of money as a result.  

* Shoes: I was hesitant to even venture into this topic because people have really strong reactions to it, but here goes: your baby does not need shoes and, in fact, SHOULDN'T wear shoes until their walking is well established.  Wearing shoes can negatively impact the development of their feet and ""teach"" toddlers to walk the wrong way.  This is straight out of the mouth of my pediatrician who said, ""I don't want shoes on her feet until she's been walking for a while and then find the cheapest, most flexible pair you can.  Barefoot is better.""  We only started putting shoes on our daughter's feet after she had been walking for a couple of months and she needed protection for when she was walking around outside.  When your kid IS ready for shoes, find a Stride Right outlet.  They have great deals and a they're super helpful at helping you select the right kind of shoe for your kid's phase of development.  (Note: If you do decide to wait on shoes, expect a tremendous amount of pushback, particularly from older people who came from a generation when kids wore shoes ALL THE TIME, including when they were in the crib.  The medical science available does NOT support their position). 

* Convertible Cribs: There's some debate in the comments over whether it's worthwhile to pay extra for a crib that converts given that you'll have to buy another crib if you have another child rather than reuse the first one.  It's a legitimate point, but we ultimately decided that it was still cheaper to buy another crib for our second rather than have to buy a toddler bed and then a ""normal"" bed for our first.  You *could* skip the toddler bed phase.

* Dollar Store Toys: We actually don't buy Dollar Store toys for the reasons discussed below (with the exception of glow sticks): they're virtually all made in China and we worry about the chemicals in the paint.  Also, like I said, most ""real"" toys are actually not super great.  We do, however, buy a lot of play materials from other sections of the store.  They have flat glass marbles in their floral section, arts and crafts supplies, cups and scoops for our sensory bin, food coloring for crafts, etc. etc.  

* Choking Hazards: You obviously should not give your kids buttons, marbles, or anything else remotely small if they are still putting things in their mouth.  Kids grow out of this at different ages, so, for instance, my daughter could safely play with buttons and marbles from 9 months on.  Our son was different.  

* Toy Swaps/Rotations: Another great thing to do is exchange bags full of toys with friends for a period of time. Often, kids will go back to playing with a toy if it's been out of sight for a while.  A friend and I swap back and forth every couple of weeks.

Since most of my worries about this situation stem from my frugality mindset, I figured I'd ask here instead of say, AskReddit, where the advice might be more like 'chase your dreams.'

I have broken hands. I have horrible scar tissue from a surgery that presses on my tendon and makes my thumb and pointer finger difficult to use. It's healed enough for mild to moderate computer use (a normal office job) but it's completely useless for extended to excessive use.

I have a job at a law firm that pays 30k a year plus overtime and bonuses. It's a pretty shitty job, needless to say I am unhappy. I agreed to stay a year so my end date would be July 2013. However, my boss wants me to stay through December or quit in May so I can be replaced. She's very nice, so I don't want to leave her in July and screw her over.

We got a new project that requires excessive (constant) clicking for 9 hours a day, 7 days a week for the next couple months on a tight deadline. My hands simply can't hold up to that and the damage will lessen my employability in the future as the scar tissue builds. Surgery is not an option.

I have 10k in savings and no debt. My boyfriend is in law school, he has a lot of debt but we're not feeling it yet thanks to student loans and won't feel it for another year.

If you were in my situation, would you quit or would you try to do the project regardless of potential damage to your hands? I've been looking for jobs but they're hard to come by where I live and moving is not an option. If I quit, I might risk being unemployed or underemployed for a good while. 

I've spoken to my boss about the issue but she didn't really seem forgiving (she said get a brace. I have eight, they don't help) so it seems like it's come down to all or nothing. I already have an ergonomic set up and the program we have to use won't allow any other accommodations.

**Some topics to consider:**

* Best tools (software, apps, etc) out there to save money.
* Where to put your money?  (high interest debt, emergency fund, 401k match, Roth IRA, Gold, other) Remember there are options for every situation!
* Methods to pay down the debts (snowball, high interest first, etc.
* What worked for you?  What are you doing now to make changes?

1. Adding 0.1% w/w of CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) will significantly help with soil reseposition. 

2. 0.4% of sodium gluconate will help soften your water and with blood, rust and other stains. 

3. Sodium percarbonate (or perborate) is ""bleach alternative"". Unfortunately, for use at room temperature you will need an activator. Just wash at the highest temperature available. 

4. If possible, get a front loading machine. They are much gentler on your clothes and use a lot less water.

5. The pH should be 9-10, preferably on the high side. Doing so you can avoid using preservatives if you use it within a few months.

All linked together. At the beginning of this year, I closed both savings accounts and opened 1 at a local credit union. I've saved more money in the last 5-6 months than I've saved in my whole life. Like combined. 

1. The accounts are not connected ""virtually"" or anything. So I can't easily go online and move 5, 10, 500 dollars out of my savings and into my checking account to pay a bill or buy some dumb shit. If I HAVE to move money out of my savings, it's a whole ordeal.

2. I don't pay bills or have any direct withdrawals out of my savings account. So I don't have to deal with that psychological aspect of seeing my account fluctuate, or ever go down, it ONLY goes up. 

3. I'm glad I moved to a credit union. I'd recommend it for anyone. But the branch I use doesn't have the best hours and they don't have a drive through or atms out front. Which is PERFECT for savings. I can't quickly withdraw money on the weekend for some dumb impulse buy. I can't pull money out at 2am. I have to consider my major purchases and wait until the bank is open to make a withdraw. 

4. My credit union is not for profit and I've earned more money in interest (not a lot, but still) in the last 5 months than I ever did at Chase.

I think there was no minimum deposit to open the account. And obviously everything’s free. Do it! Do it today! No matter how little money you are starting with. If you can close a big, corporate bank account in the process, that’s a plus, but even if you only have 1 account and this will be your only savings, do it today!

Edit: Lots of good points and replies. Thanks!

5. Making deposits is super easy! You just roll up to the counter (there's never a wait) and hand them your account number and any small amounts of cash or checks you have. If I ever have extra cash in my checking/operating account, I'll write a check to myself and deposit it at the CU. 

Yupisyup brought up a nice little point. Security. It's easier for someone to steal my debit/checking info and wipe out my measly checking account.

So next time I'm planning on telling whomever swaps my new tires in to put the old ones in the trunk so I can save the money and just take them to the recycling center. Chances are you also have one of these recycling sites nearby.

TL;DR - When replacing your vehicle's tires, instead of paying a disposal fee you can recycle them yourself for free.

UPDATE: the recycling convenience site is 1.5mi from my home and is also on my way to work. I can easily fit 4 tires in the back of my VW golf TDI (which also saves me fuel on my arduous 1.5mi journey).

We do off-grid solar for remote telecommunications sites and other things which have no grid connection.  We have never installed solar power on a house and have no intention to do so any time soon.  That said, the same principles apply in calculating a system's monthly output and your required load.

Disclaimer 2: The calculations I will give you are without tax rebates, subsidies or feed-in tariffs.  There are too many jurisdictions around the US and world for me to research all of them, so you will have to take the figures I give you and figure out the total capital outlay minus whatever rebates you can get for your local installation.

The information I need to calculate a solar power system is:

a) Your approximate location

b) The rate you're paying for electricity in dollars per kWh.  For example, in one location the first 350 kWh on your bill might be 10.5 cents per kWh, and kWh from 351 to 850 at billed at 12.5 cents.  Your monthly electrical bill (for example, $236.15 divided by number of kWh consumed) in mid summer and in mid winter is useful.

c) The amount you're willing to spend on a system.


**edit:** the pvwatts results I'm cutting and pasting into these replies are for cumulative kWh generated in one month.  an example:

""Results""
""Month"", ""Solar Radiation (kWh/m^2/day)"", ""AC Energy (kWh)"", ""Energy Value ($)""

1, 3.09, 605, 67.76


the first number is the month (january), the second is sunlight solar radiation as per the NREL climate model for the area, the third number and the most important is the kWh generated per month (605).

1371392099.0,372,self.Frugal,1ggd6t,A Zen Millionaire; a father's day tribute.,492,120,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1ggd6t/a_zen_millionaire_a_fathers_day_tribute/,"I was home from college, most likely my freshman year.  Dad and I had run to the grocery store for something- who knows what.  Dad always did the grocery shopping in our family.  Given that he wasn’t much one for cooking, I think it was his way of still influencing our meals.  As we went down the aisles we spoke about things 19 year old girls and their father’s talk about- classes, friends, money....  I mentioned that I was poor, but so was everyone else.

He laughed at my being poor.  “You’re not poor; you’re broke.” 

“Oh?”

“Not having money doesn’t make you poor.  You are smart, you are becoming educated, you have options.  You simply don’t have money right now.  It’s fixable, and it’s temporary.  Being poor is lack of options- it’s a state that is not likely to change.”

I thought of this, and knew he spoke from experience.  I remember recently being told a story of my dad’s childhood from his sister.  She laughed as she described the situation.  You see, there were 5 children, 2 parents, and some grandparents living in their small house, my father being one of the youngest, and one of the shortest.  My grandfather had caught a deer while hunting, and there was venison on the table.  My aunt describes my dad in the back of the crowd that was gathered around the table jumping up and down “don’t forget me, don’t forget me!”  He was trying to get to the table to get some venison, but the larger bigger siblings were blocking him off.  I laughed at the story- thinking of my vertically challenged father fighting to get noticed.

That is when I noticed my dad wasn’t laughing.  To me, and his sister, it was an anecdote about a particular situation; to my father it was a memory of being hungry.  Truly hungry, a much more permanent state.

Dad and I had rounded the corners of the isles and found ourselves wandering back towards the produce section.  My dad says to me “Did you know I’m a millionaire?”

Now, I was not intimately familiar with my families financial situation.  And, I knew my parents had done very well for themselves in life.  But, I think I would have noticed if my parents were millionaires.

“Oh are you?” I smirk.

“Sure I am.  I’m a Zen Millionaire.”

“A Zen Millionaire?”

“Yeah.... you see I may not be a millionaire everywhere I go.  But, when I am in the produce section of a grocery store I know that I can afford whatever it is my body needs.  This is the healthiest section, and if I want it, I can buy it.  I don’t have to think ‘can I afford a salad today?’ because I know I can.  I may have to compare prices in every other section of this store.  But, when it comes to the fruits and vegetables, I don’t have to question if I can afford it.  That makes me a Zen Millionaire.”

Since that day I’ve been broke many of times-- on and off, never permanent.  But, to this day when I walk into the produce section of a grocery store I remind myself that those things that are healthiest for me, I can afford.  I don’t have to jump or wave my arms or beg to be noticed.... I can afford to buy what is healthiest for me, even if it means sacrificing elsewhere.  And, I’m pretty sure, that makes me a Zen Millionaire too.

I've spent a lot of time researching what would be most effective for myself, and have determined that the must have ingredients for my pre-workout are beta-alanine, l-arginine, taurine and caffeine.  By buying the ingredients separately and in bulk, you can save a lot of money.  


**My blend contains:**


3.2g of beta-alanine, 4.6g of l-arginine, 3g of taurine, and 400mg of caffeine.  Flavoring is additional, I'll probably throw a crystal light packet in there.


**My reasoning:**


The non essential amino acid beta-alanine raises muscle carnosine levels, which allows you to perform at higher intensities by preventing  a buildup of H+ ions, which helps prevents lowering of pH in your muscles.  In addition, beta-alanine gives you that famous tingling feeling that gets you psyched to lift.
Beta-alanine and taurine compete for uptake, so in order to prevent long term health complications from a lack of taurine, I'm stacking it with the beta-alanine.  Aside from that, taurine itself has many benefits.
The semi-essential amino acid arginine is a precursor to nitric oxide, which causes vasodilation.  
Then of course, caffeine is essential for me to have energy to workout after a long day.

Before I moved, I rented a room in a crappy house for cheap and was able to save about $1000 a month which all was being saved for down payment/furniture/house stuff etc. After the down payment, there were a couple months with a high credit card bill (well, high for me and which always paid off on time and its a rewards card) and I wasn't sure where my net savings per month would end up. I knew I would still be saving money every month but thought it might be closer to $500 a month. 

Well, I got a roommate, cashed in some credit card rewards for some 'on sale' gift cards ($80 in rewards to get a $100 gift card), scoured craigslist for things I needed, woke up for garage sales, and by sheer luck, got a very nice 6 chair dining set and curio cabinet for free from a friend's uncle. I've learned how to fix a toilet and a garbage* disposal, painted the entire house myself (got the paint for 40% off!), and started to put together a little garden in my backyard. 

Today, I went to Mint and looked at the trending. For the last three months, I've been back up to saving close $1,000 a month! I own a 2006 built house with over 1800 sq ft and I'm saving just as much as when I lived in a crappy 1970's rental! I'm very happy to realize my frugal habits have paid off in a very big way. I didn't have to give up anything to finally have the house I always wanted. 

Thanks for listening and I hope your frugal habits get you what you want!   :)

She had run her old car into the ground. She managed to get a really decent deal and the car is excellent. It's clean, in great shape, and everything works like it did when the car was brand new.

My car antenna fell off a while ago, and I've gotten horrible FM reception.  My driver's side door has the power-window controls and the buttons are broken and take a real ""master's"" touch to get them to work.  Five years ago I knocked my passenger-side mirror off. I meant to fix it, eventually, but ended up patching it with duct-tape and leaving it.  A couple years ago, I was in a very minor accident where I bumped into someone. It loosened my front bumber. It wasn't a major deal and I haven't bothered to fix that either.  My car is also pretty dirty and it just feels old.  

In short, I was feeling ""The Itch."" I started wanting a new car. All the faults of my car were eating at me and I kept thinking of how nice it would be to have a newer car.

Today it got to the point where I actually made a list of the things I hated about my car. I was trying to find a way to justify spending money I didn't have to spend.

Then it occurred to me, all the things I hated about my car could be fixed. And most of them could be fixed really cheaply and easily.  In fact, a new control panel for the power windows, antenna, mirror (housing and all), as well as a few cosmetic bits cost me under $150.  I've ordered them and will install them myself when they arrive.

I'm going to clean my car out completely (except for the insurance, registration, and manual) and take the time to really clean it out. I can vacuum and shampoo all the seats and carpets at no cost because we have the stuff to do that. A nice wash, wax, and self-detail and my car is practically brand new.

The only other things it really needs are an alignment and a tune-up (both already on my to-do list).  I'm even going to get a quote on fixing the bumber and will do it if it's cheap. I remember being quoted $200 or $250 when I first was in the accident.

In the end, it's a few days of work and under $500.  That's less than the fees I would pay on a new car, let alone any payments or increase in insurance. And it will solve my ""itch.""

It's not the cheapest. Leaving things as they are would be cheapest. But it's a lot cheaper than allowing myself to make a really costly decision.

Edit: I will provide before and after pictures, when I do this.

I have experimented with tons of different solutions, and have realized some solutions mixed together are very toxic. As an owner of four animals and someone with children at their home frequently, I realized being frugal AND all-natural is very important to a healthy lifestyle.

Here is a list of my homemade solutions:
All Purpose Cleaner:
3 tsp. Vinegar
1/2 tsp. Washing Soda
1/2 tsp Castile Soap
2 c. Hot Water
Any essential oil for smell. I use scented Castile Soap because I know many oils can be very deathly to cats. Check your house plants too!

Glass Cleaner:
1/4 c Rubbing Alchohol
1/4 c. White Vinegar
1 tbsp. Corn Starch
2 c. Distilled, filtered or boiled water
Distilled makes for no streaks!

""Pledge"" knockoff:
2 tsp. Olive Oil
2 c. Water
1/4 c. White Vinegar
10-15 drops of Citrus

""Febreeze"" knockoff:
1/8 c. Fabric Softener
2 tbs. Baking Soda
Fill the rest with water and add Lavendar

Vinegar and Lavendar Laundry Softener:
1 Quart White Vinegar
25 Drops of Lavendar
1 tsp. Rubbing Alchohol
1/2 c. per load
Also Peppermint is really great for laundry too!!

Dry Laundry Detergent:
1 Box Washing Soda
1 Box Borax
3 Bars Felsnaptha Soap
2 Tubs Oxygenated Bleach
2 c. Baking Soda
Oxygenated Bleach is a derivative of Hydrogen Peroxide. Since it is not edible, I am not crazy about this solution, but I use it on my fiances work clothes because it works so well! This solution can be used without the oxygenated bleach and still works wonders! A friend of mine adds a jar of those laundry scents, I just add essential oils. This batch will last you FOREVER. I mean forever people. You only need 1 tbsp per small wash and 2 for larger. It lasted me almost a whole year.

Grease Cutter:
2c. Water
1/4 c. Castile Soap
10 drops Lavendar

No Grate Laundry Soap: (SO EASY!)
3 tbs. Borax
3 tbs. Washing Soda
2 tbs. Dish Soap (All Natural works well)
20-30 drops of oil.
Put in old laundry detergent bottle and fill the rest of the way with water. 

Room or pillow/sheets spray:
1 tbs. Vodka
10 drops oil
2 c. Water

Bleach Alternative:
12 cups water
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 cup hydrogen peroxide
2 c. Per Load

These are all just recipes and ideas I have found to be very useful. No choking on toxins while trying to clean the bathroom. I feel like we are pretty trained to think bleach and windex and other toxic cleaners are what smell good, but they are so harmful to us, and it's so much cheaper to make your own!! Buying all the ingredients to make my homemade cleaners and detergents cost me a total of about 32 dollars, but it lasts me years. Years, people!

I am not at all experienced with buying cars (1 car 12 years ago), and I don't enjoy negotiation. For what it's worth, I have excellent credit. So some of my experience may have been dictated by that YMMV. 


I started with cars.com and autotrader.com. After I found the car with the options I wanted, I jumped on the dealer's website and verified it was still in stock and the sticker price. One important note is dealers don't put all their stock on those sites.


I hit kbb.com, edmunds.com and NADA.com to get an independent price estimate for that particular car. I also checked the free carfax to make sure everything was in order there. 


Went to lendingtree.com and filled out a used car loan application. I really did it just to see what kind of rates I might get..I didn't expect to USE any of the financing, but I ended up being approved for an auto loan by Capitol One with a great rate. I should have called my local bank to see what kind of rate I'd get with them, but I didn't feel like spending the time on the phone. 


I made up a little card in Excel that showed the sale price of the car, my down payment, and what my monthly payment would be given various sale prices/down payments. I brought it with me to the dealership and kept it handy. You ALWAYS want to negotiate based on final price. However, you do want to have an idea what your payment will be while you're negotiating. The card helped me to stay aware when numbers were flying around.


ALL the buying guides I read said you should always be prepared to walk away from the deal. So, at the dealership I  wanted to see if the salesman would chase me if I walked. I made an pretty low offer ($2,300 under sticker), and only came up $300 after their counter, and wouldn't budge after that. That was WAY under what I was prepared to spend, but they accepted $2,000 off sticker. I even said I wouldn't pay the $129 document fee and they knocked THAT off. Being a dick paid off to the tune of $1,400!


I made it clear when I started talking to the salesman that I had already secured financing. However, I said I'd be happy to finance with them if they could get me a better interest rate. When we eventually sat down to sign papers they told me they just matched my rate from Capitol One. That's the one thing I wish I had protested. I couldn't muster enough douchebag to make an issue of it though. 


I was pretty anxious about the buying experience, but I stuck to my guns and it paid off. The only mistakes I can see are not spending more time on the phone checking out financing and not dickering over the interest rate. Those shouldn't bite me too hard since I'll likely pay the loan off early.

1346328271.0,354,self.Frugal,z2ncb,"Frugal Cooking: A Friend turned my head, and here's how I cook chicken now.",649,295,164,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/z2ncb/frugal_cooking_a_friend_turned_my_head_and_heres/,"A few years ago I offered to cook dinner for my best friend, an ethnic chinese Brit. In true British fashion I cooked him a roast chicken meal with all the trimmings. It was a lovely meal, but he was horrified at the wastage - for three people I used a bag of potatoes, a bag of carrots, a pre-cooked bag of yorkshire puddings, a box of gravy and a whole chicken (there's so much meat left! Why are you throwing it away?!). He offered to return the favor of a meal, in my own kitchen. He used the same sized chicken, and a few inexpensive vegetables and noodle packs to feet three of us for multiple meals. It was this that led me down the road of using 'every part of the cow'  in my cooking, and I'd like to share an example with you.

As a primer, we always plan our meals for the week and try to overlap ingredients (i.e. a 1kg bag of potatos will be used for multiple meals), and we have a cupboard of spices and herbs.

Ingredients:

* Whole Chicken
* Potatos
* Greens
* Starchy veg like carrots/parsnips/whatever
* Dried noodles or cabbage, dry rice
* Soy/Fish sauce
* Lime/Ginger powder

Here's what I'd make:

* **Meal one** - Butterfly a chicken (cut the backbone out and flatten it, essentially) and roast it. While that's going boil two portions of potatoes, taking two portions out early and adding them to a roasting tin. I bast the chicken a few times and at this point I tend to boil up frozen green beans (1gbp/kg) too. Cut off a breast and divide it between plates, and add the roast potatos and greens. 

After this orgy of delicious chicken, do some work:

* Preparation work for meat: divide the chicken into the other breast, thighs, drumsticks, wing halves, and 'misc' (where you're scraping every last piece of meat off)
* Preparation work for stock: Pour off the roasting fat and juice into a jug and cool.
* Preparation work for broth: Add chopped celery/carrot/onion/garlic to a big pot and fry them off, then add the chicken carcass and boiling water. Keep it topped up with water for a few hours then strain, cool and freeze/refridgerate.

Here's what'd be left over to use:

* **Meal two** - Roast chicken with mash: Other breast and potato mash/greens from the previous meal
* **Meal three** Soup: Fry up onion and carrot in a pot, add the gelatinous stock (skim the fat off first, sometimes I use it to fry the veg) and the meat from a couple of wings. Add some root veg (celeriac, turnip, parsnip, carrot, potato, swede, etc.) and boil. You can blend smooth
* **Meal four** Noodle Stir-fry: Marinade a thigh/drumstick in some 5-spice and oyster sauce, then fry some onion with peppers and add either sliced cabbage strands or pre-soaked noodles, then add the meat and some sliced tomatoes and either lime-juice/fish sauce/crushed chillis or ginger and soy sauce.
* **Meal Five** Chicken Stir Fry: Repeat above with pre-cooked rice or broccoli/carrot
* **Meal Six** Heat up some beans (ideally dried, soaked and simmered, but canned is fine), cook some rice in the chicken broth and add some sweetcorn and the remainder of the shredded chicken.
* **Meal Seven** Ginger Chicken Soup: Onion, garlic, tomatoes and chicken broth with a CRAPLOAD of chilli powder and ginger makes a great chicken soup with even just the meat from one or two wings


None of this is difficult, for me the mindset was much easier to come to grips with when I realised 'Yes, I may waste this carrot if I don't use it, but it's extremely cheap and I likely can make use of it and save money in the long run'. I was terrified of the food going to waste, but re-purposing and overlapping meals like this has led to good savings, and I need to buy less (no more buying stock cubes or packs of chicken breasts). 

Obviously not every meal is like this - but I've come to realise less is more in terms of ingredients -'all the trimmings' is rarely a good thing (/r/minimeals is a bridge too far IMO, but it's got the right idea).",,False,,t5_2qhbe,False,,,True,t3_z2ncb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/z2ncb/frugal_cooking_a_friend_turned_my_head_and_heres/,

I married young, and when my husband spiralled off into a bout of clinical depression I dropped out of college mid-semester to look after him and make sure our bills were paid.

Then he walked out on me. The divorce was nasty and expensive, left me with nothing of value except the lease to an apartment I couldn't afford, and now my academic record is messed up something fierce. I don't think there's a college in Canada that will accept me, anymore.

Since the divorce, I've tried to move a few times (following promising leads of trustworthy roommates) but I'm still pretty screwed.

 A few years later, I'm working six days a week but nobody seems to offer consistent hours (I'd like to work two jobs, but they always seem to conflict!) and nobody wants to pay more than minimum wage.

I've been subsisting off of water, beans, lentils and rice for long enough that my diet doesn't bore me, anymore.

I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't watch television, and my phone plan is as cheap as is reasonable ($50/mo) as it gets, considering the damn thing IS my computer and my only link to my family hallway across the country.

I have a dog. She keeps me sane, because I don't go out and socialize. When I get lonely and upset, we go for a walk and I feel a little better. She IS my entertainment budget.

But living the way I do, I make rent, I feed myself, I keep my dog alive, and I have a telephone. I haven't bought new shoes or clothes for two years. I haven't bought a goddamn tube of mascara or had my hair cut. All my furniture is picked out of trash bins and my hobbies all somehow seem to revolve around darning my socks and finding new ways to eat carrots (again) without wanting to choke myself.

I miss my family. I miss my friends. I thought I was being smart when I decided to cinch my belt and focus on getting rid of my debt, but I feel emotionally destitute and my finances haven't improved-- they've just stopped getting worse. My credit is going to take years to recover.

I can't keep this up for much longer. There's no reward in living this way. 


**Are there any STABLE jobs out there that don't require a degree?** How do I get myself hired, there? Fast food, grocery stores, and cafes are killing me with their ridiculous hours and insubstantial wages.

**How can I go back to school and end the vicious minimum-wage cycle, if my GPA is tattered?** 


EDIT: by and large, the money I make is swallowed up making pittance-payments on a stack of bills. I'm not blowing my dough on current expenses-- but I'm not making significant dents in the old one and I've been at this for two years.

This TV was in the scrap pile at the dump in my town. It is a 43-inch 720p Panasonic HDTV from 2005, with an HDMI port, that retailed for $2000 at the time ([model number PT-43LC14](http://shop.panasonic.com/shop/model/PT-43LC14?t=specs&amp;support#tabs)). After opening it up and replacing a single $30 part, it works perfectly. One man's trash is another man's treasure!

It's a LCD projection HDTV, which is old-school tech these days and less reliable because the bulbs are fragile, burn out after a while, and need to be replaced, adding to the TV's cost.

I plugged it in and noticed that the the TV made normal TV buzzing sounds, but no picture came up. The power button had a blinking red light and a another red light came on with the label ""LAMP"" above it. I found a manual for the TV online and looked up the problem, which told me the symptoms I identified were the result of a broken lamp. I followed the manual's instructions to remove the lamp and lo and behold, it was shattered.

I googled the type of lamp required for this model of TV, then googled the lamp's model number. I found lamps with housing on Amazon for $50-80. Pshaw! I then found single bulbs on eBay for $30 (and a remote for $11). That's more like it!

I found a how-to video on a consumer site for replacing the bulb - as opposed to the manual's instructions for replacing the entire housing with the lamp (what a wasteful thing to do!). I plugged it in, and there was light! And I looked upon it and saw that it was good. And then I rested.

Even with the need to replace the bulbs every year or so, $30/year for the lifetime of this TV is a great freaking deal when there was no cost up front!

*Edit: linked to product page. There was some debate about whether it was LCD or DLP. It's definitely LCD.

I took out loans and got them for college, but I've never been to a dentist in my life (I'm 32 years old). My mother and father could not properly provide for me or my siblings throughout our lives — my father was a horrible alcoholic — and so this money came as a surprise from a relative who pitied myself and my siblings, and cared about us. 

Personally I have pretty massive student loans… about 200K… I was trying hard to better myself and raise my life from laboror to teacher, and it added up quickly after graduate school. 

It has not worked out — I have defaulted upon my loans because I freelance as a content writer / web designer now, and the market has been shit for the last couple years.

I realize that I am lucky to have this inheritance, but I also realize that this is not a lot of money in the larger scale of my own debt… and I would rather not put this money into a checking account and get the account frozen or something.

I just don't know what to do: I want the money to WORK for me, even if it is a tiny bit… but I am also very fucked for life financially. Is there any way to protect this money and make it into something useful?

I might make well over $10,000 in a single day, then make not a penny for the next 4 - 12 months.  When you have a wad of quick money, it is very easy to blow through it, leaving yourself with nothing to live off of when time's are lean.  

This is how I deal with it:

Don't think of it as ""your money"", think of it as ""company money"", and the company pays you very poorly.  Have a separate account for all that money.

I pay myself living expenses plus $200 for the month.  That's $200 for food, drink, and entertainment.  I have separate bank accounts, so I have to do a transfer and wait 24 hours to get my money, so this limit isn't just an arbitrary one I can bypass without effort, if I *need* to spend more, I actually have to plan for it.  This forces me to continue living cheaply.

That means no celebrations, no week long benders, no vacations; nope, that money is all tied up.  I have to keep on living as frugally as possible.

Don't buy tools or equipment for your business because you think you might need them, or they might help.  Wait for a catastrophe to present itself, a situation where you simply cannot go on without buying a certain tool.  The only exception to this is when something will save you a ton of time or money in the future.

Keep records of everything!  Have a master spreadsheet for all tools, when you bought them, how much they cost, how much inventory you have in stock, which pieces are out on consignment and which you have at hand, what people have purchased, etc.  Even keep track of favours, so you have a record of who ""owes you one"" and who you owe favours too. You don't want to be the guy who is *always* leeching off a few people, in a small industry, everyone knows everyone, your reputation is everything, so you want to stay ahead of this)

- now i have my 14 year old sister (her bday is friday as well!) for the summer and may have to permanently live with us due to my dads situation
- this is our very first apt and we have **nothing** but a bed and tv 
- oh and we have a kitten (smaller but important mouth to feed)

We plan on buying a futon for the living room so she can sleep on it too but im so scared of buying one off craigslist due to a HORRIBLE experience with bed bugs! They are a nightmare  to get rid of!

- what kind of food should we get on our first shopping trip?

- we have a sams card but i have no experience buying in bulk and would hate to waste food due to not eating it fast enough

- tips on where to get pots, pans, forks etc?

- what can i do with my sister over the summer so she can have fun and not worry herself to death about my father

-side jobs i can do after my day job?

-ways to get rid of stress so i dont lose my mind?

Any tip would help greatly!


Edit: sorry i can't figure out how to edit on baconreader so i just logged on.
My father lived with my grandma after the split so no house of his own and they live 200 miles away i had to drive to get my sister. 

I had looked in to food stamps and i think i make too much money but just barely.  I may email and just ask if i can have assistance at least a month or two. 

Thank you all for your advice!  i don't I've ever had so much comfort from people I've never met.

1345709129.0,340,self.Frugal,yoq2b,"I was extremely nervous about it but I saved more than $86,000 with a refinance. Now is the time to do so! My story inside...",493,153,180,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/yoq2b/i_was_extremely_nervous_about_it_but_i_saved_more/,"I should start by saying I'm a realistic person. I understand that not everyone would benefit from a refinance. In my case, however, I couldn't be happier.

I bought my house 9 years ago just before my 20th birthday. My fiancée was pregnant with our first child and we decided we no longer wanted to rent. The only place that had most of what we wanted was small-ish (less than 1,000 sqft) but we figured we'd make it work.  

We purchased our house with a 30 year loan and a 6.38% interest rate. At the *time* it was a damn good rate considering we had no money down and I'm sure our credit wasn't great as we were so young.

After a few years things got a bit bumpy, fast forward and I'm a single father with custody of my kids, I've had my share of struggles. The divorce left me with $5k in credit card debt and a car that got repo'd (all of which I owed to my ex wife). I've done fairly well for myself since, especially considering I do not currently have a college education (coming soon, hopefully). I've got one major vice when it comes to spending (feel free to stalk my posts over at /r/dvdcollection) but I don't smoke, drink alcohol or eat fast food very often (I don't even drink coffee)... I mostly hang out with my kids and make crafty stuff, ride bikes, try my hand at photography and watch movies. Spending time with my family has saved me a lot of money and made me a better Dad.

So... I made a goal for myself. Pay off my house by the time I turn 40. It seems impossible. Very little of my mortgage payment was even going towards principal. Last year I looked into refinancing. I shopped around to different lenders and in doing so I apparently caused my credit score to dip a bit. This was upsetting especially after realizing that a refinance wasn't going to help much after closing costs etc. I backed out and tried not to think about it.

Well that has lasted about a year and I decided to try again. To my surprise my credit score is now above 740 (pay your bills on time, kids!). The mortgage people were telling me I'd be able to lower my interest rate from 6.38 down to a 3.5%! Not only that but they said even if I lowered the term to a 15 year loan my monthly payments could STILL go down. There was one hurdle: The Appraisal. This was the only thing that I had to pay for out of pocket. It came to about $400 and was non-refundable. I decided to bite the bullet and just get it over with. Luckily the house was valued high enough for me to avoid a private mortgage insurance that would have lessened my monthly savings.

After all was said and done I lessened the term of my loan by 6 years, lowered the interest rate by almost half and my monthly payment by $80!! This will still not allow me to reach my goal of paying off my house before I'm 40, therefore I have one other tactic: I make half mortgage payments every two weeks. This was an incredibly easy decision for me to make... I get paid every two weeks, why not pay the bill every two weeks. In doing so, I am essentially overpaying a half a payment every 6 months which adds an extra full months payment to the principal each year.

It's still going to be close, and I'm sure there will be obstacles along the way, but I just might reach it, and after that day the only thing I'll need to worry about is taxes and utilities. Can you imagine how much stress that must release? gah... can't wait.

I have a 17k school loan payment I've been paying for about two years (I had to start paying it even if still in school because I was a part-time student). I was doing the minimum payments because my job and hours were uncertain for a while. I was paying 138.33$/month with interest rate of 4.05%. I was shocked to see that it means over 600$ in interests a year, I guess I never saw it like that before. It means I'd be paying that for another 9 years WTF

Anyway. I have zero other debt. I make 865$ every two weeks and I have about 5K on the side (because my job doesn't give me insurance, sick days or whatever and it's a contract and it makes me feel safer to hav ea little money on the side and not just put it all on my loans). My total spendings are 1300-1400$ a month (including my school loan payments). I just bumped the payment to 175$/month, but paid every 2 weeks to cut on interests. 

My question is : what's the max payment I can go with ? Should I keep the low payments and put some extra money on my loan when I have extras ? Or should I just jack up my payments ?

Thanks a lot I appreciate it. If it changes anything, I'm a 26 y/o female and English isn't my mother tongue so bare with me :)

Store brand items are rarely made by 'cheaper' companies in grocery chains.  Usually a large brand will repackage the store brand item so they can get more items and facings in the store and preferential treatment from corporate buyers when selling new items.  The ingredients of the store brand item won't be EXACTLY the same as the name brand BUT it will still have the same level of quality, which is what a lot of people are worried about when buying store brand.

OK, on to the trick.  I'm sorry if most people already know this in [/r/frugal](/r/frugal) but no one I have talked to has, so I'm sharing it.

Lets say I'm having a cookout and need to buy bratwurst but the high quality Johnsonville Brats are 2 dollars more expensive per pack than the store brand and I need to keep prices low but keep the quality of my meats for the BBQ high (so my friends don't think I'm a cheap ass... but the PBR might give that away...).

[Here is a picture of a package of Johnsonville Brats](http://i.imgur.com/phH8p.jpg) Do you see the small circle above ""Previously handled frozen for your protection, refreeze or refrigerate""?  That is the serial number for the factory/slaughterhouse where the meat was packaged (in this case 34225).  

Even the biggest names only have handful of places that will package their product and (usually) only one that will handle the grocery chains in your region.  That location will also handle/package the store brand items.  

SO, match the serial number on a name brand meat product that you know to be quality with the store brand meat product of a similar type.  If they are the same, you have found who actually makes the store brand item.  It takes a little while to find out exactly who is making what, but it will save you money if you are looking for quality along with low prices.


**edit** P.S. I've worked with 8 grocery chains (actually in their stores/offices) in 9 states in 3 regions, and the best?  Who has the best prices for the most quality product AND treats their employees the best AND has the best atmosphere??  Trader Joes, hands-fucking-down the best god damned operation I've seen in these United States of America.

**edit 2** Ok, I hate when redditors do that whole ""I'm going to edit this popular post and be total douchebag"" thing.  But I just created [/r/grocerystores](/r/grocerystores) and I'll be updating it regularly with grocery store reviews, hopefully more posts like this one, and other tips, also a place to bitch about working in a grocery store and making connections.

Fast forward seven months. We moved in together recently into a small, one-room apartment with a small oven and little counter and freezer space. I start my second job this week, and we're both in school part-time over the summer and resuming full-time school at the end of August. And frankly, neither of us has the time or energy to cook like good, frugal vegetarians should.

Typical meals for us include:

**Breakfast**:
* Quaker instant oatmeal
* Sometimes, cereal, usually Reese's Puffs or honey bunches of oats
* Whole-wheat bagels with cream cheese
* Toast
* Fruit: whatever's on hand, apples, bananas, cherries
* Fiber-one bars (the walmart, off-brand ones)
* Rarely, one of us will feel like making pancakes

**Lunch**:
* Most commonly, peanut-butter sandwiches
* Salads made from spinach, with whatever we have on hand thrown in: commonly morningstar veggie patties, fresh broccoli, some cut-up cheddar cheese
* Cheese sandwiches, when we find good bread on sale at walmart

**Dinner**:
* Soup and grilled cheese
* Pasta
* Cheap frozen pizzas
* Veggie chili (canned, of course) with bulk-bag rice and broccoli
* Morningstar burgers with salads or frozen french fries
* Salads with pirogies and other veggies

**Snacks**:
* Mixed nuts, usually Planters
* We buy a lot of processed foods, but we try to keep it cheap. 50-cent donuts from walmart, off-brand cupcakes for $2/box, dollar-store chips with cheese dip, cheese and fruit, etc.

So, what can we make that is cheap and not too time-consuming? I've tried looking for crock-pot/slow-cooker stuff (which we'd have to buy), but a lot of it looks more complicated than I remember it being when we ate meat. I used to do the ""cook a giant pot of sauce and spaghetti in bulk and freeze it"" when I lived with my parents, but not our freezer is really tiny and taken up by the Morningstar stuff, frozen pizzas, pirogies, french fries, ice cream, etc. so I'd have to buy a bigger freezer. Any suggestions, anyone?

Also, we eat out once a week or so. It used to be more, but we've cut it down a lot. We try not to spend more than $20 and rotate between Chinese, a local diner with good veggie food, and pizza/Italian restaurants. I eat at Taco Bell several times a week because I work there and get a half-off discount when I'm working. So an already cheap $5 meal (I usually get cheaper stuff, too) only costs me $2.50. In my mind that's pretty frugal, but I could be wrong.

**TL;DR** Lazy vegetarians with limited freezer space looking for quick and frugal veggie meal ideas because we spend way too much money on veggie burgers and frozen dinners.",,False,,t5_2qhbe,False,,,True,t3_wlo8l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/wlo8l/my_boyfriend_and_i_are_the_laziest_vegetarians/,

1348517076.0,328,self.Frugal,10eqd9,What most Vets don't want you to know about flea medication and how to potentially save hundreds of dollars.,486,158,212,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/10eqd9/what_most_vets_dont_want_you_to_know_about_flea/,"So first off I'd like to say I am a licensed Veterinary Technician, not just some stranger who thinks this is a good idea.

Instead of purchasing the individual doses for the different sizes of your cats/dogs, you can purchase the 88-110lb pack of Advantage Multi. I prefer this brand because it treats for fleas, the 3 most common types of worms, and heartworm(note: it does not TREAT heartworm, only acts as a preventative)! Each bottle of the 88-110lb dose contains 5mls of the liquid(that's almost 6 months worth for one cat) which can easily be dosed down to treat all of your animals no matter what the size with a 3cc syringe(DON'T USE A NEEDLE, DUH).

The dosages are, for Advantage and Advantage Multi(DO NOT INCLUDE ADVANTIX) are as follows:

0-10lbs = 0.4ml
11-20lbs = 0.8ml
21-30lbs = 1.2ml
31-40lbs = 1.6ml
41-50lbs = 2.0ml
51-60lbs = 2.5ml
61-70lbs = 3.0ml
71-80lbs = 3.5ml

For Frontline:

All Cats 0.5ml
Dogs 11-22 pounds = 0.67ml
Dogs 23-44 pounds = 1.34ml
Dogs 45-88 pounds = 2.68ml
Dogs 89-132 pounds = 4.0ml 

You may find, when asking your vet, they will refuse to do this for you out of their own personal or, in a few instances, greedy volition. I had the honor of working under a vet who didn't like taking people for all they have. He is very honest and does anything he can to save you a few dollars. He was the only vet I worked for that actually told people they could do this and had to hide it from the other vet because he would get in trouble for not making more money for them. He will always be my favorite veterinary. I left the clinic because it was in a shelter and at times I would euthanize literal scores of animals a day. It, and the bureaucracy of a large non-profit facility, weighs on you after a few years. 

The other vets I worked for let myself, the people who fostered our animals(I worked for shelters mostly), and the other techs use the means of dosing, but did not want us advocating it to our clients, no matter how poor or flea infested they were. There are many testimonials on this thread now from other vet techs and from people who's vets were kind enough to share this method with them. 

WHEN DOSING YOUR ANIMALS: Always do it between the shoulders(especially for cats, they froth like crazy if they can reach to lick it), or for dogs you can do it down their back. Cats tends to salivate a lot and look agitated because their first instinct is to try and lick it off. From a first hand account, it tastes horrible and you can't help but drool and foam at the taste. Your animal is only TRULY over dosed if they are foaming profusely, disoriented, and/or seizing. Seek IMMEDIATE veterinary care. Some cats may experience hairloss at the site of application, the hair will come back. If they get a scab(and it's a nasty scab) at the site of application, treat will a topical antibiotic and don't use the medication again.

OVERDOSING WILL NOT OCCUR IF YOU FOLLOW THE DOSAGE GUIDELINES.

Hopefully this was helpful and will save you a few dollars!

",404,79,133,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/y27if/i_just_saved_1000_on_an_auto_repair_that_i_did/,"My 1989 Nissan pickup truck had a pretty serious oil leak. (think Exxon Valdez) I tried to see where it was coming from, but I didn't have a jack and I was I afraid to drive it anywhere for fear that I would seize the engine after all the oil drained out. I ended up having it towed to a shop (I have AAA). 

So the shop tells me I have a cracked transmission (manual trans) housing, they want $350 for a used housing, plus about $700 in labor. The truck is only worth about $600-$1000, it's got 275K miles on it and while it runs like a champ, it looks really rough. 

So there is no way I'm going to invest $1,000 into this thing, but I have to figure out what I'm going to do with it. I offer to give it to my mechanic in exchange for the $40 diagnosis he gave me. He doesn't want it (that should tell you how rough this truck looks). 

So then I go to my neighbor, he's got the exact same make/model year truck. I tell him I'll sell him the truck for $50, he can use it as a parts vehicle. He politely declines. 

I figure I'll deal with it later, at some point I'm bouncing around youtube and I come across a video (totally randomly, I wasn't searching for this) of a guy who fixed his cracked transmission case with JB Weld. His case appeared to be almost cracked in half, and his repair worked great. 

Worth a shot! - So borrow a jack and some stands, get the truck up and I slide under it. Low and behold there it is, a hole about the size of a dime, right at the very bottom of the housing, looks like I probably hit a rock or something, just right. So I spray on some degreaser, clean up all the oil and get out my dremel tool, rough up the surface, and then mix up the JB weld. It goes on great and I let it harden up over night. The next day I pour in the oil and drive around, come back and parked on top of some cardboard. I wait a day, and no drips, I've been driving the truck like that everyday for a few weeks. Looks like the JB weld is doing its job. 

**Edit:** Thanks to **dasstrooper** and **Ness2k** for the heads up, I need to drain and replace my transmission oil as a result of this (I thought the oil leaking out of the truck was engine oil and that the transmission shared the same oil reservoir as the engine, nope, I was wrong and thanks to these two redditors, I'm going to save my transmission by draining and refilling it with the appropriate oil tomorrow.

About a week or so ago, I was posting the daily free MP3 and Android App over at another forum when someone thanked me--then said that they passed the links onto their family.

This gave me an idea: make it far more accessible.

Permalinks to the free stuff that I would update every day, with easy and clear URLs.  A centralized Facebook page, open to everyone, that would prove to be a safe and easy to access home for the project.  There's also a RSS feed, which you see in the intro.

As well, I only intend on updating (from here on out, I've been taking recommendations from the early test subjects) with the Free MP3 and Free App of the Day, and the very occasional announcement.  No spam, no fluff, nothing you don't want to see.

Also, if an app completely blows (today's, mSecure, has major security problems, and requires bloatware on the PC) I'll recommend a free alternative that's better (in this case, KeePassDroid).

It seems like a good idea, a simple idea.

**Now, as I'm excited to get this thing off the ground I've decided to do a little giveaway.  On July 4th, I'll give an Amazon gift cert (up to $200) to one lucky follower.  The catch?  The gift cert is worth $0.02 per fan.**

Yes, it's a dumb play on words.

So join the conversation, let me know if there's anything I can do to improve the idea.  I appreciate feedback, and it can help me make this whole thing even better.

Completely overwhelmed we made big payments when we could, but we never really felt in control until we sat down created a budget using Excel and went the Dave Ramzy method switching to cash / envelope system. While switching to cash has been helpful in making it tangible the real deal is actually budgeting. We work our total income every pay period down to zero, and that is what made it possible for us to understand and make CC payments with confidence. We erased 4 credit cards down to 0 and let me tell that snowball effect is incredibly noticeable. Knocking off one at a time made it something we could really work toward instead of the whole big ball of debt. We just made our last payment on what was once called the Wedding Credit Card. We took advantage of two 0 percent 0 balance transfer fees offers to keep our interest payments low throughout. 

While we cut out foolish spending, we also made sure to budget and save for us at the save time so our countdown to zero wasnt all bad and we made sure to save for eating out and vacations. But we budgeted and saved for re-occuring and sometimes ad hoc, surprise payments so random things didnt set us back like car maintenance, property tax, medical stuff, etc. I really think that's the key at least it was for us.

We have lived in our apartment for nearly 3 years now.  I have ALWAYS questioned our energy usage.  Gas not so much, we have a gas dryer and gas water heater and we cloth diaper.  So I knew I was running the dryer more than normal.  (I can't hang our clothes or diapers to dry here.)

But even with using the central air I could not believe our bills were reaching $350 a month.  2 bedroom, tiny apartment in San Diego.  In the winter we use our wood fireplace instead of the heater (Plus the upstairs neighbor keeps their apartment so warm in the winter it heats ours).  Still the electrical bills were incredibly high.

This summer with my husband being unemployed we said enough is enough.  My husband went out to the AC itself and pulled fuse.  Problem solved, even if tempted the AC was now non-functional.  Except we kept getting astronomical bills.  We stopped using lights and such.  Still huge bills and I saw the kw/hr going up and up.

I complained to the Gas &amp; Electric company that they were over charging us.  They swore that our usage was older equipment or the likes.

So finally one day I had my husband shut off the power to our apartment completely at the breaker.  I went down to the meters and checked.  The one labeled with our apartment number did shut off.  

Then I decided to write down the meter number itself and compare that to my bill.  For the last 3 years I have been paying the eletrical bill of the upstairs neighbors who run their AC/Heat ALL THE DAMN TIME.  So going into the summer their bill has been going down while ours was going up!

The Gas &amp; Electric company is still ""reviewing"" our bill but assure us we will get a refund of any overages we have paid.  They also refuse to acknowledge that they made the error, they keep giving me some line about contractors screwing stuff up.

Oh, and I had to specifically request someone come out and see the meter stuff because the Gas &amp; electric company did not want to come review it.

Anyway, I wanted to put this story out there.  If you think your electric bill is higher than it should be check that the meter that shuts off when you shut off power at the panel is correct and check that the one you are being billed for is yours.

Here's why...,407,92,160,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/axsnf/im_selfemployed_and_today_i_lost_my_last_contract/,"I got my first *real* job during the dot-com bust. I thought I'd finally made it, and then the layoffs started. I quickly realized that good things can end without warning so it's best to act accordingly.

Ten years later (age 35), we're debt-free with a good chunk of change in the bank (we could live for about 5 years without needing to work). Even though it sucks to lose a good (and basically our sole) source of income during a time when replacing it will be difficult, tonight we're celebrating that the decisions we've made to live within our means have put us in a place where we don't need to freak out.

I'm not trying to sound like an arrogant prick. I'm sharing this because sometimes it's tough to keep living within your means, especially when times are good, and I hope this will help you be confident that you're doing the right thing and that the sacrifices are worth it. You will be very glad you did at some point later on.

Cheers!

EDIT: BTW, one of the best things I did was make a New Year's resolution in 2009 to buy nothing new - only second-hand. That does two important things: 1) Removes the ability to buy things because you just want immediate gratification (most things you really, really want aren't on Craigslist), and 2) Saves you a shitload of money.

I used to have my fees waived by automoatically transferring $25 from my checking into savings every month.  

&gt;Dear Wells Fargo,

&gt;I would like to know the process of transferring funds from this account to a different accout at another bank.  Also, I would like the information on the process of closing an account.

&gt;I am deeply disappointed in the e-mail I have just received about your change in policy.  I've been keeping up with the news of all the bad press about how ""Big Banks"" are stealing from regular people like myself and many of your customers.  This has especially been true of Bank of America.  My family has been with you for years, and so far, the service you have provided me has been satisfactory.  

&gt;But now you are telling me you will be charging me fees for holding MY money?  MY money that YOU are spending and reinvesting for YOUR profits?  I barely gain any interest on my savings account, and none on my checking.  How dare you charge me $10 a month so you can spend it however you like.  I didn't mind that I had to have a minimum transfer to a savings account in order to waive fees.  I didn't mind that I had to only use your ATMs to avoid ATM fees.  But you are now coercing your customers into opening a line of credit or a minimum balance of $1,500?  That is ridiculous.  Especially for those who do not have jobs during this economic downturn.  I am lucky that I have a stable job.  And perhaps I would be able to keep a $1,500 balance on my account.  But on principle, I can no longer be your customer.  I will also be recommending to my family members to switch banks.  I also hope other customers will do the same.


I'm thinking of switching to Charles Schwabb.  Do you guys have reason why I shouldn't?

Edit:  Thanks for the support and information guys.  I'm surprised this little rant somehow got to front page of r/Frugal.  I get it.  You want me to join a CREDIT UNION.  

So from what I learned for choosing against Charles Schwab:

* Credit unions offer higher interest rates and a credit card
* ~~ It is owned by Wells Fargo~~ I guess it's not owned by Wells Fargo
* CREDIT UNIONS R BEST!!!

I'll look into credit unions in my area.  It just seems really overwhelming of all the different choices and CS seems most convenient for me.  Thanks again.

But my favorite quote from him actually has nothing to do with science, religion, philosophy, or anything so sophisticated. It is a simple manifesto for daily life:

*""We act as though comfort and luxury were the chief requirements of life, when all that we need to make us happy is something to be enthusiastic about.""*

I think that ignorance of this simple principle (and, even worse, an active cultivation of that ignorance by the advertising industry) is at the heart of the consumer culture that is driving this country deeper into debt.

We humans seem to be hard-wired to seek novelty and change. One of the worst things most of us can imagine is a life of stagnation, devoid of anything new or interesting. It's like that scene from *Groundhog Day* where Bill Murray tries to explain his predicament to a few local townspeople: ""What would you do if every day was exactly the same, and nothing you did made any difference?"" One of the men he is talking to, completely unaware of the supernatural loop the character is stuck in, responds with: ""That pretty much sums up my life."" It's a horribly depressing thought, and people who are in that condition -- or afraid of falling into it -- will do almost anything to escape it.

But, of course, we often take the easiest route out -- spending money. This is so easy because others have done the work for us; they have manufactured expensive consumer gadgets that are beatiful and exciting, or put together elaborate activities or services that look fun, and then very clever and insightful advertisers have packaged these things in ways designed to optimize their appeal to us. And all they want in exchange for this pre-packaged excitement is some of our hard-earned money.

So we give it to them. And in exchange, we get a new iPod, a larger TV, a nicer car, an enormous house or a big vacation. Now, don't get me wrong; I don't think there is anything wrong with spending money on these things if you can reasonably afford it and if it is something you will really use and enjoy. But all too often we, without even realizing it, buy them just because they are new and different -- i.e., something to get enthusiastic about -- and after the novelty has worn off, they really don't bring anything worthwhile to our lives.

And, just to be clear, I don't consider myself above this. I have been guilty of it myself more often than I would like to admit. But Einstein's words have served as a real motivation for me to try and change that, because they have made me realize that I can get that same level of enthusiasm for ""something new"" without having to spend much money -- or even any money at all.

Because ""something to be enthusiastic about"" can be an expensive new gadget, but it can also be a new recipe to try, or a project to work on, or a new friend to get to know. And I think that if more people realize that, we can take a big step towards curbing our tendency to live beyond our means.

It's more than that actuality, because he's supporting the habit of his under employed friend. 

His life is pretty stressful at the moment, and we only get to see each other monthly, so I'm not able to provide free stress relief activities (like blow jobs) on a regular basis. But holy shit, I wasn't aware of the extent of this spending, and it's tearing us apart. I save at least half of my after tax salary, don't smoke, and infrequently drink. He hasn't put much of a dent in his debts even though months ago he vowed to tackle it. 

At least it's not strip clubs... but still. Does anyone have experience with this? Am I idealistic for expecting more from a 27 year old guy? 

Edit: Honesty, $150 is just an estimate. We have only talked exact numbers twice. The first time, many months ago, he said $80. Now he says much more than that, but not over $200. But that's not factoring in his roommate's portion. I honestly would not be surprised if it was $400. I'm not convinced he knows for certain how much his hobby costs, and humans have a tendency to underestimate when it comes to spending estimates.

I only work a minimum wage job and have decided to go homeless. I work in the dining commons on campus so I decided that instead of going home, I would simply buy a laptop and stay inside the dining commons and do all my (independent) studies there while staying and eating the food for free.

I also thought I could teach friends to cook and that way I'd get to use their kitchen. 

 I will also get a gym membership for other things like shower (I work out frequently and part of the judo team). A friend also offered a car to sleep in. I'm also a polyphasic sleeper, so I only need to take 3 20 minutes naps throughout the day and a 3 hour sleep. Polyphasic sleep is actually one of the main reasons I'm switching. I'm paying 400 bucks to sleep in a place for only 3 hours. I'm also in a college town so things such as internet access, public bathrooms and such is not hard to find. I can also just brush my teeth and do my routine at any bathroom.

I figured I can get 50 of my work hours back (that's before taxes and their newly implemented retirement plan) and free up another 400+utilities/month for the summer when I get back into school. If it goes well I plan to stay like this until I graduate out of college. 

I'm very minimalist so I don't really have anything of worth except my desktop computer. I'm storing my desktop away and using the money I save from first month's rent to buy a netbook or something (I was wondering what people thought of this, it's more portable and have a much longer battery life, if anyone else has suggestions, please offer).

I figured that I didn't need the place since I only come home to use the computer and to sleep for those 3 hours and those naps. Edit: And to shower and use the toilet.

I have already lined up people to take over my lease. What do you guys think about this? I'm doing it no matter what others may say but I thought I could get some good suggestions too. For example, I was going to just store my desktop at my friends place and use it there everytime but someone suggested that I just get a netbook and use it anywhere on campus. Thanks!

**Edit:**

To make it easier of the reasons:

**Shower**: Gym Membership

**Toilet**: Any of the numerous bathrooms on campus. Or Parks.

**Brushing teeth, morning routine**: ^^

**Sleep**: Sleeps and Naps in Car, 24 Hour Lounges, Apartment Study Rooms, Library. I have a sleeping bag also to cover myself in the car.

**Internet**: Anywhere (College Town), Pretty much any apartment complex or anywhere on campus.

**Eat**: Work and cook with friends (To use kitchen), Dorm Kitchen

Also to clarify:
I'm $2000 dollars in CC debt, and $10,000 in College Loans. 

**Edit 2**: Also I just wanted to say that Frugal is my favorite subreddit and I've really cut down on many things from reading here. Thanks everybody for making Frugal awesome!

**Edit 3:** I just got a message about not being able to do it and I believe I can. For background information, I lived in a household where my mother was schizophrenic and unemployed and I have worked ever since I was in the sixth grade. In senior year high school, I took 7 classes, (averaged 3 APs) worked 20 hours a week, and took an extra 10 units of community college. I also help pay my mother's bills currently. I appreciate all the criticism you can give me however. It'll only make me stronger. 

**""Pain is temporary. It may last a minute, or an hour, or a day, or a year, but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place. If I quit, however, it lasts forever.” - Lance Armstrong**

**Edit 4**: Thanks for everyone's advice and criticisms. I won't be following this post anymore except to specific replies but I wanted to learn what troubles may come of it, how prepared I actually am, others who have done it, and how impractical people think it is. Thanks everyone and keep on your frugal habits (And enjoy life while you're at it). 

(Also for anyone against, there's nothing stopping me from getting a room again if it becomes that awful and counterproductive.)

If I understand it right, for big manufacturers it is worth it to sell the same product as two brands. One cheap, one expensive. It is not worth it, however, to **produce** two different products for these brands. 

Some shops' own brands are often produced at the same place as another, more expensive, more famous brand. Does it worth it to actually put effort into making a difference in quality? Apparently not.

Important though, that some products are actually different even from the same manufacturer. I found that syrups in particular do taste different (diluted?). Canned corn, carrot, canned fruit, various sauces, oils, what have you are noticeably the same. Sometimes even the packaging is obviously the same, only the labels are different.

I was surprised upon learning of this, as it made little sense to me, but upon reading up on finance, it sounds perfectly believeable.
