1368488130.0,246,self.talesfromcallcenters,1ea1ip,"""The Naruto Headband"", or, ""The Best Worst Interview, Ever.""",280,34,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/1ea1ip/the_naruto_headband_or_the_best_worst_interview/,"I want to begin by stating that the call center I work at is seriously top notch.  We pay extremely well, we have crazy flexible hours and we pride ourselves in our local reputation.  

Part of this is because of our **extremely deliberate hiring process.**  We get about 100 applicants every week, of whom we will end up hiring 3 to 5.   

We really don't hire *just anyone*, and as a company, we take a great deal of pride in that.  
So do our clients, all of whom are really high-profile, on a national scale.

So, this morning, my boss, Al, called me into his office and asked me to conduct my very first interview.

Now, I'd very recently accepted a promotion to trainer  - so recently, in fact, that I'm not even done with my training - but interviews are the purview of managers and shift supervisors.  I mentioned as such, but Al told me that this was a 'special case.'  

""We are counting on you,"" Al said with tremendous, *tremendous* gravity.  ""[OurCompany]'s reputation depends on our hires, Derpleberry.  I expect a great deal from you.""    

With that, he handed me a clipboard with a list of questions and a pen and ushered me into another manager's office to wait for my very first-ever interviewee.

About three minutes later, the kid walked in.

Oh my god, did he ever walk in.

I am going to take my time about describing this kid, because I do not want to leave a single thing out.

(And please, keep in mind, like everywhere else, we require **business casual** and there is no way this kid got this far in the hiring process without being told at least **three times.**)

He was wearing:  
* Skinny blue jeans that were so tight I could easily see tendons and bone structure, pulled down around the hips and crotch to avoid mashing his balls into paste.  
* Beat-up old Converse sneakers covered with what appeared to be homemade Rageface patches.  
* A red, hooded sweatshirt over a freaking My Little Pony t-shirt.  
* Black, lensless eyeglass frames and about six facial piercings  
* A goddamned Naturo headband.

*A goddamned Naruto Headband.*

""You're wearing a Naruto headband,"" I said.  
Now, to me, my tone said, and quite clearly, '*How the fuck did you make it past the first two stages of the vetting process, you ridiculous child?*'  

He, however, assumed that my tone meant '*Gosh, how completely appropriate!*' and said, with an expression of such sheer smuggery I wish I could adequately describe it, ""Oh, you recognize my headband.  Plus one to you! I was almost worried I'd have to deal with some lame-ass suit!""

And then, he handed me his 'resume'.

I want you to understand how very loose I am being with that word, here, because what he actually handed me was about four pages of prose beginning with the sentence ""I was born on [Date], 1988, in the small town of [suburb].""  

I stared at this fucking Facebook-profile-styled autobiography in numb shock for about five minutes while he rambled on about 'suits' and how they just don't 'get' anything about anything and I don't even fucking know.  

As I flipped through the pages, I noticed two really important things about it:

1) I had initially assumed the kid was about 18, 19 tops, but he was actually *twenty-five.*  

2) There was no work experience in it.  

Anywhere at all.  

He'd gone to college and that was it, that was his entire resume, everything else was random musings on the books, TV shows and bands he liked and what they'd taught him and how he basically felt that college was completely beneath him.  
He'd never even held a fucking paper route.

I looked up at this kid and I said, ""Do you think, maybe, you'd like to reschedule this interview for another time?""

""No.  Why? Is there a problem?""

""Yes,"" I said, ""Several.""  

I asked him if he'd received the *multiple* calls setting up and confirming the interview, all of which had stated, **very clearly** that we expected him to be dressed 'business casual', and, in fact, had **very carefully** defined what was meant by 'business casual'.

He said, ""Oh, were you serious about that?""

I had no god-damned words.  

""Well,"" he continued, in that very same *ludicrously smug* tone, ""I figured, you know, this is me.  This is who I am.  If you can't 'deal' with that, then maybe I don't even **want** this job.""

""That's extremely convenient,"" I said.  ""Because I don't see any reason to continue this interview.""

""Well great!"" he said with a gigantic smirk.  ""When do I start?""

What.  Holy unbelievable fucking Jesus Christ almighty, what the explosive fuck, ***what***.  I am staring at this ridiculous man-child and there is zero irony on his pierced, fake-glasses-wearing face, he is patiently waiting for me to tell him when his first day of work will be and I still cannot stop staring at that fucking Naruto headband.

""You don't,"" I managed to say.  ""You don't start here.  Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.  When I said 'this interview is over', I did not mean that in a good way.  ""

He is still not understanding.  ""But you didn't even ask me anything,"" he says.  ""There wasn't even an interview.""

""Yes,"" I said and explained to him that our request for him to dress like a professional adult was one hundred percent mandatory, and by failing to do so, so very flippantly, had told me everything I needed to know about him.

""You don't know shit about me,"" this kid says and his face goes beet red.  ""You don't know me, you don't know anything about me.  You need to give me an interview.  I know my rights, give me my fucking interview.""

For the sake of not causing a physical incident, I did *not* explain that I knew more than enough about him already to warrant never ever hiring him ever in the world, forever.  Instead, I carefully explained that his 'rights' here consisted entirely of leaving the building before I had him removed for trespassing.

And now this kid starts shouting at me, screaming that I am a fascist nazi asshole, that I don't know shit about anything, that he's a billion times better than me and when he's a millionaire he'll buy this company just so he can fire me.

When that somehow fails to procure immediate employment, he then, with tears in his eyes, **begs me for a job**.  

His mother, he says, will boot him out onto the street if he doesn't get this job.  
If I don't give him this job, he will be homeless, he shouts at me, and it will be my fault.

""I'll cope,"" I tell him as security finally arrives to escort him the fuck out.

So there's me, sitting in the empty office, with this kid's ridiculous 'resume' in my lap, chairs all knocked over, staring off into space and wondering *what the fuck just happened.*

And then Al, my boss Al, pokes his head in.  His face is stony-serious as he asks me, ""What did you think?""

""You know,"" I said, ""I don't think he'll be a good fit.""

""Okay,"" Al says and nods with the kind of gravitas you don't see outside of Shakespeare.  ""Keep up the good work, Derpleberry.""

And he walks away.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**~UPDATE~**

So, today it came out that Naruto Headband was 100% for real, with a twist:  his online application and resume, the first step of the hiring process, was *completely different* than the one he gave to me, to the point where it was *very clearly* written by someone else entirely.  

His online resume also noted his lack of work experience, but very highly touted his education and extracurricular activities, in a manner that made him look very mature and professional indeed.

We're basically positive his mother wrote it for him.

That online resume was employable, that's why he got the interview.   
When he came in dressed like an alien douchemonster, he instantly had no chance of getting the job, but rather than send him home, Al sent him to me.

Not so much as a test to see how I'd respond, mostly because he thought it was *really fucking funny.*

*So, I grew up during the civil rights movement. One summer, my father and I were visiting some,uh,* work associates *of his in Alabama. We got hungry and decided to get a couple of hot dogs and sodas, so we went to a vender. We got there, and there was this African American girl (they used to call them colored girls back then) trying to get a hot dog and a soda, but the guy wouldn't sell her nothin'. She gave up and went and sat on the bench. My father was a very liberal man. He looked at the guy and said ""Give me three hot dogs and three sodas."" The guy gave him the hot dogs and sodas and my father told me to go give the little colored girl a hot dog and a soda. The guy looked pissed, right, and says to my father ""You ever heard of the KKK, son?"" My father looks him dead in the eye and says ""You ever heard of the Mafia?"" Our hot dogs and sodas were free that day.*

Be careful.,177,12,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/13dkep/i_am_in_the_same_country_be_careful/,"Ok, so I was going to post this in r/pettyrevenge or r/talesfromtechsupport but I'm not sure it fits in the rules. Plus You guys might like it more. 

So doing the regular Tech support role in a call centre. You all know how it is. Some of the job is great and you really feel good when you get a genuine nice person and you can help them and then there are the times you feel like you want to go to their house and kick their door in. 

This client I had was definitely the latter.  This guy was arrogant, rude, quick to temper and derogatory towards women. 
Apparently a woman wouldn't be as good as myself at helping him because ""They don't understand technical issues""   What a fucking twat. I never once agreed with him, I just wanted to get this moron off the phone.

We did the normal steps and I found a fault with cables out side his property. The testing was pretty conclusive and I told him we needed to book a tech. He wasn't happy at the delay but agreed. 
I booked the tech - most faults booked in Australia have a 24 - 48 hr turn around. So I booked this on a Wednesday, it should be fixed by Friday.

So Wednesday night he calls back and gets me.
""Where is the tech?""

""It's only been 4 hours since I booked it sir, it can take up to 48""

""This is bullshit, I want it working now or I want compensation""

""We can discuss compensation after the fault is resolved""

""No, we'll fucking discuss it now. I'm sick of you bastards ripping me off""

""Look, mate. There is a fault with the cable. I can't just flip a switch and fix it""

""You're all fucking useless""

This went around for about 10 minutes. He just constantly argued and abused me calling me all sorts of things. 

One thing I failed to mention in the beginning. This dude lived next door to me. So damn close that I could look over my fence and see directly into his house. 

I thought it was rather funny and coincidental but that was about it. Didn't really read much into it. 

So the following day he calls back.
""Why the FUCK isn't it fixed yet?!""

*I look up the tech notes who advised the dudes cable pit is basically destroyed but he couldn't get into it because someone was parked on it and no one was home to move the car*

I tell the dude this.
He flies into a rage. This enormous rage. Holy shit this dude was going off I actually terminated the call because I was sure my ear was starting to bleed. 

That night walking home, I look into his front yard. And sure enough there is this massive 4WD parked on the pit. 
""Fuck it"" I thought to myself.

I went and knocked on his door (This was at 8pm at night)

He answered the door looking pretty pissed off. 

""I don't want what your selling""

""I'm not selling anything.""

""What the hell do you want then""

""I wanted to show you two quick things""

""What?""

""It's in relation to your line faults""

""What? Who are you?""

""I work at (ISP). Can I show you something""

""Fine, it's a bit late for this crap isn't it""

""It will only take a moment""

He follows me outside where I point at his pit.

""That is why a tech couldn't fix your issue. Someone parked on the damn pit""

""That's not my problem""

""I assure you it is, because if I sent another tech out they will charge you if the car is still there""

""Fine, I'll move the fucking car. What was the other thing you wanted to tell me""

""Be careful who you damn well abuse over the phone, cause you never know where they live""
At that point I walked to my front yard and opened my door. 
His face went white. 
I then proceeded to open my windows and blast incredibly loud music until the council approved cut off time. 

The next call I got from him was remarkably calm and collected and he was very polite. 

Every time I walked home after that and saw him out the front I got a wave and a ""G'day mate""

Sorry, that turned out a bit longer then I expected. :/

1373691978.0,162,self.talesfromcallcenters,1i7bwf,I have been given explicit permission from my bosses to troll prank callers. I may have abused this privilege.,190,28,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/1i7bwf/i_have_been_given_explicit_permission_from_my/,"I work for an answering service.  It's lovely good work, but it's third shift.  I get a surprising number of prank calls at that hour on various accounts.  

Who *prank calls* a friggin' funeral home?

Anyway, a few months ago it got so bad that I went to my bosses and asked what the consequences would be if I were to start getting one back for the home team.  They said, flatly, 'they're committing a crime and so long as you stay within the legal statutes set up by the federal government and the state, you can do whatever you want to them'.  

Oooh, boy.  Imagine this little girl cackling in her employer's office and you'll have some idea of my response. 

So, I looked *up* those statutes and it turns out so long as you're not threatening or obscene to someone under-age, there *aren't* very many limits on what you can do if someone prank calls you.  Being as I am an upstanding child of the internet, I couldn't let this go.  So I made a list.

The first night, I'm revved and ready.  At my station, headset on, PRAYING for a call.  

Finally, just after midnight, a giggling twelve year old with her friends in the background.  

""Hiii, do you have big boobs?""

""Hiii, do you know that it's a federal crime to prank call across state lines? I have your caller ID number.  I'm tracing your house, as we speak.  The police will be there within ten minutes to arrest you and your parents.""  

*click.*  

I hung up on her.  Five minutes pass.  Call on the same line.

""I'm so *sorry*...please... please don't call the police...""

This, as it turned out, was just fine with my bosses.  

I decided escalation was in order, but no prank calls came in for several days.  When one finally did, I was ecstatic.  I was *ready*.  

""You wanna suck my cock?"" said the tittering fourteen year old boy.  

""Sorry, I'm having trouble hearing you.  Could you put me on speaker?""  

This gullible shit actually did it.  I heard that shift in tone that indicates going on speaker phone.

I lean over to my computer, flick on Youtube, turn the 'send' volume up as high as I possibly can on my mic, and turn on 'Gay Bar' by Electric Six.  

Five seconds later, there's shouting and the sound of his phone hitting the ground, then static and silence. 


Last night was the culmination.  I'm worried I may have crossed a line.  

Call comes on one of our accounts that shares a six digits with the local Pizza Hutt of this town in Bumfuck, Ohio.  We get almost nothing BUT pranks on this line.

""Yo!  Wassup, wassup, my nigs?  You got de good stuff, yo boooyyyyeeee?  I got your stuff riiiight here, girly!  You wanna go roll wit' me, get pounded by somma dis niiice dick?""  

The person saying this cannot be more than fifteen years old...and very, *very* white.  His friends burst into laughter behind him.

""Could you hold for one second?  I'll be right back!""

Surprisingly enough, most prank callers are dumb enough to hold.  They LOVE getting your reactions.  

I calmly, quietly, reach over and open the White Pages free reverse look up.  Bless you, whoever came up with that.  It doesn't work for most cells, but sweet heavens, if they're stupid enough to ring in on a landline.  This is especially true of these bored kids calling from tiny towns.  Usually, their only option is their parent's landline.

He was listed...and his Facebook was set to 'public'.  

Names have been changed to protect the innocent.  

""I'm sorry, Justin Browder of Number Sixteen, Arrow Root Court, Bumfuck, Ohio, five five four four three, child of Patricia and Erin Browder, attendee of Bumfuck High School.  How is Miss Pleasanton's Fifth period class?  You sound like you could use an English Tutor.""

Total, deathly silence.  

""...not... cool...""  Someone said in the back ground, then the line clicked.  

I'm ending this game because I really don't want to see how far my boss's tolerance will stretch...but if I could start a company whose sole job was to take prank calls, I would.

Some nights, when I got off earlier and wasn't bogged down with closing duties, I'd take the same bus home as one of my agents, B. He was a really nice guy, and also quite large, so he made a great companion for late-night travel. Best of all, he was always full of the most hilarious and bizarre stories from his previous job as a tech-support guy (for a third-party Apple repair company). This tale was the most outlandish of all.

A guy called in and before ""Good day sir, how may I be of assistance to you?"" even left B's lips, this guy interrupted him and shouted the following:

""Okay, here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna refund me in full for this piece of shit Mac computer, pay to replace the lining of my fucking swimming pool and then... you're paying for my dog's funeral!""

Obviously dumbfounded, B paused and then asked the man to explain exactly what had happened (because, what the hell?).

Turns out, while this guy was hanging out in his backyard on a hot day, he placed the desktop computer *on the diving board of his swimming pool*, and left it unattended there while he went inside to answer a call. His dog was swimming in the pool. As you might expect when one tempts fate with such careless, idiotic ideas, it inevitably got knocked into the pool, completely destroying the computer and pool lining and, sadly, killing the dog. You can't make this shit up, folks. Unless he did to try and scam them, but why would anyone try to pass *that* story of all the possible stories in the world?

B calmly explained that they could not do any of those things for him and let him know, as politely as possible, that he was completely at fault for using the machine in.... a manner that is, uh, generally not recommended. 

The guy yelled and ranted some more and then finally said something to the tune of ""Fuck you, I'm never buying an Apple product *ever again*.""

Without missing a beat, B said ""Sir, for the sake of everyone's safety, I highly recommend that you don't.""

He hung up.

I've worked in call centres for 8+ years. Held a ton of different roles and worked for about 4 different companies. 
This particular tale happened when I was a Sales Team Leader for a crappy little Australian ISP. 
When I say crappy - I mean crappy. Upper management had recently made changes which caused the Sales, Customer Service, Tech Support and Call Centre Manager to quit. So basically the Team Leaders were running the show until new staff were hired. 

So - to the tale. 
Our call centre was that crappy that anyone calling who needed tech support was generally waiting 2 days to speak to someone. 
This meant that the sales and customer service teams copped a lot of the flack. Generally people asking to be put directly through to someone, not wanting to be called back, etc. A lot of the time they were pretty annoyed but rarely became abusive.
Until this one douchebag called in.
This colossal fuckstick called in and from the greeting of my staff member he lost it. 

As a team leader I had the ability to monitor calls as they were happening, I saw my guy (Lets call him D) become a little flustered so I listened in. 

The customer was swearing like I had never heard before. He called D several things like - Scum, fucking cunt, useless chink, faggot, slope (And many more racist things). 
I was red in the face at this point but while the call was taking place I had the customers account up and I was getting as informed as I could before I took over the call. 

D started to really stress out and accidentally muttered ""shit"" under his breath. I could see his face, he was immediately afraid he would lose his job. The customer heard it and demanded to speak to a TL. 

This is when I just jumped in on the call and muted D.

The prick on the phone wanted a written apology and 3 free months of access because he was abused. 
I was ""Uh huh""ing and ""of course"" just to see how far he would go. 

Once he finished I gave my ""counter offer"" as it were..

""Ok, you'll be getting none of that.""

""WHAT?""

""I heard what you called my staff member you fucking disgusting prick, you are by far the most vile piece of shit I have ever heard. Racist remarks towards my staff? How dare you. You are fucking lucky these calls aren't recorded otherwise I would be sending in this call to the police. In fact, I've actually cancelled your account and black listed your name and address. You will never get service from us again, and if you try to call up and get someone else a nice big alert will pop up on there screen saying you are a racist scumbag. Does abusing someone over the phone make you feel big, mate? Well, one last piece of advice for you. Don't abuse people who have access to your address, name, phone number and most of all, your credit car details. Good bye.""

I then ended the call. 
Turned out as I was in my rant, D had put it on speaker phone and the rest of my team and the other team leaders heard what I had said. 
I fully expected to get reported for that, but I didn't. I got cheers and laughter from the other staff and became known as the TL with a temper. 

I left that place not long after. But because we were not monitored from upper management there were a lot of other weird stories like that.",,False,self,t5_2urem,False,,,True,t3_12xlg3,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/12xlg3/dont_swear_at_my_staff/,

All figures have been changed and rounded for easier story telling

I was evaluating a claim that came in. Fairly standard, our party hit another party in the rear. This means our party is required to pay an excess.  
I was looking through this guy's history and find that he's a pretty terrible driver. License suspended 6 months ago, a DUI 6 months before that and 4 at fault claims in the last 5 months. For those not too familiar with insurance, that adds up to high premiums and high excess. This guy's was something in the realm of $2,000.

So I call him up to let him know ""no problems, we're happy to cover you and just hope you'll drive a little safer for yourself"". We go through the whole situation and finally come to his excess.

Me: Okay so your excess is $2,000 and that will be payable to the repairer once your vehicle is fixed

Customer: $2,000? I was told $200

Me: I do apologise, the agent you were dealing with did not take into account your substantial driving history. If you read your policy schedule, it clearly outlines any costs and additional excesses that will apply

C: That's bullshit. I got it in writing and all!

M: Not a problem, if you have it in writing from us or our agent, please send a copy in and we'll be happy to honour it

C: Nah, I can't do that, then I won't have the paper anymore

M:...Do you have access to a photocopier or scanner?

C: Yeah, scanner

M: If you can scan it and send an email to *email address* we can honour this letter you have

C: Nah, I aint doing that. I'm only paying $200

M: I can understand you being frustrated, if it's a matter of not having the excess right now, that's not an issue. We can put the file on hold

C: Nope I'm paying $200

M: I appreciate your concern regarding the costs, but unfortunately I cannot reduce the excess.

C: Okay then, I want to cancel my insurance

M: Not a problem, would you also like to withdraw this claim?

C: Of course, I aint paying you fuckers for nothing

M: No worries, I just need to confirm again that you are withdrawing this claim and want me to send a confirmation of this

C: What, you don't care?

M: To be perfectly honest, your choice is your choice. I am not legally qualified to provide you specific advice on your insurance choice, however I would recommend that you don't withdraw this claim and pay the excess

C: Nope, I'm cancelling right now unless you waive the excess and discount my costs next year

M: In that case I'll just send through the withdrawal confirmation now, can I confirm your email or postal address is *address*

C: Hell nawww, you don't care? You're gonna leave me with a wrecked car

M: This is entirely your choice, sir. I would highly recommend not withdrawing your claim, however you have made it quite clear there is nothing I can do for you. Once I have withdrawn your claim I will pass you through to customer service where they can cancel your policy, as per your request.

C: Alright, alright I don't want to cancel.

M: So you're going to pay the excess and continue with this claim?

C: Yeah, sure. So when is my car getting fixed?

M: In approximately 2 weeks, I have booked this for you

C: Good, Imma get my car fixed then not pay the bullshit excess so fuck you

*C ends call and hangs up*

M: Oh no. He has hung up before I can tell him that the repairers won't release his car until he pays them the excess and it's right on lunch time. I really hope I remember to call him back after lunch

The center I work in handles almost every aspect of the business via phone, live chat and email. I normally do live chats (2 at once) but one night three weeks ago we experienced a spike in call volumes and was moved onto the phones. I've taken a lot of calls and chats from differently normal people, but this one was slightly over the top.

Having been yanked from my cosy, text-based normality I was already irritated at having to don a headset and treat the punters like human beings. The night in question was freakishly busy, with all kinds of ridiculous requests flying around and people losing their shit about once every ten minutes. The supervisors were running around in little circles trying to stay calm and management was on conference calls with the head office inquiring exactly what the actual fuck was going on. My little team of phone reps stayed frosty, though, and fielded our calls with aplomb. Eventually the lines started slowing down and we took a deep breath, confident that we could relax.

My phone rang. Swearing, I accepted the call and launched into my greeting: ""thank you for calling XXX blah blah blah""

""MY NAME IS XXX AND I AM AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER""

Fuck. This is going to be a long, painful call. Deep breath, sip of tea and go:

""I'm so sorry to hear you're unhappy with our service. Could you tell me a littme more about what's happened?""

""ONE OF YOUR SUPERVISORS HAS BEEN CALLING ME CONTINUALLY FOR DAYS NOW FROM A DISPOSABLE CELLPHONE. HE HAS CALLED ME A LITTLE BITCH AND A CUNT, AND SAID HE IS COMING TO FIND ME, CHOP UP MY BODY AND MAIL THE PARTS TO MY MOTHER. I HAVE CONTACTED THE POLICE AND FBI ABOUT YOUR COMPANY'S SHAMEFUL EMPLOYEES AND DEMAND TO BE COMPENSATED FOR THIS OUTRAGE."" 

Ah, my favourite word. Keep in mind, the caller is not only slurring and seems to have trouble forming a sentence, but is calling from a Google Voice number that can't be traced (as far as I know). I pull up his notes and see that every order he's made has been declined, and he has made over a hundred calls with the same story. He goes on to demand a $57 credit for the trauma that he's gone through. Seemed like a very specific number so I check his past orders and confirm: three items at $18.99 each. Ah, yes. Nothing but the truth, right? Now the horns come out. I move my headset closer to my mouth and say in my most commanding voice:

""XXX, I see that you've called repeatedly about this same issue. We have listened to the calls and found that every one of our agents has told you the same thing. Please contact our legal department as we will no longer be able to help you.

""I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER BECAUSE YOU WANT TO KILL ME. I WILL FIND YOU AND I WILL CRUSH YOUR HEAD LIKE A MOTHERFUCKING BALLOON AND THEN I WILL FUCK YOUR NECKHOLE""

I couldn't help it. Burst out laughing like a hyena. He dropped the call, eventually called back and got to a manager. She told him she'd have him arrested for libel if he called back.

One day, I get a phone call from a woman in her mid 40s. She sounds pissed off already. The exchange went something like this:



Lady: I need to speak with the representative that's been helping me.

Me: Not a problem, may I get the first and last name on the account?

Lady: Doe.
Me: Okay, may I get the first name?

Lady: *sighs and exhales deeply* JOHN!!!!

(she literally screamed this)

Me: and the zip code?

Lady: Oh my god, are you serious? I'm just trying to get to my husbands representative because you guys NEVER call me back.

Me: I understand, mam, but I don't know the name of your representative and I need the account information so I can find out which representative is listed in your account. 

Lady: You know what, I want to talk to your supervisor. I don't wanna talk to just a gatekeeper like you.

Me: My supervisor is unavailable at the moment, even then, he wouldn't be able to do much. He supervisors the customer serv-

Lady: FUCK YOU!!!
*disconnects the call*

So I get super pissed off and make sure I notate EVERYTHING that just happened. I'm going through the tons of previous notes in her husbands account, and it never fails. Every single time she calls in, she pulls the same routine. Doesn't want to provide account information, doesn't know the name of their rep, gets upset that we ask for the information, then hangs up without getting anything done.

dafuq??!

Anyway, I'm continuing my day when a couple of hours later, I get a call and answer with my script. IT'S THE SAME LADY. I get the biggest grin on my face. After the same exact routine she did earlier, I see notes in the account from the representative she was trying to reach earlier. We are terminating her husband as a customer because of his wife constantly calling in and belittling, cussing at, being rude, and just generally being mean to EVERYONE she spoke to. This makes my grin even bigger.

Lady: I'm going to get a lawyer and go to another company because you guys can't do shit right.

Me: Mam, there are notes from your representative on the account, and it looks like we are no longer going to work with you as a customer.

Lady: What? -moment of silence- I want to talk to your supervis-

Me: This decision was made in conjunction with a supervisor and high level executives of the company. We are no longer working with you due to the obscene insults you make towards our employees and you are free to contact any lawyer you wish. Have a good day!

I enjoy it sometimes and hate it now and then, but all in all it's just a job.  It's something to do between the times when life happens.  

Tonight, the job gave me a tiny twinge of happiness.

I used to answer for a major company up north that sold cheeses, sausages, and pies from a mail order catalog.  They don't exist anymore, sadly, but we still get calls from their former customers now and then.  Most of them are older people who haven't heard the company closed down.  We maintain their phone lines, even a year later, just to let people know. 

It was quiet tonight, on third shift.  Real quiet.  I hadn't taken an actual call in an hour or more.  I get a ring in on the line for this cheese and sausage company, and pick up.  

There's this sweet old lady on the line with a middle Iowa area code.  I'm paraphrasing, since it was a long conversation.  

Her: ""Morning.  Can I place an order?""

Me: ""I'm sorry, ma'am.  The company closed down, a little less than a year ago.""

Her: ""Oh.  I'm sorry to hear that.""

Me: ""Yeah, I was too.  We still answer for them, but just to let people know.""

Her: ""That's alright.""  

She pauses, and I hear her breath catch.  I've got time and there aren't any calls coming in, so I decide 'Why not?'

Me:""Are you okay, ma'am?""

Her:""My husband used to order me a pecan pie every year for my birthday from (the company) for the last fifteen years since I had to close the bakery.  My hands shake, so I can't bake no more.  Big ol' pecan pie.  He passed this year.""

Me:""I don't know what it's like to lose someone like that.  I'm so sorry, ma'am.  I wish I could send you a pecan pie.  I'm not much of a baker.""

Her:""It's alright, kiddo.  I mostly just wanted someone to talk to.  My birthday is today.  I'm turning 89.  My kids won't be up or around for a few hours, the little shits.""

She laughs and it's one of those grindy sounds like when you over-rev an old engine.  

Me:""Well, nobody is calling in just now.  I've got a minute.  I'm a fan of pecan pies, myself.  Pecan pie, little whipped cream, and a tall drink of sweet tea.  Nothing better.""

From there, we sat and talked weather, my boyfriend, desserts, and her husband for about fifteen minutes.  I wish I could have been there to sit on her porch somewhere and eat pecan pie and visit all afternoon.  

Finally, another call came in and I had to get off the line, but afterwards I started to smile to myself and at the callers.  Even the ones who were real dicks.  Maybe, even in a job with the kind of drudgery this one has, there is something valuable.

&gt; hear call tone, look at my phone, it's a TAG transfer...should not have happened, but whatevs

&gt; Go through standard greeting, prepare to xfer them back to the consumer queue

&gt; Rather than hearing ""Hi, I need help with blah blah blah"" I'm greeted with ""ARE YOU AMERICAN IN AMERICA?"" from what I assume is a woman

&gt; ""Yes I am.  I am in the midwest."" I replied

&gt; ""GOOD, THOSE (racial slur removed) I HAD TO LISTEN TO TRY AND GET HELP FROM WERE JUST SO STUPID.  HOW DO YOU WORK WITH PEOPLE LIKE THAT?"" with an extremely thick ""New York"" accent

I could have terminated the call the first time she used derogatory language.  I regret not doing so.

&gt;I'm sorry about that, how can I help you?

&gt; ""MY SON FOUND THE PROBLEM, NOBODY WOULD LISTEN TO HIM BEFORE, BUT YOU SOUND SMART, SO YOU CAN HELP HIM""

&gt; ""uh, OK.  What kind of problem are you having?""

&gt; before I finish she hands the phone over to a very young boy (maybe middle school at the oldest)

&gt; ""You need to fix this immediately"" are the first words out of his pie hole

&gt; ""What is the problem"" I ask again

&gt; ""The desktop isn't in 3D""

&gt; ""yeah, that is standard behavior.  What can I help you with?""

&gt; ""no, I have an ATI 9700 PRO""

&gt; glance down at Siebel, there is no such video card from us in that horrible, horrible desktop boat anchor

&gt; ""OK, well I'm seeing here that you have a base configuration that uses the onboard video""

And in order to meet the cost constraints for the contract with HSN these systems **DID NOT HAVE AN AGP EXPANSION SLOT**

&gt; ""I put in a better card"" he shoots back

&gt; ""OK, well, let me get some more information about the system then""

&gt; ""Why can't you just fix it?  My desktop should be in 3D now, I bought the card, it was very expensive.  It cost my dad over $500.""

&gt; I was about to kick his ass back to the consumer queue when he started berating me

&gt; ""I'm getting an A+ in my computer class.  I am the smartest kid in my class, and I demand you make this work.  You should be lucky that my dad is not there having you fired right now.  He is very rich and can do that.  You have to do what I say, right now.""

After that pours out of the little angels mouth, my boss fell out of her chair laughing.  She had picked me for QA on this bastard of a call ಠ_ಠ

&gt; damn...how can I smile on the phone after that little nugget?

&gt; Just as I start to reply with ""Well, if you won't help me help you, I can't do anything further"" he started again

&gt; ""You obviously are stupid.  You can't even tell me how to make my desktop in 3D.  I'm getting an A+ in my computer class at school, I show the teacher how to fix the computers.  I am smarter than you.""

&gt; I look to my manager, she is giving me the go-ahead to drop the call

&gt; ""I'm sorry, however you refuse to work with me.  If I am going to be able to fix your problem, I first need to know the entire scope of the issue.  So far you have refused to tell me what you want to fix other than something that is not broken.  If you want support for legitimate issues, please don't hesitate to contact us.  However you cannot be rude to us when you call.  We're not here to be abused""

&gt; stunned silence on the other end of the line

&gt; 30 seconds pass, so I start the countdown to the hang up

&gt; just as I am about to drop the call the woman comes back on the line

&gt; she's enraged, all kinds of racial slurs come flying over the line, then she drops the ""L"" word - lawsuit.

&gt; my manager brings down her mic and takes over - instantly telling the caller that there would be no further insults or threats.  She told the caller that all further contacts with the company would have to be done through the legal department until the lawsuit issue was settled.

&gt; caller starts to backpedal, but the damage is done - Hateway recorded every single call, every single time.

&gt; manager had my back completely - feelsgoodman.bmp

&gt; it's 22:00 on the dot now, time for me to head home

&gt; log out of the queue, manager tells me that she is sorry I had to deal with it, don't take it personally, etc.

Eventually the call was used as proof that TAG (The Awful Group) was swinging huge numbers of calls while claiming they could handle all call volume, for all product lines.  Sadly that was not a problem because in 2004 Hateway fired all support techs and outsourced all support to TAG anyway.

We do landlines, internet, and TV. The vast majority of our calls are about bills in some fashion.

So, this guy calls up and starts complaining about how high his bill is. This is an unfortunately common call. Mind, what's not so common is that, the last few months, he was paying $10/mo for his highspeed internet. Considering our smallest internet plan is $40/mo, he should consider himself lucky. I started getting pissed and a bit ranty.

At first, we discussed why his bill had been lower (he'd been given a temporary promotional pricing because something hadn't gone right six months ago), and then discussed his conversation yesterday. Apparently, he'd talked to our Loyalty department (also known as cancellations), and with their refusal to give him rock bottom prices, had set up an order to cancel his service at the end of this billing cycle. So, I knew that I had no obligation to lower his prices. If he couldn't come to acceptable terms with Loyalty, then that was that. I had to either convince him that the prices were, in fact, reasonable, or let him go.

So, then we got into a discussion about why the internet was so expensive in the first place. Keep in mind, we're in western Canada - we've got massive stretches of land up here, lots of rural people out in the middle of nowhere, a low population density, and a lot of wiring to replace.

When he asked why the internet was so expensive, I told him about how the CRTC (Canada's telecommunications regulation people) mandated that everyone in Canada be able to purchase HS internet by 2015, and so our company (as well as our competitor) have been working hard to expand our HS infrastructure.

And he says, ""I don't care about that. I'm not paying for someone else to have internet. I only want to pay for my internet.""

Me: ""Sir, it doesn't work that way. For starters, you aren't paying for other people to have internet - you're paying into a system that, by it's nature and by the nature of the laws of the land, must expand. Someone must foot that bill.""

Him: ""Well, it ain't gonna be me.""

Me (getting frustrated, been a long day): ""If I may, sir, who do you think should pay that bill, exactly?"" (obviously, his internet price includes other aspects, like my salary, but this is the aspect we got stuck on.)

Him: ""Obviously, whoever's getting the internet.""

Me: ""Are you suggesting that you feel it fair to ask a few farmers out in the middle of nowhere to front several million dollars to build all the infrastructure between them and the cities, so that they can start to pay $40 per month for internet?""

Him: ""No, of course not.""

Me: ""Then who, exactly? The government? Then you'd be paying for it out of your taxes. And it's the government who's saying the infrastructure has to be built - we don't exactly have a choice in the matter. Someone, somewhere, has to front the bill, and we feel it appropriate to draw that funding with small amounts from a massive population.""

Him: ""Well, I'm not paying for it.""

Me: ""You don't have to. You aren't required to purchase internet from anyone, but it's because of these investments made up front that you have that option. And this is how those investments are funded.""

Him: ""It's not right that I should have to pay for other people's internet.""

Me: ""Is it likewise wrong for you to pay for it when a company invests in research and development? When you buy medication, do you feel it's wrong that you're paying for the development of new medications? Sir, this is simply how our society works. Absolutely nothing you pay for is simply for the object or service in question - the price tag includes salaries, development, rent payments... and infrastructure maintenance and expansions. That's how our entire society functions.""

Him: ""I'm not paying for other people's internet!""

Me: ""Sir, there's three options here. Either the government pays the millions it takes to expand the network, the internet customers pay, or a bunch of random rural folk are somehow forced to pay. If the government pays, then the whole country, even those who don't use the internet, must foot the bill. And we couldn't make them cover it, anyway. And both us, and our competitors, feel it would be entirely unethical to try to force a bunch of farmers to front millions for the expansion... and if they didn't, where would we be? Don't forget, the government has mandated this expansion. We can't accept ""no"" for an answer. So who does that leave?""

Him: ""Enough of this! Are you going to give me cheaper internet, or aren't you?""

Me: ""Basically... no.""

Him: ""@#$% you!""

Me: ""Thanks for your opinion. Have a great day!""

CLICK

Telling him ""no"" felt good. But I'm still brimming with frustration. Mind, at more than just him. Last few days have been annoying as hell.

Edit: I know, I should have redirected him, but I was feeling pissed at his entitlement attitude, like somehow he deserved an exemption from how our entire society funds expansion, research, etc. That's why I didn't budge.

A little backstory: The inbound call center I worked at had a problem with employees taking calls but leaving them on mute so that they could take a break while the customer thought they were still waiting in the queue. To combat this, the company implemented a system that required us to record a greeting (""Thanks for calling XYZ my name is Someone, how can I help you?"") that automatically played when the call was answered. 

One night I came on shift to find almost 300 calls in the queue. This equated to 1 hour+ wait times and a lot of (rightfully) angry customers. As expected, every call I took had an irate customer on the other end.

My co-worker and I came up with an experiment since, like all good call center workers, we were interested in human behavior. She re-recorded her getting to say, ""We at XYZ understand that your time is valuable and apologize for the extended wait. If your call is important and you need to speak to a representative right away, please press 1. Otherwise, please continue to hold and the next available representative will assist you.""

Absurd, I know. 

As she got ready to jump back into the queue I plugged my headset into her phone to listen. First call comes in and her ""improved"" greeting plays, then a moment of silence followed by what I can only describe as a hesitant beep.  She immediate un-mutes herself and says, ""Thanks for calling XYZ, how can I help you?""  We hear the customer gasp and say, ""It worked! Uh... Yes I need...""  

He was so thrilled by the idea that he had skipped the line that he forgot to be mad about the hour wait.  We let this continue for 5 more calls and each customer was an absolute pleasure to deal with. 

Worried that our boss would catch us we changed her greeting back and, of course, the customer attitudes went back to angry. 

We thought about suggesting that the company offer this ""service"" on high call volume days but we felt the public would figure out what was happening and then the backlash would be worse. 

TL;DR: We let customers think they were skipping ahead of everyone else and they forgot to be angry about waiting an hour to talk to us. ",,False,self,t5_2urem,False,,,True,t3_16blz3,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/16blz3/if_you_would_like_to_skip_the_line_press_1_an/,

When I say aging, I mean 'not replaced since the 90's' aging'.  City infrastructure needed a fix.  

They'd sent out newsletters to everyone on their customer lists, put posts in the newspaper, and had the local TV station run adverts telling everyone what was going to happen for the last month and a half.  

Power was going to be out for 6 hours, starting at 1:00 AM.  No biggie, right?  

I answer for the utility company.  For a city of a couple thousand people, there are apparently a lot of retards.  

Come one AM, we started getting calls.  A few were calling to bitch about the power being out because they couldn't get to sleep without their CPAP machines.  You know, understandable, but it's not like they weren't informed.  

The worst, by a thousand miles, was a woman who rang up who might have been in her twenties and the first words out of her mouth went like this:

Me:Hello, such-and-such Utility company, Chessiecat speaking, how can I help you?

Bitch:Turn my power back on!

Me: I'm sorry, there is scheduled maintenance on the whole of the city tonight.  Everyone's power is off.  It'll be back on at seven.

Bitch:I just bought a whole fridge worth of groceries!  What the fuck am I supposed to do? 

Me:You were sent a newsletter.  This has been in the newspaper for some weeks now.  

Bitch:You can't be serious.  

**I must pause here to include the one line which always proves to me that someone is a fucking idiot.**


""I've got a baby here!""

Me:I'm sorry, this is the information we've been given.  Power will be on at seven.  

Bitch:Turn the fucking power back on!  We're *not* going to pay our bill this month if you don't-

Now, my company has a policy.  I love this policy. 'If the customer cusses, you can hang up on them.'  Simple, sweet policy.  I love it.  

I slammed the phone on this twat-waffle right there, sat back, drank some water, and let her burn in waits until she got bored of our hold music.

1359804525.0,86,self.talesfromcallcenters,17r05w,[UPDATE] Using the restroom on company time? That's a paddling...,92,6,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/17r05w/update_using_the_restroom_on_company_time_thats_a/,"On Wednesday I was calling in for yet another meeting where my supervisor, a regional human resources person and another big HR guy (from a different state) bullied me about restroom time. 

They were using terms like work avoidance and acting like using the bathroom outside of breaks was a serious issue. I was being told, yet again, that any break time outside of my scheduled breaks was not allowed and if this trend continued I would be fired. My only option was to have a doctor apply for a medical accommodation under ADA on my behalf. 

I'm sick of this crap. Morale is in the toilet at my call center and honestly, the job is hard enough without someone telling me that I urinate too frequently. (I don't, I just drink about a gallon of water a day.)

So I decided a doctor's note wasn't my only option. I filed a complaint with OSHA. (For you non-American call center reps, OSHA is a federal agency that deals with workplace safety and health issues.) The guy I spoke to was shocked at the treatment I was receiving and explained to me that this is something OSHA has a very clear policy on. Basically, an employer cannot limit your restroom time. It is expressly stated in their policy that an employer may not restrict your restroom visits to breaks and lunches and that they have to supply restroom facilities as needed. Only in the most extreme cases (if someone abuses personal time and is gone for extended periods) can the employer take action. They took down the direct number for my HR representative and promised to take action immediately. 

I have to say, it was like a big weight was lifted. I always thought this was a shitty company to work for, but I never suspected they would flaunt the rules. I figured they would do everything within the rules that they could to squeeze more production out of us, but I didn't think they'd willfully ignore an established precedent and try to bully someone (me) into only using the bathroom on break times. 

Anyway, apparently after OSHA contacts my employer they will have to report back to them regarding the steps they're taking to be compliant with the rules. The case officer explained to me that I will be kept in the loop. They will give me my employer's official response and I will have a chance to appeal if it is not satisfactory (if my employer tells OSHA they've made a change but I don't see the results.) 

Feels good man. 

-----

Just a PS here... Don't ever waste time contacting HR for an issue or taking advantage of a company's ""open door policy"". Those people are not their to help you or take your side. Their only goal is to bully you into stepping back in line. I called my company's national HR team regarding this issue and they sent a rep down from the head office. This guy parroted the whole stupid ""only breaks and lunches"" mantra and he explained, again, that I could be fired for not complying with this policy. He also implied I was lucky to not have been fired already! 

Don't waste your breath on meeting with anyone affiliated with your employer. If you have a problem with something your employer is doing, take action by calling OSHA, or which ever government labor relations office you have in your country.

I open up the notes and see that she had ""No signal"" on the tv (tv was on the wrong input most likely). However, I also see a note saying ""please bring an extra remote, customer's remote is not responding"". 

I tell her I can cancel the appointment, but ask if she still needs a new remote. ""Yes, the internet is still not working. Can he still come out and check that."" Cue my WUT? face.

""What do you mean the internet isn't working, it says here you just need a new remote""

""Well yes, when I move the remote, nothing happens on the screen. There's a light underneath it, but it's just....stuck.""

""Ma'am, do you mean the remote for your computer?""

""Yes, the one one I use to move the arrow around. It's all just stuck""

""Ok that's called a mouse. You may need a new mouse, but it sounds like your computer is is just frozen. See the buttons on the keyboard that say a-l-t, c-t-r-l, and delete? Press all 3 of those at the same time.""

He tells me that he had a debit card sent via (fast and expensive mail delivery service) and was upset that we would only send it to the address on file, and not a secondary address. He then says he drove by the address and didn't see the package outside, so he wanted to check the delivery status. Red flag at this point, but I continue.

Only other option I have is the amount of a recent check he's written. Fails. I apologize profusely and advise him to go to a branch so they can verify his identification.

This time he went off the deep end. I honestly believe I could hear his veins pumping out of his neck.  This was about a 6 minute rant where I’m sure he made reference to my mother raising a “useless cunt”.

After he stopped yelling -

Me: Ok, I will treat you as a human and with respect if you treat me with respect, otherwise we can sit here in silence.

Him: Your service is shit.

I timed it. After he said this I did not say a word, and nor did he for 16 minutes. 16 damn minutes we sat there in silence. 

Him: So are you going to help me or what? 

Me: Are you going to lose your temper again?

Him: Look, I’m sorry alright. This is just an ongoing issue and I’m 
getting sick of it.

Me: That may be so, and I apologize for that. But you didn’t even give me the chance to look into the issue before you lost it. How would you feel if I called you at your job and called you every name under the sun for something that wasn’t your fault?

Him: Yeah, I see your point. 

After he said sorry, I actually looked into the issue and managed to get a tech out sooner. 

He thanked me and emailed my work complimenting me on my job. 
I got to slack off for 16 minutes… Managed to beat my high score on bubble bobble. Good call.

I've worked for call centers for almost 7 years now (plenty of stories!). This story comes from my first one. I used to work for a Fortune 500 internet company that sold and supported servers, domains and website stuff in general. I was a frontline rep and did basically customer service, sales, and tier 1 tech support. We were all well trained and knew our stuff.

I knew today was going to be my last day. I had missed an important ""mandatory"" meeting the day before and knew I was getting sacked, regardless of how well I did. Needless to say, I didn't care much about any of the phone calls that day. 

Now don't get me wrong, if it was a nice customer, I was more than willing to help. But if any customer was slightly pissed off or smug etc, I was quick to pass them off to someone else via cold transfer (bad karma on me, I know). My company did walk outs at lunch time as to not arouse suspicion (""oh he just didn't come back from lunch"") so I knew my time was running out. I took what I knew was going to be my last call and lucky me, it was king bitch calling to complain about his website being down. 

**Me**: Thank you for calling customer sales and support, my name is SpearDJ, can I start with (verification info) please?

**KB** (not yelling but audibly frustrated): My Website is down and your people can't seem to get a hold on why! I've been passed around and passed around. Now I know you're probably not going to be able to help, but I swear to God if you don't connect me to someone who can help me, I will cancel my account today.


I must have gotten the most shit-eating grin on my face. I'm going to have fun with this guy. I decide to take the call. 


**Me**: I apologize for your website being down and I'd be happy to assist, first I need your (verification info) please?

**KB**: John Smith. Customer number 99999999. Pin is 1234. 

**Me**: Thank you. Now I see you have about 5 websites with us, which one isn't working?

**KB**: God, don't you people read the notes?  It's www.websitehere.com. It's been down for xx hours now.

**Me**: Of course, sir. I just needed to make sure. Now this website is being ran using (our website builder tool) and I am highly trained in it (truth), so let me take a look. 

**KB**: Yeah yeah, do whatever the fuck you want. But like I said, I've spoken with quite a few people now and none of your dumbasses seem to be able to figure it out.

**Me**: Of course, sir. Please hold one moment while I try some things out.

*hold*


So I look at this guy's notes and he's spoken with about 5 different people at this point, but all frontline reps, not once has he gotten to tier 2 tech. I knew I wasn't going to do anything out of my way to help him but I wanted to see what was wrong out of curiosity. Turn out he has put some ""illegal"" code into our website builder and manged to literally break it, requiring a server re-install, so he HAD to be transferred to tier 2 to fix it.


*unhold* 

**Me**: Sir? Thank you for holding. 

**KB**: Goddamn that took FOREVER! What were you doing there? Having coffee?!

**Me**: No sir, I don't even enjoy coffee (trying to get him to laugh, doesn't work). Good news is, I found the issue. Also good news is I know what needs to be done to fix it.

**KB** (cheering up): GREAT!

**Me**: Bad news is I do have to transfer you to a specialist up one level from myself to get it done.

**KB** (sudden bitch mode): OH HELL NO. I'VE SPOKEN WITH 12 PEOPLE NOW (lie) AND I REFUSED TO BE TRANSFERRED. YOU JUST TOLD ME YOU KNOW HOW TO FIX IT, YOU NEED TO FIX IT.

**Me**: No sir, I told you I know what needs to be done to fix it. I know exactly what needs to be done and who you need to talk to get it done. You said yourself I would probably need to get you to someone else, and you are correct.


What can be described next can only be paraphrased into him telling me he knows what he said and why didn't I do that in the first place and why am I wasting his time, etc etc. 


*probably 3 minutes of ranting later*

**Me**: Sir, I know EXACTLY who you need to speak with. Please hold and I will get you transferred. 

**KB**: Fine. Do it, but remember, if I don't get connected to who I need to get to to get this fixed, I am canceling. Do you understand me clearly? 

**Me**: Crystal, sir.

*hold*


I dial the number of who exactly he needs to speak to, and just to be safe, I conferenced them in together so I could hear he got connected properly and I could listen in on mute. 


**PH**: Thank you for calling Pizza Hut, my name is Nathan. Is this for delivery or take out?

**KB**: ...Huh? What?

**PH**: Thank you for calling Pizza Hut, my name is Nathan. Are you calling to place an order? 

**KB**: WHAT THE FUCK. I WAS JUST ON THE LINE WITH (company here) AND NOW I'M TALKING TO PIZZA HUT?! WHAT KIND OF SICK JOKE IS THIS?! WHERE ARE YOU LOCATED?!

**PH** (voice shaking): We are on the corner of (some street) and (some other street). 

**KB**: I know EXACTLY where that is! HOW THE FUCK DID I GET ON THE LINE WITH YOUR DUMB ASS?!

**PH**: I am not sure, but I cannot continue this call due your language. Thank you for calling Pizza hut and have a good day

**KB**: NOW YOU LISTEN HERE.... 

*click*


I also disconnect the call. While he was ranting, I decided to look up a local Pizza Hut that was near him. I figured he hasn't eaten for a while and that's why he was so grumpy. 

Right after the call, my supervisor motioned me over, he was almost in tears from laughing so hard. After he calmed down he told me that he'll always remember this and he won't tell a soul and hopes it wasn't QA'd. He then told me to meet him in the conference room where I found my HR manager and security. I left that job with the biggest smile on my face ever. I cashed in my 401k (stupid I know) and lived off that for 4 months before going back and landing another job at another call center.

I was roped into doing a bit of overtime for Christmas day last year, which was insanely quiet (like 2 calls over 2 hours mostly for setting up their kids presents on their broadband) as I was about to leave at 4pm  I get a call from a charming woman who choses not to greet me but instead yell down the phone at me - the conversation went a little something like this:

Customer:  I DEMAND YOU FIX MY WASHING MACHINE OR I'LL CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION WITH YOU IMEDIATELY!!
Me: Thanks for calling &lt;company&gt; my name is hacey, before we can discuss anything i'll need to first of all take your name.

C: I'm not giving you my name, you don't need it you just need to fix my washing machine, it's not working.

M: I'm sorry you're having troubles with your washing machine but i'm afraid there's nothing we can do to help you with this as we only supply TV broadband and phone services, as such you'll need to phone your manufacturer for assistance, who more than likely won't be open on Christmas day.

C: I know that, I already tried phoning them - they're shut, but I want you to fix this, I pay YOU a subscription and YOU will fix it.

At this point the call descends into a back and forth for ten mins of me telling her I can fix her tv but not her washing machine.
The customer still refusing to accept this demands a manager, I tell her that won't be a problem and put her on hold.

I find the nearest manager explain the problem and he comes over and without allowing the woman to speak tells her that it's christmas day, and we won't be fixing her washing machine, she'll need to call her manufacturer he then hangs up on her.

In my entire time there, that's the only badass thing a manager has done for anyone on the phones, 30mins after my shift and I manage to escape and get me some Christmas ham :)

That's bait and switch!""",87,16,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/1jbe3f/site_error_or_you_cant_do_that_thats_bait_and/,"So I've created a throwaway account to regale you with a tale of horror from the past month, and also because I don't want to be fired due to some small print in my employment contract. 

I work for a company that sells out its customer service services to large companies. I landed myself in chat support for a big electronics retail chain, I will not confirm which one. We're supposed to say we work for the chain, but really nothing could be further from the truth. They hardly give us any abilities or solid information and we're largely there to provide information regarding policies and products customer can look up on the site. Need something done? Contact the phone line, it's where we'll send you.

In any case within the past month or so we had a big fuck up. Someone misplaced a decimal or a line of code and one of the items on our site was temporarily listed as on sale for $0.01. People from all over swarmed to get this ""deal"" and by the time the big company found out about it, a good number  of people had netted themselves a free piece of software. Of course as soon as it was caught, the company began auto-cancelling orders immediately and the grief began.

We started getting chats immediately about this, very few from people who knew it was an issue and had already scored their copy and wanted to make sure we knew, a few self-titled ""journalists"" looking for coverage for their blog, and a lot of pissed-off customers.

""Hey, I just wanted to touch bases with you. Yeah, my order was canceled. WHY?""

""Oh, you're here about that! Sorry, it was a site error. The item was supposed to be bundled with another item for free, so we're canceling the orders.""

""YOU CAN'T DO THAT, THAT'S ILLEGAL!""

No, it's not.

or

""THAT'S BAIT AND SWITCH!""

Yeah, because we totally sold you one item and gave you another. No, wait, we didn't. (this one was sadly the most common argument)

or

""BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY GOT THEIR COPY.""

They got it outside the terms of use because of a site error and it was a digital download. Had it been a physical item, nobody would have gotten it.

But in this case the item in question had a listing in its description saying it was only purchasable and free with a specific item in question. The fact that they could add it to the cart at all without that item was a site error. Our conditions of use pretty clearly had a section on us being allowed to cancel orders as part of a site error.

All of this we had to piece together on our own the first day. We were broad-sided by this issue, and the big company wasn't issuing a statement for even us. We really had no power to give the item to them in the first place, so we had to invent our own reasons it was being canceled. The big company issued a statement to us the next day, but it was pretty much exactly what we pieced together. 

The hilarious thing was about 80% of the customers were demanding they get their product because they PAID GOOD MONEY for it and THEY DESERVE IT. The company probably ended up refunding thousands of pennies worth of orders over this mistake.

I find it amazing how justified people can make themselves feel over having paid a penny for a site error. My favorite quote:

""BUT I NEED THAT MONEY FOR GAS TO GET TO WORK. YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME HOMELESS""

Yeah, that entire one cent would have probably gotten your car started, maybe. And if you needed it for gas so much, why did you spend it in the first place?

There were seven call centers throughout the nation filled with debt collectors like me working for $15 dollars per hour and motivated by getting hired and seeing our names at the top of the spreadsheet the next day.

Well, I had been a temp for a year, working in ""mid collections"" (30-59 days past due). Everyone else in mid collections was a permanent employee getting paid a shit ton more, with benefits, even though I was always number one or two in terms of accounts being resolved. After about 6 months of this, I did what anyone would do and started taking 1.5 hour lunch breaks, looking at fashion blogs, etc. I was soon demoted to ""The Dialer.""

The Dialer is an automatic calling system that identifies people who are less than 30 days past due, and harasses the shit out of them (know your rights, people! but also, make your payments). The poor, poor individuals on the dialer have to try to collect a payment in 3 minutes, type their notes in less than 15 seconds, and then as soon as they hit ""submit"" the fucking thing beeps and you have another call. It doesnt even ring, this thing just calls and calls and hopes a collector becomes available every time someone picks up. So we're pissed, they're pissed, but I'm extra pissed because they've figured out just the system to make us just dependent on them enough to not leave, but also to squeeze as much lif---er, efficiency out of us as possible. 

So enter Jimmy (I don't remember his real name). I imagine that this guy was just driving along in his vehicle, saw the dreaded number, and picked up (because if you don't the thing calls and calls). ""Yep, I'll pay when I always do- on the last day of the month.""

Oh hell no. This guy clearly has no fear of me. Plus, then I get a 'no promise to pay"", and they somehow had conditioned me to still fear these things, despite not giving a shit.

Me [passive aggressively]: ""Oh sure, you can do that but then, sir, you'll have a large payment at the end of all of the additional interest that has not been factored into your payment at the end of your loan, and you won't get your title without it.""

We argue for a bit, but then he realizes I'm right and this pisses him off.

Him: ""Why can't you just call and note your account, then hang up like everyone else?"" 

Me: ""Sir, I just thought I'd let you know.""

Him [whining]: ""You don't know what it's like to have to pay back student loans and a car payment.""

I glance at his information, bored with the excuses. OK, he's 29. He has a cosigner- his mom. That's fine, whatever. Some people haven't established credit... OK.

Me: ""Oh sir, I actually DO know what it is like to pay back student loans, and that's why I'm not financing a vehicle I can't pay for according to the terms that I legally agreed upon.""

Him: ""Oh, so you went to college? I find that really hard to believe because you sound like JUST ANOTHER STUPID BITCH TO ME.""

Me: ""Oh, haha, that's funny sir, because I was just thinking how sad you must be that you're 29 and still need your mother to cosign loans for you.""

Him: ""FUCK YOU!""

I believe what I did next was close my eyes, lightly chuckle, and moved my head and shoulders from side to side. 

I opened my eyes and my supervisor was standing right there, completely mortified. She didn't say a word to me, just went into her cubicle, put on her headphones that she uses to review recordings, then made a phone call.

I can't be exactly sure what that was all about, but I do know that I received a call from my temp agent that night and never stepped foot in the building again.

And that's fine by me, because I hardly recognize that angry, sadistic person any more. I collected unemployment and watched madmen all summer. And it was great.

Background: I'm a customer service rep for a telecommunications company in Canada. An awesome one, btw, they're all about the customer, and they actually mean it. We do phone, internet, and TV, and this guy had phone and internet.

This guy, let's call him Friendly Joe, hadn't called us in so long, I didn't see a single note in the history. He starts off by saying that normally, his business handles his standard paperwork and bills for him, and his new secretary had mentioned that his phone bill seemed kinda high.

He looked at it, and low and behold... it did seem kind of high. So, he called us up, got me, and asked me if the pricing seemed off at all. He was nice and friendly, just seemed a little concerned.

I pulled up the bill and struggled to not gasp out loud. Holy hell, he'd paid $150 in long distance charges... for less than 150 minutes...

So, then I look at the previous month's bill. And the one before that.

The guy's been paying over $100 a month, every month, for as far back as I cared to look (and in my morbid curiousity, I checked it as far back as 2007). For long distance. His bill was typically about $200 a month...

So I said, ""Ok, well, basically what happened here is... you're on a god awful, ancient plan, which I'm going to change. We can discuss what plan you want to get on, but this... this is going to change. That's what's happening now.""

Joe: ""Oh, that's what's wrong? (To wife: She says we're on an old plan, that's why the bill is high.) Ok. I'm curious, how old is this plan? How long have we been paying these higher rates?""

Me: ""...are you sure you want to know? I'd have to look it up - it's so old, I hadn't even heard of it.""

Joe: *laughs in a friendly way* ""Yeah, I'm curious.""

Me: *Looks it up* ""Let's see... your internet plan was grandfathered about a year ago, your phone package was grandfathered in 2009, and that long distance plan was grandfathered... in 2002.""

Joe: ""We've been paying bad rates for that long?""

Me: ""Erm, well, that's when the plan was grandfathered. I don't even know when you got on it - we don't have great records from that long ago. I'm sure it was a great plan back in the day, when long distance was kind of hard, but technology has come a long way since then. Modern plans are massively better.""

Joe: ""Couldn't your company have changed it for us?""

Me: ""Well, we're not supposed to change plans without talking to you about it first.""

Joe: ""Did you ever try to contact us?""

Me: ""Yep. Blah blah blah (you're on the list for e-mail, mail, and telemarketing calls, which are both sales and to get you on modern plans, but you probably ignored it because people tend to think it's bothersome spam. Really, you should check with us occasionally to make sure your plans keep up with the times) Blah.""

Talking bits happen where he says ""Oh, ok,"" and we discuss what long distance plan and calling feature package he wants. And he's friendly as can be throughout the whole thing, and I'm just feeling awful about the bills he's been paying - never missed a single payment, either. Never a complaint.

Joe: ""So, you'll be changing it from today on forward?""

Me: ""Not only am I doing that, here's what else I'm going to do. Normally, I should only offer to rerate the last month, maybe three months, but I'm going to go back six months, and rerate your long distance plans as if you were on this new plan. So, it's $6/month, that'll be $36 staying on your account, but I'm going to wipe the rest. I don't even know how much it'll be, because it'll take me a while. How about I call you when I'm done?""

Joe: ""Wow, that's great of you! I really appreciate it! Sure, gimme a call at XXX-XXXX.""

30 minutes later...

Me: ""Hi, Joe! I've got some great news. I credited you back $950 (ish?), so your present balance is a credit of $800-something ($890?). And now that your bill will be ($70? I think?) per month, you'll have like 6 months of free service, basically.""

Joe: ""Wow. You are amazing. Where do I send the bouquet of roses?""

He sounded possibly serious...

Me: ""Ahh..."" *actually blushes* ""I really appreciate the thought...""

Joe, still serious sounding: ""You are a fantastic and sweet girl, and I just want you to know how much my wife and I appreciate what you've done for us today. Thank you.""

Me: *blushes some more* ""Glad I could help!""

Here he was, getting word that he was overpaying massive amounts. And he was kind, respectful, intelligent, and understanding. They say the squeaky wheel gets the oil, but not from me. Bastards get nadda from me, I'll balk at every turn, but I just basically gave this guy almost $1,000 in credits that I didn't have to, because he treated me like a human being.

1361733262.0,65,self.talesfromcallcenters,1957hz,Your delinquency is not our emergency,81,16,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/1957hz/your_delinquency_is_not_our_emergency/,"So I work for a rather large credit union in the States. I hear some pretty stupid things from our members every day and on weekends most of the facepalm moments come from members who don't understand how financial institutions work.

Some background information:

1. Banks do not process on the weekends or holidays because all information has to be processed through the Federal Reserve, which is closed on weekends and holidays.

2. In our terms and conditions for loans and credit cards, there is a clause saying that if your account becomes delinquent we will place restrictions on your debit cards, credit cards, and online banking (including our mobile app) until a payment is made and processes through. 

3. Those same terms and conditions say that after so many days of delinquency we will take the payment from any account that you have legal title to (including joint accounts). This automatic system runs at processing between midnight and 6am and we lovingly refer to it as ""nightstalker"".

So, here's where the story starts getting interesting. Believe it or not, some of our members will allow their account to go delinquent so that nightstalker will take the payment and they don't have to worry about taking the 30 seconds to make the payment themselves. Of course, by the time the nightstalker system is activated, the account has been fully restricted (i.e. debit cards/online banking not working).

Towards the end of my shift yesterday, one of this brilliant people calls in. Remember, it's Saturday, no processing until MONDAY night.

After verifying the member, the conversation goes something like this:

Member: How much I got in my checkin's account?

Me: You have $3500 and 57 cents.

Mbr: THEN WHY AIN'T MY DEBIT CARD WORKIN?!

Me: Well ma'am, your loan is delinquent. It was due on the 12th.

Mbr: THIS HAPPENED LAST MONTH TOO! I'M 'BOUT TO PULL ALL MY MONEY FROM YOUR BANK BECAUSE YOU KEEP RESTRICTING MY ACCOUNT. I GOTS THE MONEY; WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE IT? THAT'S WHAT THEY DID LAST MONTH? WHY AIN'T YOU DID IT THIS MONTH?

Me: I'm sorry this is inconveniencing you ma'am, but the reason your account keeps getting restricted is because you are waiting for our collections system to pull the payment, which doesn't happen until you are delinquent and at that point the restrictions are in place. If you'd like I can set up an automatic payment to come out every month so you don't have to call in and don't have to rely on the collections system.

Mbr: SO WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS YOU WANT ME TO MOVE MY MONEY ELSEWHERE. THAT'S FINE. USAA DON'T DO THIS. I'LL JUST MOVE MY MONEY TO THEM.

Me: Ma'am, you do have the option to set up automatic payments so your account is always paid on time. Or you can go online before the payment is overdue and transfer the money yourself if you prefer. The restrictions are something you agreed to when you applied for the loan.

Mbr: I DON'T WANT TO SET UP AUTOMATIC PAYMENTS. YOU SHOULD JUST TAKE THE MONEY WHEN IT'S DUE. I HAVE IT IN MY ACCOUNT, SO JUST TAKE IT.

Me: I'd be more than happy to take the payment today, but if I remove the restriction it will get placed back on the account until the payment is processed through on Monday night.

Mbr: WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS SO HARD? JUST TAKE THE PAYMENT AND REACTIVATE MY CARD. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU KEEP RESTRICTING MY ACCOUNT. I'M TAKING MY MONEY ELSEWHERE. I NEED TO SPEAK TO A SUPERVISOR. I SEE WE ARE JUST GOING TO KEEP GOING AROUND IN CIRCLES.

Me: Well certainly ma'am. I can have a supervisor speak with you. Do you mind if I just place you on a brief hold?

Mbr: Yeah, I guess I can wait.

HOLD

Supervisor: What can I help you with today?

Me: This member is relying on nightstalker to make her loan payments...

Supervisor:...Oh lord -heavy sigh- Put her through, I'll see if I can get through to her.

This lady called in on one of the property accounts we answer for.  You know, normal call.  She's locked herself out of her apartment.  I take her information down and hang up the phone.  It went normally, minus being 4:00 AM.

I called the technician two minutes later, waking the poor shmoe up out of a dead sleep to get him over there to unlock this woman's house.  Two minutes later, I get a call and it goes like this:

Me:Hello, such and such property management.  How can I help you?

Her:Hey, I'm locked out of my apartment.

Me:May I ask who is calling?  (I didn't recognize her voice right off.  Busy night.)

Her:It's Stupid Twat again.  Where's the technician?  You, like, said you'd call him.

Me:I did call him.  He should get back to you soon.

Her:Why isn't he down here, like, right *now*?  I'm locked out of my apartment!

Me:He'll be calling you any minute now.

Her:Well, I feel, like, this should be faster.  I've been, like, sitting outside my apartment and it's four AM.

Me:Yes, it's four AM.  (I'm starting to get a little incredulous with this bitch.) I had to wake him up.

Her:Well, could you like, call him back and like, get his ass down here?  I want to, like, get into my place!

Me:He might be calling you, like, right now.  (This subtle jab flies RIGHT passed her head.) 

Her:Jeez, I swear, I pay, like, rent every month and my lease says somebody is here to, like, take care of maintenance issues.

(It's now been precisely seven minutes since her first call.)

Me:I'm sure he'll call you *right* away. 

Her:Whatever, stupid shit.

We were also fully trained to deal with emergencies of various types.

One afternoon I got a call from a gentleman who my system told me was of middle age.  I went through security with him and asked him how I could help.

His problem was that there were exposed wires in his house.  So I asked if they were sparking, or if there was any water nearby or dripping through, or if the wires were within reach of children or near head hight, if the electricity supply was on. 

I was expecting to provide him with safety advice, and checked if he had any sort of repair cover on his contract.  He didn't, so I gave him some advice for his immediate safety and suggested he might wish to be put through to our emergency call out team. 

I informed the gentleman of the costs involved in getting such cover, but being the honest and helpful person I am, thought it better that he might want to call an electrician to look over his whole house (an old house he had just moved to).

This did not satisfy the customer.  He was upset, I was obviously no good at my job.

He wanted to know why we did not fix that sort of thing for him, after all, it was our electrical equipment.

I've been doing it for about 7 years.  Most of our clients are Doctor's Offices.  I work the overnight shift, so it's predominately hospitals trying to reach doctors.  

Most of the time, hospital callers are rushed, and understandably so, particularly if it's the emergency room.  The don't have much patience to go over the details, and sometimes, they are just downright nasty.  A lot of times, they don't have complete information, which can suck for the answering service, because then we have to call a doctor out of bed at some god awful hour and say we don't know why we're calling them.  Let me tell you how much fun those conversations are:  None.  None at all.

Many of our clients cover for one another, but don't bother telling us when, or whom is covering for whom.  Usually, I can figure it out if I know which hospital they are calling from, though.
Our story begins on a typical Wednesday evening.  In addition to simply relaying the message, as the night shift operator, I'm tasked with cleaning the office, running reports and compiling the days stats.  It's not hard, but I'm often away from my desk.  It can take me a while to get to the phone sometimes, but normally not more than a few seconds.  I was in the reception office when i heard the phone, so I ran back to my desk.

Me: Thank you for calling [Doctor]'s office, which Doctor may I contact for you?

Bitchy Caller: Finally!

Me: ...I'm sorry, how can I help you?

BC: I need which ever doctor is covering for (name I've never heard before). Now.

Me:  I'm not familar with that Doctor.  Are you trying to reach ABC practice?

BC:  Yes! Get me the doctor!

Me: Which hospital are you calling from?

BC: (sigh) [Name of hospital]

Me: That would be either Dr. A or Dr. B.  Do you have a preference as to which one I call?

BC: This is ridiculous.  Are you an idiot? Don't you know who is covering for your own doctors?  I've been trying to get a live person since FIVE O'clock (note: it's now after midnight) and all of these recordings keep hanging up on me and I just need who ever is covering for [Doctor I've never heard of].  I need them NOW! You get in touch with them NOW! Page them both!

Me: Certainly, ma'ma, I'll page a doctor for you.  (pages both doctors).


Now, I understand her frustration if she genuinely had been trying to reach someone since 5 pm, but looking at our call history, this was the first call to this particular office all day, so she hadn't been speaking with us, if she had been calling all afternoon.  I was resigned to just let it go as her taking her frustration out on me, but about 15 minutes later, Dr. A  calls in and asks why we paged him with this call.  I tell him the story, and he says his practice doesn't cover for that doctor, but since the patient is in the ER at a hospital they  do cover,  they will return the call.  Dr B calls in a few minutes later, and apologetically, I relay the events to him as well.  He is not happy, but says he understands the situation, and asks that I not page any more calls from this caller.

An hour later, BC calls back, ranting that the doctor was rude to her, how I'm an idiot, and the doctor is an idiot.  Trying to keep my cool, I ask her if she knows the name of the practice the doctor she was intially trying to reach is with, becuase this is ABC practice.   She does, and she tells me, its DEF practice.  I say again that she's reached ABC, and ask her if she tried calling DEF practice.  She gets really quiet, and mutters ""Shit."" and then hangs up.

I let about 30 mins go by and call the repair shop

The reason he's upset? He wanted to complain about a retail store calling the cops on him, for ""no reason"". He did admit he was yelling and cussing, but didn't feel that was a reason to call the cops to escort him out.

I finally get the account up. Alert saying he is now banned from that store comes up with his account.

Store notes say the customer snapped his phone in half, stomped on it, screamed obscenities and then attempted to attack another (female) customer when they stepped in asked him to calm down.

He couldn't even make out words he was so pissed...and immediately hung up.  
Always....always....kill them with kindness, it breaks their soul xD  
I was doing my job just fine, he had to be ""ONE"" of those asshole men/husbands we always get who think they have priority over their wife's account.  
Sadly...I will not get the joy of seeing how flustered he gets when he talks to Bank of the Best to find out how wrong he is...and that he was a total Idiot :)  
  
Also after 1st call, I kept the card number on my notepad as a ""just-in-case callback""  
And after that stupid second call I immediately called the Lead Desk and informed them what was going on, that the guy literally just called back to try and harass me about his idiocity.  
My friend Kitty was on Lead Desk today, gave her the card number and she facepalmed at the whole story...she said that if he called back to just send him up to her since, so a supervisor would say the same thing and can chew him out since he is going on his tirade, and that we can report him if continues to do if he reaches any other agents on the floor since we have the account information :)

I work in a call centre in the UK that represents many clients.  We are referred to as outsourced.  The unit that I am on is for a client that sells broadband, landline, mobiles and dongles and is represented by two letters.  All the departments on my unit are exclusively for almost everything to do with the broadband and landline.

Right, that should be enough, on with the story.

I received a call today from a gentleman who had read online about [the Prime Minister proposing the block adult websites.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23401076)  It seems that he thinks that this is a very good idea.

**Gentleman:**  I would like you to block pornographic websites for me

**Me:**  Unfortunately we're unable to do this for you.

**Gentleman:** But I've read on the news that you have to do this now.

**Me:** No, what you have read is something that is being proposed but hasn't been put into effect.

**Gentleman:** Well I still want these websites blocking.  I need to protect my family from these sites.

**Me:**  Well we can't block any website unless ordered to do so by the high court.  You can filter certain websites through the settings in your router, but we don't offer support for this.

**Gentleman:** Well how am I supposed to protect my family if you can't help?

**Me:** You are able to go online and research how to do this.  It is something that can be done, but our technical guys can't help you to do this.

**Gentleman:** No, I know you can help me.  You can block certain numbers when I ask you to do I know you can block certain websites.  They do this in France.

**Me:** Yes, we can block certain numbers but that's completely different to blocking websites and the systems used in France are different to the ones used here.  Ours don't have the capability.

**Gentleman:** Yes you can.  I know you can.  You're all under the same company so I know you can

*I had gotten really fed up at this point and just switched off.*

**Me:** I'm afraid we can't do this.

**Gentleman:** I know you can.  You just don't want to help.

**Me:** I do want to help, but our systems cannot do what you're asking

**Gentleman:** I know that they can, they're all the same systems.  I know this so please block these websites.

**Me:** No, they can't.

**Gentleman:** I need to protect my family, you can block these websites.  I don't know why you can block certain phone numbers but not websites.  You just don't want to help me

**Me:** (automated responses at this point) we can't.

**Gentleman:** I want to speak to your manager.

**Me:** No problem at all.  Just know that my manager, her manager nor anyone working for the UK variant of this company can block these websites whatsoever.

**Gentleman:** I still want to speak to her.

**Me:** No problem, she'll call you in 2 days.

2. Sorry for the delay! When I hear someone say ""retailmenot"", I go into a fugue state and start stabbing people.

3. The reason you don't see that product on our website is because we don't carry it. The reason that item doesn't look like it's on sale is because it's not. It is not Opposite Day.

4. Do not say ""never mind - I'll just call instead"" if you don't like my answer. You are literally calling someone no more than 30 feet from me. It'll take longer, then, because you'll have to explain yourself all over again, and then the person you called will have to get up and go ask the same manager the same question. Sometimes they just ask me what I was going to tell you, and then they tell you that.

5. You know those surveys you fill out at the end of a chat? Yeah, I can see those.

6. I'm sorry that you're bored and just want to chat with me for fun. I would love to do that, but I'm getting paid to humor you, so it makes me feel like a phone sex worker. Try Omegle. 

7. That dresser costs more than the one that Walmart sells because it's solid poplar, has dovetail joinery, the manufacturer pays their employees a living wage, and it comes fully assembl... aaaand you just closed the chat. Enjoy your ""savings"".

8. Yes, this is taking a long time. That's either because a) I'm required to chat with 2 people at once, b) you're on facebook and it's taking you 3 minutes to respond to my questions, c) I am using the most idiotic, user-unfriendly software you can possibly imagine, or d) because I'm not chit-chatting with you as much as I would on the phone while I look up information, the pauses feel much longer. I also have to type everything and then you have to read it, so it's just naturally going to take longer than a phone call.

9. When googling our competitor's name, you should probably try the search bar rather than my chat window.

And finally....

10 . Yes, shipping does cost a lot! Fuel is expensive, as is the labor for the many hands that your package passes through and the technology used to get it to your front door. We are not Amazon. Since all you do is complain about how much shipping is, though, we're in the process of jacking up our prices so we can afford to offer flat-rate shipping on some of our products.

Needless to say we told her it wasn't going to happen and it was her responsibility to update her details.

Not because they are know it alls, oh no, but because they are usually the ones who know the least on how whatever product your supporting usually works. 

So queue me coming in today to make up some hours and I have someone call in demanding to know why they're in collections and how they *own* a collections agentcy so this could never possibly happen to them because they know how this works. Great, one of these calls, pull a email up to be ready to send to a supervisor, because this is bound to be fun. I explain that yes, you may have requested to cancel your auto-billed monthly package at the end of the plan year, but you know what? You spoke to the wrong people (no one makes it easy to cancel, it ain't fair but thats how business works), then you *used the package*. If you hadn't used it and stopped paying, no harm, no foul, no collections, but by using it you consented to the cost. 

This of course starts a bit of back and forth because she doesn't remember using the package, until I'm able to pull up her bill and show her where it's used, and thats where I get shocked. ""Well, why didn't you guys call me and tell me I was going past due?"" ""Well Ms. Client, we called your number ending 1234 on a weekly basis for 4 months"", ""and did you send letters?"", ""yep, 4.""

A moment of silence, which I spend prepping for the inevidible blast of arguments and denials, start prepping the email for a supervisor callback. ""Oh! Well that makes total sense, I guess my son used the service and didn't tell me. Anyway you can pull a few strings and help us out?"" My brain goes blank for a moment, she just agreed with me? Wow, this never happens, she's gone from nightmare client to dream client. ""You know what, give me a sec and I'll see what I can do, how about this, you used about half of the package, why don't I cut the debt in half and we'll call it even?"" (I could have settled for maybe 1/4 of the debt and my supervisor wouldn't have batted an eye). ""That sounds perfect! Let me go yell at my son a bit and make him pay for it, will this offer still be available when he or I call back?"" I'm doing backflips, a client who claims to know the business, asks intelligent questions and then ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS THE BUSINESS? Have I entered some bizzaro world? ""Sure! Just give us a call back, no need to ask for me directly, anyone in my team can honor my offer."" Ms. Client was head over heels thankful to me for explaining and for my offer, I'm head over heels because I don't have to escalate the call and even if I'm not getting a $180.00 payment, someone in my team will soon. Just goes to show, doesn't matter how long you're in the business, you're always going to have someone surprise you, and not always in a bad way.

At least I hope. Now I hear and see some pretty astonishing things, especially since this is REAL money I deal with every day. Things ranging from people spending money and not realizing it or remembering where they spent it, not keeping statements, leaving their debit/credit cards lying around, etc. The most astonishing thing though, and this is a weekly occurance, is that people don't understand how credits and debits work. It feels like I end one shift a week explaining that if someone takes money from you and then gives that exact amount back on the same day, then nothing about the account was really changed.

When we do processing at night, we process all deposits and credits first, and then process the debits. This apparently confuses the fuck out of our members.

Me: Thank you for calling most amazing credit union ever. May I have your first and last name please?

Member: Kan't DoMath

Me: Thank you, Ms. DoMath. How can I help you today?

Mbr: I see a purchase on my account for $199.95. I don't remember making a purchase that large.

Me: Well, ma'am, it looks like that was a debit WE took from you. Bear with me a moment while I look over your account and see why we took this from you. (Moments later). It looks like we gave you a provisional credit for a dispute and then you received a credit from that merchant so we took back what they credited to you.

Mbr: I don't remember them ever crediting back what I disputed.

Me: Do you keep your statements ma'am?

Mbr: No, I usually just check my account online. I throw my statements away.

Me: -facepalming, hard- Okay ma'am let get a supervisor on the line to see if they can dig a little deeper as to when this was credited.

(Hold. Instrumental of ""I Believe I Can Fly)

Supervisor: What are we looking at today.

Me: We took a debit from her account, but I can't see where the merchant ever credited her back.

SV: Okay, let's look at her statements. (silence). This happened back in December. Looks like the merchant sent the credit on the same night as the debit and then we gave her a provisional credit the next day when the paperwork went through. Seems as though we got confirmation from the merchant recently that they already fixed the problem, so we took our credit back.

Me: Awesome, thanks. (Back to member). Okay ma'am, what it looks like happened is we took the extra credit we gave you back in December because the merchant credited your account as well.

Mbr: I don't remember that happening. Are you sure? 

Me: Yes ma'am. Because the amount taken and the amount credited back are within just a few cents of each other, you most likely wouldn't have noticed if you are just checking your balance and not the transactions. I'm looking at the statement this happened on.

Mbr: Well, I don't remember.

Me: Do you have access to your online information. You can bring up the statement and I'll show you exactly what I'm looking at.

Mbr: Yeah, but it might take a minute.

Me: That's fine, I can wait. Just let me know when you have your account access pulled up.

(15 minutes later)

Mbr: Okay, I have the statement pulled up.

Me: Right. So, if you look about halfway down the page, you'll see where the merchant gave you $199.95. Then you'll see where you were charged an international fee of $2.00. Next there should be an amount of $200 deducted. Correct?

Mbr: Yeah.

Me: Then, on the next day you'll see where we credited the original disputed amount of $200. Basically, we received your paperwork the day after the dispute was taken care of by the merchant themselves and we gave you an unnecessary credit. After receiving confirmation from the merchant that they had taken care of it, we went back into your account to investigate, and then took what was owed back to us.

Mbr:...I don't understand. You charged me twice.

Me: No, we actually GAVE you an extra $200, then took back the $199.95 amount to make up for the extra credit the merchant gave you.

Cue 20 minute circular conversation on how negative numbers, debits, and credits work.

Mbr: That still doesn't seem right.

Me: Let's use different numbers then. Let's say you have a friend borrow $5 from you. So you go to another friend and ask to borrow $5 until person A returns what you owe them. Then, a few hours later, person A gives you the $5 back that he borrowed. You now have an extra $5.

Mbr: Okay. I get that.

Me: Now, you go and spend that extra $5. Person B goes to Person A and says ""You still owe -member's name- $5."" Person A says ""No, I paid her."" So Person B, comes back and asks for the $5 you borrowed from them. You are now even with where you started, but negative because you spent the extra $5 you borrowed.

Mbr: Yeah, I understand that. But this is different.

Me: No, it's the exact same thing, with bigger numbers. The only recommendation I can make is to start keeping your statements and to start paying attention to what is going into and out of your account. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Mbr: No, I think you explained it all, but I still don't get it.

Mbr: Thank you for calling. Have a nice weekend.

This is why America is in a recession. Too many people don't understand negative numbers.

GET ME A SUPERVISOR!""",69,10,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/188oib/i_cant_hear_you_get_me_a_supervisor/,"I take tech support calls (among others) for an ISP, and normally our customers are pretty friendly - we get some angry ones, but I generally read much worse stuff here on /r/talesfromcallcenters. However, I've been having a pretty shit weekend in terms of customers, including this lovely woman.

Customer calls, I give opening spiel, take her details, get into the account, no worries. I realise I've spoken to this woman before and while she was a little unpleasant to listen to (sounds *super drunk*, is generally loud and kind of abrasive all the time), I didn't recall her being impolite or anything. I'd only dealt with her previous for a billing enquiry, not tech support. 

So she tells me her Internet isn't working, and it's not showing as online on my end, so I get her to check the signal values and they're way out of range. I tell her this, and ask her to try moving around a bit to see if we can strengthen the signal at all (she's got one of those wireless dongles). I also try to ask if she's been able to successfully connect at her location before, but around this time she starts yelling that she can't hear me.

The woman continues to yell down the phone ""I CAN'T HEAR YOU"", ""SPEAK UP"", etc. I've turned my microphone volume all the way up, and I start speaking louder (coworkers start to look over to find out why I'm practically yelling at this woman), and let her know that I've done all I can for the volume. At this point she asks to be transferred to another agent who she can hear (hello, we're a fucking call centre, did you ever consider maybe it's *your* phone?) - I check with a supervisor if he's okay with this and he tells me nope, no one's available, she'll have to call back if that's what she wants. Relay this to the customer, she's cranky, but at this point I don't care, just put on my general polite voice and try to resume troubleshooting.

So again, try asking the beast if she'll move around a bit to see if we can strengthen that signal for her. She tells me ""I *never* have to do this!"" and tells me just to ""fix it"". Grit my teeth and tell her this is our standard troubleshooting procedure (which I'm sure she'd know, considering she has a fucking screen full of notes from previous calls) and we do have to proceed this way. 

At this point this woman starts yelling to transfer her to someone who 'knows what they're talking about'. I, again, advise her that there are currently no other agents available, and that this is the standard troubleshooting procedure. Then she starts to demand a supervisor. I tell her a supervisor will tell her the same thing, but check with the same one as before to see if he wants to talk to her, who tells me he's just clocked out, and our other supervisor is on break. Take the she-beast off hold and tell her there aren't any supervisors available right now, would she be okay if one calls her back when they're available?

I pull her package, and explain that we've contacted the MD's office three times now, and have received no response from them.  That set her off.

I spent 3 years in the department handling tech support calls with internet and cable issues. I was pretty good at my job when I wanted to be, averaging 5 mins a call at times.

Fast forward a few years and I am now at the end of my employment with this company. My then fiance was moving for work and I was following her so I was quitting. On my last day I brought in donuts for my team, I wore a suit, (we were normally business casual) and did my best spending as little time as possible between calls and being generally as helpful as possible. Contrary to a few posts I've seen in here and /r/talesfromtechsupport my last day was actually shaping up to be a pretty good one. Then he called.

It started out like any other call, gave him my opening line asked how I could help. Apparently his cable wasn't working and he needed it for his kids. No problem. I bring up his account, confirm details and right away I noticed his account was well over due, to the tune of around $400-500. So I explained to him that due to his bill being so far behind we had turned off his services to prompt a call so we could make payment arrangements.

At this point he flipped his shit, calling me every name in the book, going on and on about how we were bullies, ripping him off, ass-raping him over his bill being a little behind all the usual stuff. I guess at this point 3 years of bullshit from tech support boiled up and came out when he threatened to leave and go to one of the competitors. At which point I said, ""Well sir, that is your choice and you are free to make it, but I will tell you now that no matter who you choose for service they are all going to expect you to pay your bill on time. Thank you for calling, have a nice day."" And I hung up on him.

Was it the nice thing to do? Not really. Was it the mature route to finishing my last day with class? Definitely not, but dammit it felt good and I really didn't care it was my last day. In the end I think one of my supervisors overheard my call because about an hour later they came over and shook my hand, allowed me to bid my farewells to my teammates and escorted me from the building about halfway through my shift.

Silence.

I finally ask her if there's a friend or family member I can speak with that might be able to help her and show her what to do. She replys ""Well honey, you've been fine and very nice, but is there maybe a man I can talk to? They're just more competent at this stuff then we are""

1364238622.0,60,self.talesfromcallcenters,1aznja,...and you came BACK?!

It's about 8:00 at night and I am counting down the minutes until the call center closes, which is 9:00pm, dreaming about how I'm going to re-invest my hard earned cash right back into the on hill bar with my friends later. It's pretty slow and I'm there only one there, so when the phone finally rings I race back in from the child care center next door where I was watching TV and pick up:

**Me**: Thank you for calling (resort) you're speaking with ThatCanuck, how may I help you?

**Betty**: *(little old lady voice)* Hello? Can you hear me? 

**Me**: Yes, how can I help you this evening?

**Betty**: I just wanted to let you know that I've had a very bad experience at your resort tonight. 

**Me**: Oh, I see. I am sorry to hear that. How can I help?

**Betty**: Well, I fell into a mineshaft. 


*This is a destination ski resort with on mountain lodging. While we are located in the mountains, I can assure you there are no open mine shafts in our surrounding area, let alone close enough for a guest to fall into on an evening walk.*


**Me**: Are you sure it was a mineshaft? What did it look like?


Betty begins to explain, all the while becoming more and more agitated, that she left her hotel room to meet up with some friends at a nearby restaurant, also located on hill. Judging by the location of her room and the restaurant she mentions, she should have only had to walk about 5-6 minutes down the well-lit and well travelled road from her front door before she found the place. If that wasn't enough, it was a beautiful calm night and the restaurant had large signage out front. 


**Betty**: Where ever I was, it was very dark and I was in a tunnel. I didn't have my phone on me and I am diabetic, so I very well could have had a seizure!

**Me**: Oh my. Are you ok now? Did you manage to find your way back?


Now Betty is starting to get a little angry. She keeps insisting that we have a very dangerous, open mineshaft on the hill and that she was very close to suffering a diabetic seizure in the middle of no where without anyone knowing where she was.  


I ask Betty for more information but before I can get any, she starts on about the light in her bedside table not working. Did you call front desk to have it fixed? I ask. No, of course she hadn't. And due to this, she was having to navigate around her room only but the light of her cell phone, which she left behind before starting on her walk down to dinner, along with her diabetes medication. How this is my fault I still dont know. 


After taking down her complaints, ensuring that she was in fact on mountain now and not in a mineshaft, I hung up and thought long and hard about where the eff she could have possibly been. 


The next day I talked it over with my agents and I think we figured out what had happend - next to the resort is a golf course. Now, if you are going out for an evening walk, this course is a good 15-20 minute walk from the village. On one of the greens is a tunnel for carts to pass through. This is the best explanation that I can come up with. Poor Betty had gotten so turned around that she walked not 5, not 10, but 15 minutes *away* from the lights of the village into pitch blackness, and ended up in this tunnel on the golf course on her way to dinner. She then very nearly had a diabetic seizure before emerging from the tunnel and making her way back to her hotel room where she promptly called me to complain. 

**TLDR:** Guest called to tell me she had fallen down a mine shaft at our resort when really she had just walked into a tunnel on the golf course at night.

So this isn't an angry customer or a stupid customer story; It's a legitimately crazy person story.

I used to work in a small call center at a factory that made boilers and furnaces. Normally we only spoke to our products' distributors, and sometimes the contractors who installed them. But occasionally we would receive calls direct from angry end users (“My boiler won't work and it's a million degrees below zero and my baby is freezing and my pipes are bursting and it's all your fault!”). We would have to calmly explain to these people that there was literally nothing we could do, since we were just the factory and didn’t employ contractors. It would be like calling the factory in Detroit when the battery died in your Chevy. 

Our coworker Steve was one of the most patient men I’ve ever known. Accordingly, many of the difficult calls were transferred to him. And that’s how he ended up speaking with Carol, an older woman who believed she had fake air ducts installed in her home for nefarious purposes. After several hours on the phone listening to Carol’s complaints, he put her on speaker phone, at which point a less tactful coworker overheard their conversation. “Is this lady crazy?” he asked. And Carol overheard. A few days later, our company received [this letter](http://imgur.com/a/M8jD5) from her in the mail.

As you can read in the letter, Carol believed that people had been tormenting her for years by breaking into her house and moving, stealing, or damaging things. Among the most memorable of these incidents was the time that they came in and reconfigured her staircase. To me, the most heartbreaking part is when she lists the things they have done, (theft, vandalism, harassment), but then laments: “And, Steve, never once have they ever knocked on the door and asked to come in!”

In some ways, I really do feel bad posting this. From reading the letter, you can tell that Carol has legitimate mental issues. But what’s the internet for if not to bask in the knowledge that other people’s problems are worse than yours? No matter how bad things get, at least you’re not convinced that people are secretly installing fake air ducts in your house, stealing your empty shampoo bottles, and reconfiguring your stairway.

This is the basic call structure for the majority of my calls today:

**MEMBER**: I don't know the log in for my spouse/gf/bf/child/other family member's online access, can you give it to me? I log in all the time, but I can't remember the password.

**ME**: So what you've just told me is that you log into an account that is not yours to make transfers, pay bills, and collect account information? 

**MEMBER**: Yeah, but I have permission. They're on deployment/sick/at work/at school/ignorant about finances.

**ME**: We have no Power of Attorney on file for this person and you are not listed as an authorized user for their online accounts. They may have given you verbal permission at one point, but there is no LEGAL paper trail saying that you have permission to do so. I would advise you and -insert member's name here- to fill out the proper paperwork and not log in under their information until it is in our system. As of now, you are committing identity theft and bank fraud. I do have to document that you have admitted to logging into this account and this call is being recorded. In the future, if this account experiences fraudulent activity, there is nothing we can do to retrieve the funds lost, because the security has been compromised. I will now have to lock access to this online account until the proper paperwork has been filled out.

**MEMBER**: ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?!?!?! BUT I DO ALL THE BANKING. I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THE MONEY AND THE BILLS. THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! HOW WILL THE BILLS GET PAID! I CAN STILL USE THE CARD, RIGHT?

**ME**: You said you use the debit card to make purchases as well? In that case, I will have to cancel the debit card and will not be able to have a new one sent out until -insert member's name- calls us to have a new one ordered OR until we get a POA on file for you. Using that debit card is bank fraud and is a federal offense. It also violates VISA's terms and conditions for the card carrier and they may lose the privilege to carry a card at all.

And that's been my day.

**TL;DR**: Do not use someone else's log in information or debit card to conduct banking transactions unless you have crossed all the T's and dotted all the I's.

I was working for the call center of one the famous fast-food chain. Not in the US, though. 

So after getting some personal information about the caller on the phone, I asked for her delivery address.

Me: ""May I know where should we deliver to, ma'am?""

Cust: ""Oh, I'm at a hospital""

Me: ""Oh, I see, would you be collecting your food at the taxi stand? Or the nurses station?"" (wanting to show some discretion)

Cust: ""Don't worry, my friend has a private ward, just deliver to ward 515""

Me: ""Sure thing ma'am, may i take your order?""

Customer proceeds to order 2 sets of meals, and an ice-cream.

Me: ""Ok ma'am, your total will be $XX.XX and will be delivered around 3.30pm""

Cust: ""Oh ok... wait, how long do i have to wait?""

Me: ""About an hour, ma'am""

Cust: ""An hour... can it be any faster? My friend is in labour and would like to have the ice cream before she gives birth.""

At which point me and the customer started laughing for about a minute.

Me: ""Ok ma'am, I'll inform the manager, but I cannot make any promises.""

Cust: ""Hahaha, yeah, ok, please try!""

So i wrote in the Special Instructions column: Please expedite order. Customer is in labour and would like the ice cream before she gives birth.

A few calls later, my co-worker told me the manager (of that particular fast food store) was looking for me. I called back.

Manager: ""Is this a joke?"" (He sounded more incredulous than angry)

Me: ""No, that is seriously what the customer told me, do you think you are able to help?""

Manager: ""Huh... so she's gonna be spreading her legs, delivering that baby, and you want my driver to walk in and pass her the food?""

Me: ""Nono, she's not delivering yet, just in labour, so please hurry!""

Manager: ""Ok, I'll try...""

After that, I got swamped with calls. Wanted to call that customer back to see if the driver managed to get the ice-cream to her on time, but other I had to deal with other customers and that issue got pushed out of my mind.

I got placed at a call center for a car rental company for eight months. Overall, the place was alright. There were eight students from my school there, everyone was really welcoming to us. It’s been a few years since I worked there, and there’s a few calls which I’ll probably never manage to totally forget, but there was one in my first few weeks which particularly sticks out: the guy who tried to teach me the difference between flying and driving.  
  
It seemed like a totally normal day, probably a little less then a week after we got put on the floor. As my phone beeped to signal the incoming call, I had no idea that I was going to get myself into. 
  
**K33l3Y**: Hi, welcome to --  
**Customer**:  908764. Fix it.  
**K**: Uhm, alright. Sir, is that a reference number of some kind?  
**CM**: Of course it’s a fucking reference number!  
**K**: Sir, usually when the booking is confirmed, the reservation   number would have either a D or an F in front of it. Which letter is in front of your –    
**CM**: No. You don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about, Ryan Air never has that!  
  
At that point, I realized the guy had probably got passed through by someone else in the company that just didn’t want to deal with him – and lucky me, I got the call. This was also the point that my supervisor decided she wanted to review my calls and had started listening in to the conversation. 
  
**K**: Okay, but sir, we don’t deal with flights here – if I can put you on hold for a moment, I will transfer you through to Ryan Air.   
**CM**: I don’t *want* to be put on hold, I want you to fix my fucking flight reservation!   
**K**: Sir, we rent cars here – we don’t have anything to do with flights…  
**CM**: No, this is Ryan Air. I know I dialed the right number.   
**K**: Sir, you’ve actually gotten through to the car rental service. We partner with Ryan Air, but we have no access to their flight information.   
**CM**: Just fix my fucking flight! 908764!  
**K**: Sir, unless you want a car, I’m afraid that all I can do is –  
**CM**: Nono, no cars – *flyyyyyyy*, not drive. In the air, not on the ground. Don’t you know the difference?!  
**K**: Yes, sir, I understand you’re looking to fix your flight reservation. Unfortuantely, as I’ve tried to explain, we cannot –   
**CM**: Don’t fucking tell me you can’t do anything! The person that transferred me through to you said the exact same thing! I don’t want to fucking drive!   
  
By now, every time the guy spoke/yelled at me, his voice seemed to go up an octave. He was starting to sound like one of the Chipmunks, or something like that. 
  
**K**: Sir, I understand, and I can transfer you through if you just let me put you on hold for a moment –   
**CM**: Do *not* fucking put me on hold, what is so fucking difficult to understand about that! Just do your job! I don’t want a fucking car, I just want you to fix. my. reservation.

**K**: Sir, I can’t. Unless you want me to transfer you or give you their telephone number, I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do.

My supervisor had leaned over and terminated the call. At that point, my supervisor and the person who was working next to me start cracking up. Apparently, the guy was shouting loud enough that the customer my co-worker was dealing with could hear him (and he was laughing along with everyone else). 
  
I was let off to go on my break, with five minutes extra for that being one of my first marked calls, and it was then that I found out the truth about the Chipmunk Man: He called often enough and always demanded something to do with Ryan Air, totally disregarding the company’s welcome message when he dialed. It was apparently some sort of weird initiation to get one of the ‘regular’ difficult customers, turns out I just got mine way earlier then any of the supervisors had expected (they were going to prepare us on what to say to deal with them). 
  
That was also the day the eight of us got pulled aside and told about the three-strike swearing rule. My supervisor was surprised I had let the guy continue to swear and had assumed that the training manager had told us. Nobody had. Oops.

At one point, one of the collections agents gets a phone call.  It's a guy who is calling asking for information from the employee.  And I'm talking about personal information, like DOB, name, etc.  Eventually the collector forwards it to their supervisor.  The supervisor is pretty incompetent to begin with, and is pretty terrible at handling any sort of escalation calls (Not sure how he became a supervisor).  Anyway, the guy hangs up.  Seems like it would be over.

Except he keeps calling back on different lines for different collectors. I suspect at this point he is most likely a disgruntled taxpayer who figures they will get a little petty revenge on the collection agency.  So the obvious option would be to block his phone number.  But we can't because he's by some means using one of our office numbers to call another office number.  So you would figure, ""Maybe we should just ignore his calls?"".

Nope.  Instead, the **ENITRE MANAGEMENT STAFF** will try to talk to this guy (who is at this point calling from multiple lines simultaneously) to try and get him to stop.  After about an hour to an hour and a half, they decide they'll just set the phones to ""Out Of Office"".  Now I get to sit around and get paid to laugh.

(long),58,6,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/1iux9o/i_dont_want_to_be_involved_in_this_claim_long/,"So I handle auto claims in the US.  For anyone who doesn't know, you're not required to cooperate with any insurance company but your own (for your own its in the policy that you must cooperate basically).  You *do* need to cooperate if you expect the other insurance company to do anything for you.  If you don't want to cooperate, you go through your own insurance and let them figure out where to send the bill.

I get a call from someone who theoretically is a claimant (wife of the other driver).  The issue is that we don't have any of their information.  She starts out the call stating she wants this process to be as easy as possible, and she doesn't want to get involved in the claim.  The thing that should be obvious here is that if she wants the claim to be quickly and efficiently handled, she should provide me the information that I request.

I request her husbands contact information (name, address, phone number) and the year, make, and model of the vehicle that he was driving.  Its at this point that things go sideways.  She keeps telling me she doesn't want to be involved.  I explain that I'm *not* involving her, but I do need the information on her husband so I can speak with him.  This is a rear end accident and *we hit them*, so it should require 2 phone calls and 15 minutes to handle provided I can contact both parties.  Instead I spend 3x that arguing with her.

Now she starts saying ""The police told me it would be better if you got the information from them"".  I laugh it off the first time and say ""Well, we can do that if we need to but it might take me 6 weeks to get the report.""  I say with her on the phone, it makes more sense to get the information from her.  She responded that she wants me to call the police and ask them (sorry, this isn't the way it works and the police would probably shoot us if we started making thousands of requests).

I reiterate that I'm only asking for basic information and that she won't have any further involvement.  I let her know this will speed up claim handling over waiting for that information to come in and that this is the easiest most efficient way of handling the claim.  She goes back to ""I don't want to be involved in this claim!"" and ""The police told me that you should get the information from them!""

At this point, I'm getting a bit irritated and say (in a polite tone) ""I understand, but I don't tell the police how to do their job"" and before I could even take that thought where I wanted to, she interrupts and says that no one is telling me how to do my job.  I guess refusing to give me basic information and trying to let misguided police dictate that through her is not telling me how to do my job.

Continue the cycle above for about 30 minutes (no shit), and I'm in awe at how unable I am to convince her that her failure to provide basic information is absurd.  This is the point where I want to say ""Look lady, stop wasting my time.  If you won't give me the information you need, get off my phone and call *your* insurance company and pay them the deductible and let them figure it out.""

Instead I say ""Ok, well provide me the information you would like to provide me, and we will do what we can"".  Then she drops the bomb:  ""What am I supposed to do with my car sitting in the shop doing nothing?""  *Seriously?*  **SERIOUSLY?**  You're going to do everything in your power to stop me from addressing your issue, then ask a passive aggressive question about how your own stupidity is going to make this take 3x longer than it needs to?

At this point, she gives me the phone number for the police station which I simply discard (its useless information).  I then put a large note in the claim about how I attempted over and over again to get information, advised her it would delay the claim, and moving on.  Over a week later, the claim still sits there with none of her husbands information in it.  I'd have resolved the claim days ago if I had his information.  Nope, we're going to wait on the police report because that is better!

The hilarious part?  If we get the other parties information weeks later and its at a shop that charges say $20 storage, that $840 is going to be on them because I did everything I could to avoid exactly that type of situation and they failed to cooperate.  I've seen shops try to charge up to $70 a day or so in this area, so saying $20 is being kind.  Police reports from this area also take forever to get, so I wish her luck!

I didn't expect my comment to blow up so much, and /u/another_new_username told me to post the outcome here :]  

So! Here is my tale.  
I work in a call center taking payments for a cell phone company. I'm not sure how much anyone knows about what I do, so I'm sorry if I'm saying stuff everyone already knows. 

 I got an irate female customer on the line, and she's already complaining about being on hold for so long and blah, blah, blah. That itself didn't irritate me just because I hear it so much. I ask for her information (you know for security verification processes), and she gets all mad because ""ALL I WANNA DO IS MAKE A PAYMENT MA'AM IS DAT SO HARD"" and just yells her information at me super quickly so of course I have to ask her to repeat it. She calls me deaf, and when I try to verify the spelling of her street (Delaware) she calls me stupid and asks me ""WHAT THE HELL KINDA EDUCATION DID YA GET MA'AM.""  I mute myself, and breathe deeply and remind myself that it will all be worth it when I can hang up (ha). I kept considering just transferring her to Escalations (People who deal with irate customers) but every time I almost do, she becomes almost bearable and I just decide to soldier through.  

So, after surviving a few more insults, interruptions, and annoyances, I finally push her payment through. Ended with our branded closing, and where I usually say ""Have a good rest of your day"", I say, in the sweetest voice I could muster, ""I hope your day is as pleasant as you are.""  I meant to hang up immediately, but something stopped me, and I waited to see how she would react. In a gruff, but restrained voice, she said, ""Ugh. Bye.""  


That doesn't sound great, but it was a lot better than I expected! Ha.

Call comes in and a guy with a noticeable hispanic accent (although not too heavy) comes on the line.  We go through the account verification, and I ask what I can do for him today. He says that when he used the short-code to check his balance for this month, it was quite a bit higher than it usually is. Since the bill hadn't arrived in the mail yet, he asked if I could take a look at what's going on.  

It was a family plan that included his line as the primary, and his wife and daughter as the secondary. The first thing that jumps out is that his daughter's line has gone WAY over her SMS limit for the month. If I remember correctly, she had the 1,000 message plan, and had used somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,500. At $0.10/message, that ended up being about $150 in overage fees. Well, that mystery was solved, time to break it to the customer...  

I explain to him where the overages came from, how they were calculated, and exactly what the difference was vs. his regular statement.  

**Customer**: ""Could you hold on for a moment, please?""  

**Me**: ""Certainly.""  

I know just enough Spanish to understand what transpired next...  

**Customer**:"" [Daughter's Name]!"" (not screaming, but definitely irritated).  

**Daughter**: ""Yes papa?""  

**Customer:** ""I found out about the phone bill. You're grounded.""  

After that, he switched back to English and came back to the call, apologizing for the absence. He asks what the options are, and I explain that he could pay the amount in full and also move the entire plan to unlimited SMS for a small increase (like $5-$10 I think). Since he had been exceptionally nice, I broke the rules a little and hinted that if he switched the SMS plan to mitigate further overages, I'd see what I could do about at least PART of the amount his daughter's line owed. The next part restored a bit of my faith in people's parenting skills.  

**Customer:** ""I'll think about the text thing some other time. What I'd like to do is just pay the full amount. But once we do that, I want you to completely block texting from my daughter's phone. I'll pay for the extra, but she's grounded, and her allowance for the next few months is going toward paying me back.""  

With that, the customer provided the payment info to bring the account up to current, made a remark that his daughter was probably going to be angry with him but she'd have to deal with it, and made it a point to thank me for helping him out. I was glad to see that there are some people in the world who are still willing to be parents first, instead of friends.  

Turns out that call was surveyed as well. Either they didn't hear me hinting about crediting the overages, or didn't care because everything else was taken care of. I got perfect marks for speed, accuracy, courtesy, and what they cared about most, FCR.",,False,self,t5_2urem,False,,,True,t3_125jg7,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/125jg7/good_parent_teaches_responsibility/,

So I get a call under ""lost/stolen""...I'm getting read to report someone's card or get a customer service call (I work till 1:30 am so....unfortunately when your banks customer service line is closed it redirects the calls to the after hour departments and we have to listen to them complain saying it should be 24h then we just say ""Call them in the MORNING"")  
  
But anyways, the call;  
...  
...  
...  
**Me:** Card services, this is Bunny, may I have your card number if you have it please?  
  
---  
An older sounding man answers  
---  
  
**Man:** Oh, you need that? Ok one moment.....  
  
---  
At this point I hear the rustling of him searching for the card and I know this guy really isn't reporting a card  
---  
  
**Me:** Sir, are you calling to report a card lost or stolen?  
  
**Man:** What? No, what did I call?  
  
**Me:** The lost and stolen department.  
  
**Man:** Oh, I believe I reached the wrong place, I'm think I'm not suppose to be here....  
  
---  
Then I he started mumbling something, I couldn't understand any of it, there was words here and there, then he would layer words on top of other words...then he finally said something I could understand  
---  
  
**Man:** Uh, ........................ it asks for my mothers maiden name, ...............I'm trying to sign...think uhhhhh....why does it do that?  
  
**Me:** Um, were you trying to activate a card, or trying to fill out a form for your bank?  
  
**Man:** NOW, I want it so when they ask for my mothers maiden name, that they also ask for my fathers!  
  
**Me:** Oh, well this is a lost and stolen department, you would have to contact customer service for that.....(wtf?)  
  
**Man:** Can you just....erghr....submit a note on my acct to do that?  
  
**Me:** No sir, I don't have access to that portion of your account, we are only able to search for your card and get only the card reported lost or stolen.  
  
**Man:** Oh, well I'm in the wrong place I guess.  
  
---  
Um...he said this earlier  
---  
  
**Me:** Yes, you would need to speak to customer service, there number should be on the back of the card or on any paperwork from the bank.
  
**Man:** But that is what I called, The number on the back....egh..uhhhhh, I got you....ugh...not 24hours then.....  
  
---  
Then he starts mumbling and babbling again where nothing is making sense  
---  
  
**Man:** Your.......at..........Bank of the Best ....................this...ughhhh....I think uhhhh Bank.... transfer me to another one there that can...ugh since you are there
  
---  
Nothing made sense at all, though he seemed kinda upset and was trying to pin something with Bank of the Best with me so  
---  
  
**Me:** Sir, I am not Bank of the Best, we are a 3rd Party after hours lost and stolen department hired by them to take their reports because they are closed, I wouldn't not be able to help you with your issue. We are also an inbound call center so we do not have the ability to transfer you, and I already told you that you had to call Bank of the Bests customer service line in the morning when they are open. 
  
**Man:** Can I have the number?  
  
**Me:** Sir, we do reports for thousands of different banks and issuers, we do not have access to all of those phone numbers, Bank of the Bests customer service number is printed on the bank of the card (Truth)  
  
**Man:** You wouldn't even know if that was my bank until now, I just told you what it was, so then you wouldn't have known what it even was earlier right? How do you know they are even closed?
  
**Me:** That is true sir, but if you were transferred here that means there line is currently closed and it is transferring the calls to the after hour departments still available.

---  
Then this is where is got really weird, he is mumbling something weird again and this is what happens  
---  
  
**Man:**..............well...........need my fathers name.........his signature........ on the card check, need the signature....  
  
**Me:** Um, sir.....I'm not understanding what you are trying to tell me....  
  
**Man:** I need..........sign my signature.....with the father......need his name.....and the......signature....  
  
**Me:** Sir, I'm not understanding what you are trying to say, I can't help you if I don't know what the problem is, I'm having a hard time trying to understand (And piece together) what youa re saying.  
  
**Man:** Oh, I must be in the wrong place.........I see.......uh...I'll call customer service in the morning when they are open...... if I am still alive......I may be dead.....signature......  
  
---  
Then......the most random thing happened  
---  
  
**Man:** Agent double Oh Nine (009) has left the building, clocking out.  
  
---  
Then before I could say anything....even though I was speechless and had no idea what just happened, my phone line went to available, he hung up  
---  
  
  
.....no idea if this man was drunk (Though sounded no where close to being drunk)......or is he was just some crazy oldish man.......either way.....it was....WEIRD

So, 6 years ago, I was working in a callcenter for the first time. It was at an outsourced call center, doing customer service for a mobile phone provider. We dealt with outages, contract matters, upgrades, all that stuff. And as usual for these jobs, nobody called us to tell us how happy they were with their service, most calls were complaints.

So my phone rings, I take the call and can get out my ""Welcome at ****, my name is Ulf, what can I...."", and off she goes. She had sent her letter of cancellation totally in time, why had her contract been renewed for another year, we had already pulled this off last year, she would see a lawyer about this, and so on.

So I took a look at our documentation, and her letter got to us one day too late, just the same as last year. I calmly tell her this, and there is the next round of yelling. We go about this a few times, and we get to the point where she accepts, that maybe, just maybe, she should have sent her letter a liiiiiiiiiittle bit earlier. Now she asks, what I can do for her to at least compensate her for the ordeal of having to deal with us for another year? The new phone she wanted, a SonyEricsson K800i, was only available with an additional payment of 100€ with the contract she had, and she expected to get this for free.

Well, we had this policy where we could credit an account with 50€ anytime we saw fit, anything above that had to be approved by a manager...none of which were available, of course. So after trying to get a hold of anyone in charge, and not finding them, I said ""fcuk that"", put in the order for the phone and credited her account the full 100€. She said something along the lines of ""Fine, but don't expect this to make up for your shit, I will still cancel my contract!"". Ok, well, nothing I can do about this.

About 30 minutes later my manager, back at his desk, calls me over and asks me if I took a call from this lady earlier. I nod and tell him what the call was about, leaving out that I exceeded my credit line. Well, apparently she called again a little later, asked for a manager (which happened to be mine), and then told him that I was the most helpful and sympathetic CSR she ever dealt with, and that after thinking about it, she would stay with our company for the great customer service. I definitely had this ""WTF?"" look on at this moment.

I thanked him and went back to my desk, when my manager said ""One more thing. That crediting her 100€...don't make it a habit, okay?"". :D",,False,self,t5_2urem,False,,,True,t3_1jy4m0,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/1jy4m0/how_i_got_away_with_being_overly_helpful/,

If you happen to frequent that sub, then you might have read this.

I used to work the information phone line for a real big campground. Not strictly ""retail"" but it fits the bill. People would call and ask questions, I would answer them. I would also book them into places and plan trips. It was a real simple job, but required a very in-depth knowledge of the campgrounds (it was a big ass place, so not as easy as it sounds). I got funny calls, stupid calls, interesting calls and one call that made me wish I'd not gotten out of bed that morning. Here's two simple stupid/funny ones.

The first one seemed simple, a guy called and was asking about the amenities available to each campsite. Well shit, I've got a whole spiel practiced and ready to go for this one.

Me: There are pumps throughout the campgrounds which provide clean drinkable water and a pump can be found about every 5-7 campsites. There are shared washrooms and showers, if you so desire. As well, there are electrical and non-electrical sections for if you have a trailer or tent respectively. (Nailed it)

Caller: Ok, but do you have any campsites with a kitchenette?

Me: Excuse me, what exactly do you mean?

Caller: Do you have any sites with a personal refrigerator or stove?

Me: Uh, no sir, we do not have campsites that come with a kitchenette.

The man asked one or two more straightforward questions before hanging up. He sounded a bit crestfallen after the initial exchange. I don't know about you, but when someone says camping, I do not think of a place with nice personal kitchen appliances.

The second call I'll talk about was a little more complex of a task. The guy called in asking about going canoe camping (where you canoe into your campsite, in contrast to car camping where you drive onto your campsite). Canoe camping can be a daunting task for those not familiar with it, as you have to choose what lakes you'll be staying the night on and how you're going to get there. This place had a map of all the available lakes and the tiny little paths connecting them all. You could buy the map from some outdoorsy retailers in neighbouring cities, in the campground itself, or find a slightly outdated .pdf version online. I was helping the guy plan his trip.

Me: If you really want to plan a trip, you're going to need a copy of [campground name]'s canoe map.

Caller: Ok, where can I get one?

Me: [List of retailers and the campground itself] Also, you can get a free outdated version online. It'd be enough to plan the trip, but you'll still have to get a physical copy.

Caller: Ok, that sounds good. How do I find the one online?

Me: Its really simple, just google ""[name of campground] canoe map pdf"" and it'll pop right up.

Caller: Sorry, how do you spell ""[name of campground]""?

Me: Oh, no problems its, N-A-M-E-O-F-C-A-M-P-G-R-O-U-N-D

Caller: Ok... and how do you spell ""pdf""?

Me: Uh...

Caller: silence

Me: pause P-D-F.

An audible groan was heard from the other end of the line, they had finally realized what just happened. The caller sheepishly thanked me and said they'd get back once a plan had been hammered out.

I was calling his wife but he picked up, so I just started with the intro like I normally would. But when I said that I'm calling from his wife's alma mater, he completely blows up! Yelling at me about how late I was calling his house (around 8:45 PM EST), I awoke his children, the school is so greedy, etc.

But then he started coming at me in particular: he started to call me a fucking idiot and constantly questioned how stupid I was and that my job is pointless and that I'm a worthless human being. Then came the threats...He said he would come to my university, somehow found out my identity, locate the call center and punch me in the face, choke me to death and I believe he also said he would stab me a couple of times. Finally I just hung up on him. I was shocked but amused at the same time. I told my boss and we laughed about it, and I continued to work until the end of my shift.

Apparently, however, I pissed this guy off so much that he took things to the next level, literally. He went online, found out who my boss was, contacted his supervisor and threatened her life too! He only left a voicemail, but how stupid can you be? Making death threats to two different people, we have all his information and now we have his cell phone, did he really think he was being inconspicuous? Anyway, the whole thing was surreal; the supervisor called the police and I was brought in for questioning about the guy. I told them everything and they asked if I wanted this ""case"" to be further investigated, I politely declined. I was not even faded by the whole thing and the only reason that the supervisor called in the first place was because she was concerned for my safety since I am technically one of her employees as well.

I had been working at this particular ISP for about 2 years, unfortunately there was no chance of promotion as it was a huge call centre. Not that it really mattered as my wife and I were moving to the other side of the country in a few days.

For some reason the fates knew it was my last day, and I got shitty call after shitty call. Filled with abuse and just general unpleasantness. And as it so happened I was taking my final call of the day. My final call for this company.. well, this poor bastard really had no idea what he got himself into. 

He was one of those guys that just pushed all your buttons. Well, he didn't so much as push mine, but rapidly headbutt them.

He never swore at me, but he was very smug. We've all gotten someone who just talks down to you because they think they are better then you. This drove me up the fucking wall.

It was a general tech support issue. Nothing major. 
When the call drops in, all the clients info pops up on the screen as normal. It took me about 5 minutes to actually figure out the problem - his router had crashed and needed a simple reboot. 

I informed the dude of this and that's when I started getting the attitude. Apparently I didn't know what was wrong as this issue reoccurs constantly. A powercycle only fixes it for about 10 minutes and he hasn't been able to be online for long before it boots him. I checked his records - he'd been connected for over 9 hours solid - and receiving data. 

I told the guy that I can see all the information to know that hes been connected and downloading. He called me a liar and quite rudely suggested I find someone who knows whats going on because I was quite ""stupid""

""No""

""What do you mean no?""

""Exactly that. No. I know whats going on, I can see it in front of me and you will not be speaking to anyone else""

""I demand to speak to someone else - I don't need your help anymore""

""Well, clearly you do. Remember, you called me""

This dude lost it at this point and started screaming - loudly. And to the point where his voice was breaking and it was more like a squeal.
And I don't know why it slipped out, but I started laughing.. a lot. 
I didn't hit the mute, nor hold. I just laughed at him. 

""WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?!""

""Well, you see, when you scream like that, your voice, it.. it goes high pitch and you start sounding like a chipmunk.""

""I want to speak to your manager!""

*me between laughter*
""Yeah.. that's not gunna happen. You see, you called on my last day. So I don't care what you want. I'm just treating you like you deserve to be treated. This outta teach you to be slightly more respectful to people you want help from.""

""I'll call back and complain""

""So? Last day. Remember? I told you about 20 seconds ago? Call back. Complain. What're they going to do? Sack me?""

I kept laughing at him and hung up. 
I then packed my stuff and left.

About 2 weeks later I got an sms from my old manager who had just listened to the call recording and she was... not impressed. 
When she called the guy back to apologize he told her he had completely forgotten about the call but now he's been reminded he wanted compensation. 

Glad I wasn't there anymore. 

Don't get me wrong, I was employed for 2 years because I did my job - and did it well. But there is only so much abuse one takes before you either don't give a shit anymore or get yourself sacked. I guess I was lucky the timing just worked out perfectly.

We'd get a lot of calls that were supposed to go to a major electronics company because our numbers were somewhat similar.

Our phone system says the name of the company several times, and there's no mistaking our services for that of the electronics manufacturer.  At one point, the calls were coming in so frequently that we considered adding an option to our system to automatically route them away from our company, but we decided that wasn't professional for our *real* customers.

Anyways, many people would actually argue with me that they *had* called the right number, as if that's possible at all.  We had some fun with these guys.  My favorite prank was this:

""Alright, this is going to sound funny, but we've got a problem with our phone system.  I'm going to route you out now, but I need you to do something for me.  I'm going to give you a number, and when you hear someone pick up, say CODE RED, then read the number.  The system's completely automatic, so DO NOT STOP READING THE NUMBER for any reason.""

Customer: ""OK.""

I'd then give them an extremely long number and transfer them to one of my coworkers, who would freak out when they heard a person saying ""CODE RED"" and then start rattling off numbers.

However, my favorite was a woman who called about her microwave.  She couldn't set the clock.  It was at the end of a long day, and I'd just talked to a bunch of real customers, and this lady was *rude.*  I was about to tell her the right number, but I realized she's just take it out on some other poor sap.  *Don't worry, stranger,* I thought, *I'll handle this asshole for you.*

So I looked up the manual for the microwave and gave her instructions.  

ME: ""...and then just press the Clock button again.""

HER: ""You're not being very clear.""

ME: ""You can't find the clock button? ""

HER: ""No, I just think you could be a little more clear.  Don't they train you?""

ME: ""No.""

HER ""...what?""

ME: ""This isn't even the right number.  You're trying to reach XXX-XXXX.""

HER: ""...then who are you?""

ME: ""Just some guy.""

HER:""....why did you help?""

ME: ""I don't know.  Fuck you.""

We had recently had a new system implemented that would track our call times and break times based on us putting in a code to set our phone to ""away"" mode if we needed to grab a coffee, go to the toilet, etc. We'd also be set as ""away - no explanation"" if we missed a call. The idea was was that if we went over a certain ""away"" or ""break"" time per day, we'd be counselled on it.

We were also given a brief 1 minute window after each call that was for finishing up file notes etc. once the customer hung up, but we could manually set ourselves to available if we didn't need the time.

Shortly after this system was implemented, we had a heavy call day and a lot of calls in the queue. Now the lines close at 5pm but something my coworkers didn't understand (or more likely PRETENDED not to understand) was that calls already in the queue STAYED in the queue.

If your call ends at, say, 5:01pm, you would go into ""file note"" mode until 5:02pm, at which point your phone would ring again if there were people waiting.

On this day, this perfect storm of call volumes and lazy co-workers, everyone wrapped up their calls on or about 5pm and promptly logged out of their phones while they were still in ""file note"" mode so they could leave for the day. If they had set themselves to ""available"" they would of course received another call.

In a team of 20 people, I was the ONLY person to continue taking calls that were in the queue, and as a result was stuck in the office by persistent people staying on hold until 7pm.

The next day, I was taken aside by my manager and abused for it, and it took me a good half hour to explain the above. At which point he actually apologised and called a meeting to explain this to the whole team, to ensure it wouldn't happen again. This took nearly 45 minutes(!) for everyone to grasp at which point there were protests that ""it's not fair"" that they should be expected to keep answering calls ""after the lines have closed"".

My manager then pointed to me and asked ""what's more fair, everyone staying back fifteen minutes to take one or two more calls, or kermi42 staying back for 2 hours while customers are kept on hold?"".

I wish that this had resulted in a rush of sympathy, I really do. But no, I was anathema in the team from that day forth. Resented for being a victim, hated for flagging an issue that meant there were days where people got home a little later, scorned for being ""that guy"".

About 15 years ago I did phone support for Prodigy Internet. One day corporate says, ""hey, all these tech support calls are expensive - we need to figure out a way to make money off this"".
So they hook up with some outfit offering ""credit reports for one dollar"". At the end of each call we're supposed to say ""before we end our call tonight, would you like to speak with someone about an exciting opportunity to get your credit report for one dollar"". If yes, we transfer the call to this company. We're supposed to do this - no exceptions.
Well, we all thought it was bullshit and we tried to offer it selectively. I got dinged quite a few times and my quality ratings were taking a hit. Finally, I say screw it - I'm going to offer this crappy service to everyone and do it with a smile just to show how idiotic it is.
So one night I get a call from this gentleman who hasn't been able to get online in weeks. I check his area and can see he's dialing into one of our 800 numbers that never work it's nearly always down. I know there is absolutely nothing I can change in his settings. I look at all his call notes and everything things been gone over - he's essentially screwed.
I can't remember if I told him flat out there's was nothing I could do or if I made some attempt to change some settings. End result was he was pissed. He complained about the service, threatened to cancel,etc.
Finally he's pretty much vented everything out of his system and we go to end the call. I drop the line about his chance for an exciting opportunity for only a dollar and the guy goes TOTALLY, bat-shit f'in crazy. I can not stress enough how high this guy went into orbit. He totally lost his shit on me.
So, he rips me new one, tells Prodigy to F themselves and says he's cancelling, and slams the phone down. Before I get a new call, I get a little tone in my ear letting me know I'm getting an internal call.

A few years back I was working for the Frequent Flyers program for one of Australia's larger airlines.  

So anyway I was at my desk this day when a call dropped in, before even got past the intro this guys comes over the line screaming that we where all fucking bastards and we where all useless.  As much as I wanted to terminate the call then we had to give them 3 warnings so I raised my voice cut him off and told him that if he didn't calm down I'd terminate the call.  This worked as it usually did so after he calmed down I asked him what the problem was.  He tells me that he was on a flight from LAX- SYD and he was removed from the flight though no fault of his own.  Knowing this wouldn't happen I asked him for the full story.

It turns out that he abused the cabin crew because he had to have a aisle seat in the middle row and not the window row.  When he couldn't get his own way he started acting out being verbally abusive and then started to threaten the cabin crew with violence.  At that point the cabin crew called airport security and had him removed from the flight and placed on another flight leaving the next day (to give him time to cool down).  Due to this he felt that he deserved some sort of compensation for his trouble and the humiliation that he felt being led of the plane. 

When he was done I calmly told him that I was not willing to provide said compensation and that the flight crew was within there right to have him removed.  This set him off again.  He was going to sue me, sue the company, sue LAX, sue the airport security.  He was a vertran and a loyal customer of this airline (looking at his bookings this was the only flight he'd taken with us and it had been booked with credit card points.)  Anyway this went on for about another 5 minutes of him screaming and me telling that we where going around in circles before my senior gave me the O.K to end the call.

One evening, I received a call from a gentleman who was concerned about his phone bill, that every morning at precisely five thirteen, he was being billed for an eight second call to a national number.

I looked through his bills and discovered that this had been going on for some months, and that in total this call had cost him around thirty pounds.  

He was not a happy subscriber.

No one was awake in his house at that time in the morning, and who could make eight second long phone calls with that sort of precision?!  It was obviously a fault on the phone line and something his telephone provider should fix immediately.  

Further investigation revealed the call to be to a company that provides home security, it was a house alarm making the call every morning to check it was working or whatever it is that they do.

I suggested to the gentleman that he contact the company who run the alarm, as they had an alternative number that would be free on his call package.

No, this was not to be borne, he did not agree to the alarm making the call, and so his telephone provider should contact his house alarm provider to get them to reimburse him for his phone bill incurred through their alarm making unauthorised telephone calls.

It was patently fraud, and I clearly did not care that he was being ripped off by the company I was working for, did I not have an ounce of self respect in working for such an employer?

I tried to reason with him. His house came with a house alarm that was in working order.  It is up to him to understand how that house alarm functions.  He was using the house alarm and it was using the phone line, he was benefiting from the phone line being in use by the alarm and something at his address was indeed making the calls.

He wouldn't contact the previous owner to complain that the carpets that were in the house when he moved were not to his liking, so would he do so when the house alarm arrangements were similarly displeasing to him?

Before I can explain to her why a problem might return after she hangs up with us, she informs me that she will not be spending ""much time"" on the phone, nor will she be doing any troubleshooting steps.

""I am trying really hard not to yell at you right now,"" Janette from Williamsburg bellows in my ear, ""and I will talk to a supervisor!""

No, she refuses to even answer my basic questions about what the issue is and how long it has been occuring and so on. She gets progressively more hysterical as I try, so I just let her cool off on hold.

Floor support finally shows up 20 minutes later. They're always busier than a one legged man in a butt-kicking contest, so that's about expected. I should mention that I'm in a technical specialist department for this contract; our floor support doesn't know even a third of the stuff we do for actual troubleshooting; what they're good at is policy. They are there to authorize refunds and escalations and the like. So now Janette from Williamsburg has managed to scream herself into a worse predicament than she started in.

Floor support takes the call, and right away I can see the poor guy's face fall as he realizes I wasn't kidding when I described the caller. At one point he had the internal web database pulled up to the ""legal threats against [famous consumer electronics company]"" pulled up so he'd have the script ready to go if she went there.

And about 30 minutes later, after he'd managed to squeeze in a word or two edgewise, we--and there's a bit of a crowd by this point, since sup calls in my department are rare, so everyone on a break gathered 'round to hear what was up--hear the floor support start trying to de-esclate her from asking for another supervisor.

Well he failed of course.

We look around and we see one of the [lead tech specialists] and he asks us what's going on. ""We've got a sup-sup"" we tell him.

""Hold on! I've got just the guy for that!"" He wooshes off.

Sadly, he wasn't able to find this perfect candidate for the job. (We don't actually have sup-sups on tap, since these calls almost never happen.) He took the call himself, and after a few minutes of cursory de-escalation he started giving her instructions. 8 minutes later the issue is resolved.

So I've been working retail for most of my working career (a whopping 5 years spent at a department store and two fast food places, 5 years too many if you ask me). However I have transcended retail and must now forgo posting in /r/TalesFromRetail and post here, my new haunt.


So I work for a company that supplies outsourced customer service to some pretty big companies. I work in the division that services a department store that largely deals in electronics and similar fare. Our job is to take chats all day and largely act like a massive placebo, pretending like we're useful, but in actuality all of the information we have access to is readily available to the customer in some form or another. And if it's not we can't give it to them.


So 50% of my job is pretty much telling people they have to call the hotline number to solve their problem, and another good chunk of it is educating customers in our policies.


""Sorry our return policy is only X days.""


...


""Yes I am aware I'm cold-hearted monster ma'am, but our return policy does not cover the item you bought three years ago and ran over with your lawnmower."" (true story)


The rest of it is spent shopping for customers too lazy or incompetent to work the search bar at the top of the website. However, as is to be expected of a company that largely sells electronics, there are a few people who come into the chat expecting some sort of tech support. Ordinarily I just redirect them to the division that actually handles our tech support, but since they charge for the service, sometimes I'll help out with the small stuff. May as well put my computer certifications to use eh? I regret it every damn time.


So here's the first one:


This lady chats in saying that she bought a hard drive and the USB cable that came with it doesn't fit into the computer. Now I show her some pictures and ascertain that the HD has multiple USB slots, among them a USB A and a USB B. Funny thing, the cable has a USB A on one end, and a USB B on the other. Most computers only have a USB A on them. It took me fifteen minutes of questioning to end up telling the customer to flip the cable around and try plugging the A end into the computer and the B end into the HD. This was followed by the inevitable:


""Oooooohhhhh.""


I mean really? Was that too hard to figure out? The worst part was this wasn't the first time it had happened this week. The other one was 25 minutes and extended well past closing time because the customer was trying to plug the USB B into the computer and the USB A into the printer. I figured this out ten minutes into the conversation and told her to flip it around, it took me another ten to realize that I had to specifically instruct her to plug it into the back of the printer, not the front.


""I see! My bad.""


The other five minutes was me telling her how to install programs from a disc.


But the chat I had tonight took the damn cake. It lasted a good 13 minutes past closing, and it should have lasted five minutes total. We have a loyalty program that has its own separate account on a different website. You can link the account with the account on the main site so that all of your orders automatically register with the program without you entering it each transaction.


So this customer chats in and says they can't log in. It takes me a good five to seven minutes to figure out they're trying to log in using their loyalty account. I explain that they actually need to use their main website account to make transactions, but that they can conveniently link the two so they don't have to enter it during each transaction. We spend a few minutes trying to figure out if they have an account and I determine they do and give them the email used to create the account. It says the username/password doesn't exist so I give them the instructions to reset their password.


A few minutes pass and they say.


""Okay. So how do I use my loyalty on the website?""


I assume everything is in the clear and they have their account all ready to go. Hahaha, classic me. Following this was 15 minutes of absolute frustration. I kept giving them instructions, telling them to go to ""My Account"" and find specific links; there were multiple ways to hook them up together. And the customer kept coming back to me with, ""I don't see them."" ""I can't find it."" ""Are you sure your information is right?"" Towards the end I literally copy/pasted the contents of the damn page to the customer into the chat and said, 


""So you see none of this on the My Account screen?""


""No! I just see a place where it tells me to log in! None of that's there!""


I am absolutely mortified as I stare at the screen wordlessly, mouth open. Are you @#$%ing serious!? So in the end it turns out they never actually reset their password, so I had to walk them through the process again and then I finally meticulously explained every little detail and listed every step, assuming nothing. They thanked me for my patience and left.

\

hello, I work in a call center and this is my rant.

I work at a call center that's name starts with uni and ends with SYS. on a project supporting a very large software company. 



I don't usually take calls in this call center I do some tool programming for the tools that the other agents do to make their jobs easier. spending hours apon hours doing this programming in a phone code I have been given for this task. also called a NR code.

as I wandered into work this morning at 1:00 am to start my shift I found out that everyone will be getting a raise. I was excited by this as a raise is a good thing. the night sup started calling others into the back training room one by one and they all came out with smiles on their faces. 


&gt; fast forward a few hours


my turn comes around and im taken into the back for my turn chatting with the sup. turns out not only will I not be getting a raise my pay is being docked 1$ per hour and im being put on a written warning. the reason you may ask? 


my NR time is too high. it turns out. they are not exempting my time that I spend doing this tool programming because its not relevant to the job. turns out the manager that has been asking me to do the programming didn't tell anyone that's what I have been doing in this NR code and has been claiming that he is writing these tools. this manager has also been getting bonuses for these tools that ""he"" is writing. bonuses to the effect of $1000 or so. I went to talk to HR but they said its my word agenst his and their is nothing they can do.


tl;dr: time to get a new job

edit: spelling


(UPDATE)

I have found another job installing fiber optics for data centers with a significant pay raise and good benifits. so im leaving this god forsaken place. I have left a surprise in the code that I will be handing off unfinished to that manager at the end of the week. I suspect when I don't show up on Friday they will attempt to call my cell. only then will they learn that I canceled that number and am not interested in helping them in anyway will they be sunk.",,False,self,t5_2urem,1350394141.0,,,True,t3_10zmxr,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/10zmxr/raises_all_around_except_you/,

I work at a largely online insurance company, so we end up on the phone 90% of the day. I work essentially as an intern, so I can't advise anyone legally or go super into details. I picked up a woman's call, and was greeted by a terse 'hello'. I went through my little script as I checked her file, and noticed that we have her listed as a candidate for professional insurance. Perfect, super easy. She continues to say that she sent in an email, which cryptically contains a reference to general liability insurance that we also sell. Confused, I ask her what the issue was, and the following ensued.

Me: So you want quotes for two different policies?

Her: No, I want the general coverage.

M: Ma'am that isn't possible, you've been quoted for professional insurance, we would have to re-quote with a new application etc. etc.

H: I want to speak with [my manager] right now.

M: She's actually on another call at the moment. 

Inexplicably, at that moment, she lost it. Started screaming at me, calling me incompetent, insulting me, all the usual stuff. I shut off my brain and just went through my escalation script, saying that I would have someone call her back. She then attacks me saying that we had stated that anyone here could help her, and clearly I could not. Whatever, don't need your sass today. She ends the call, I go on a nice little 20 minute walk to clear my head, meanwhile my manager calls her back, and repeats what I said pretty much verbatim. She gets off the phone and says that she's going to requote her for general liability, so exactly what I had suggested. Felt good to be right.

1375380876.0,45,self.talesfromcallcenters,1jicmq,The time I accidentally laughed loudly at an annoyed customer.,61,16,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/1jicmq/the_time_i_accidentally_laughed_loudly_at_an/,"Hey guys, first time poster, etc.

Anyway, I just finished a 10-month long employment period with a large UK based company that purchases CD's, DVD's, plus some clothing and the like from customers from pretty much all over Europe.

I worked in an inbound-call based Customer Services department, and as expected dealt with my fair share of pissed off customers and general dicks. 

I thought I'd drop by and tell you about an occasion where I accidentally and very loudly laughed at an annoyed customer.

------------------------------------------

This instance occurred on a fairly slow-going day, not too many calls, nothing too frantic. As a result of this, lots of the call centre staff are sat around without phones to answer, and so are quietly responding to customer emails. At the time of this call, I was the only person in my intimidate vicinity not taking a call, so everyone is listening to whatever I'm saying during this call. A female customer rang in and was absolutely livid from the moment I took the call. She got an email from us to say that when their parcel of items arrived at our warehouse, we found that some items were missing from the parcel.

So far, this is nothing too out of the ordinary. Its a pretty busy warehouse, so usually instances such as this arise when someone makes a mistake and maybe puts something in a pile they shouldn't have, or maybe a parcel was sent to the wrong sorting department by mistake. These problems are resolved really easily nine times out of ten.

I can practically sense that this customer is simmering on the edge of exploding throughout this call. They've already screamed at me with the usual '**HOW DARE YOU SAY I HAVEN'T SENT MY ITEMS. YOUR COMPANY IS A COMPLETE SCAM. I SENT EVERYTHING TO YOU**', and my assurances that its probably someone minor mistake have just about calmed them down enough for me to start asking for the info I need to get this resolved for them.

So, I'm explaining to the customer that I'm going to need to take some information from them. A tracking number, the courier's name, basically anything that will help us get this shit sorted out.


Now, as I am in the middle of saying to the customer that I will need a physical description of their parcel, the colleague sitting next to me very casually interrupts the final part of my sentence with *'of what you're wearing'*, so the sentence I hear is *'I'm going to need a physical description / of what you're wearing'*.

Now, its also worth mentioning that I have the sense of humour of a 13 year old school-boy, so this is the kind of thing I can have a bit of a giggle about. I stifle back my first little giggle at this joke by biting my lips together, no wanting to laugh at the customer. As they customer starts to go on a very lengthy description of what their parcel looked like, the fact that I'm not allowed to laugh makes this whole thing funnier. At this stage my condition has worsened from mild giggle to full laugh, and it is becoming harder and harder to fight it. Soon, biting my lips isn't enough to suppress this laugh. I have to forcefully try to keep my jaw together to hold back this monster. Not only that, the sentence *'I'm going to need a physical description of what you're wearing'* keeps running through my mind, and each time its funnier and funnier. The laugh is still growing in strength like some sort of Dragonball Z villain as they charge up an attack.

This is too much for just me to bear, and this is evident in the reaction of the offending colleague next to me. He sees that I'm trying not to laugh, and finds it funny. He starts to laugh, but tries to choke it back. He is sat next to me almost shaking with how much he is trying not to laugh at me. I can see that he is trying not to laugh, and this just makes things funnier for me. I am desperately trying to will myself to remain silent at this point, the customer is finishing up their description, and I know it will be my turn to talk soon, but I genuinely don't know if I'm up to the task. I have no idea if I will be able to suppress this mighty belly beast trying to push itself though my throat and down the phone at this pissed off woman.

If she hears me laugh, she's going to be annoyed. She has finished talking, its my turn now. I'm panicking. Panicking with laughter. I don't know if I can do this. I know I need to say something to by myself a few more seconds, but I can't say anything to buy myself that time. The words come out of my mouth, but I don't speak them, I squeak them. I make a high-pitched little chirp that I rush, wanting to get the words out an done with as quickly as I can, saying *'Imjsutgonnamakeanoteofallthat'*.

I'm struggling to write down the things she said to me, but am doing it to distract myself. I genuinely start to try and think of dead puppies to distract myself. At this point, other people sat around me start to notice the inhuman noise I just somehow produced, and turn to see me and my colleague trying savagely not to laugh. I've pushed my entire fist into my mouth and my shoulders are going up and down like jack-hammers, my entire body is shaking from the unimaginable force of trying to keep this laugh under wraps.

I can't speak. I genuinely can't say anything to this woman for fear I will break. Everyone else around me starts to laugh out loud. People have to get up and leave the room to make things easier for me. It has now been a very noticeable few seconds since I have said anything, and the customer's patience is wearing thin, and they want answers. They say *'...well?!'* to recieve only more silence. 

My entire body is shaking. There are tears rolling down my face and I am in genuine pain from suppressing laughter for this long. Everyone around is laughing out loud and its time for me to speak.

I start to talk but can't hold back the occasional slip. *'Okay Madam, thanks a lot for...pfft...giving...fffuuup...me that information'* I think at this point they can tell that something is wrong, as they seem to go completely quiet. I've got to keep talking and try again, but this time its just too much. I completely lose it. *'I'm goifffppppp...goinstttuuppp... I'm going to pass this alohohoahahahaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA'*

The laughter erupted out of me like a dam that's just given way to the immense force of the ocean. That's it. I've broken. I've laughed at an annoyed customer and cant stop myself. Everyone around me is in complete hysterics and my colleague next to me completely turns away from me so I cant see him laughing. I keep laughing without the ability to stop for another good few seconds. 

The customer has gone completely silent. After a few seconds they break the silence with *'Are you okay?'* I just about manage a quick *'no'* before breaking into another burst of laughter and a barrage of apologies.

Anyway, the customer seemed a bit too stunned to be annoyed, and finished the rest of the call in a pretty nice tone. I apologised as much as I possibly could, took their info, passed it to the relevant people and got everything sorted for them.

Then we all lived happily ever after.

Essentially customers would call and either 1. place an order, or 2. complain about an order.  Complaints were a total clusterfuck, involving everything from ""it didn't look like the picture on the website,"" to it never even fucking showed up.  Dozens and dozens of stories about the complaints.  This story however has to do with a woman placing an order.  

So I greet the call ""thanks for calling xxx.com how can I help you?""  The caller sounded like an elderly woman from the south.  She explains that she would like the a dozen roses delivered to an address in the Bronx.  I say of course Ma'am I can help you.  I quote her 90 dollars for the roses if they are coming from one of our local florists.  She flips out and says that she doesn't even have 90 dollars.  At this point I'm like ok great another hit against my stats for a failed sale.  BUT I offer her the option of a dozen roses shipped via fedex in a box from one of our mass vendors, which sells for 20 bucks.  She agrees.  I'm like WIN!

So I begin to go through the process of asking her the shipping information.  She gives me an address in the Bronx New York, name, etc.  I ask her what message she'd like on the card, she gives me long story short ""to xxx I'm insanely in love with you signed yyy. "" 

So I start on her billing information.  Name and address was the same as the recipient.  I was like what the actual fuck?  But I continued and asked her for her credit card.  

She says ""I don't have a credit card.""  I inform her that when paying for things from a website you need a credit card.

She responds by asking where she can get a credit card. 

 At this point I realize that I have been on this call for 12 minutes or so, Goal is like 5.  AND I'm not making a sale.  We are NOT allowed to disconnect a customer for any reason.  

I tell her she can easily get a prepaid visa/mastercard whatever if she wants.  She does not understand.  She demands that I give her a credit card.  I tell her I can't do that (fuckin obviously,) she demands a supervisor as she begins to scream and cry.  

Supervisor had been listening to the last part of the call because she had noticed I had been on one call for 12 minutes.  She was already behind me so I literally just handed her my headset.  Stood up and let her sit at my cubicle. 

 After the supervisor saying the same thing I did, the caller demanded me back (de-escalation??)  At which point my manager is basically silently apologizing to me for my call stats being destroyed and reminding me that I cannot disconnect her.  I google Visa and find the 1800 number, give this number to the crazy woman and tell her to call them then call us back.  

TL:DR:  This crazy old lady wanted to send flowers to herself pretending they were from someone else, and then didn't know what a credit card was.  She asked me to give her a credit card.

The company I worked for had a policy of call handlers not giving their full name to callers, as it was not relevant, and we had had some personal threats (people not wanting to pay bills that were due would regularly decide it was the call handler who personally felt that they should overpay, because we are all meany mean faces who don't get paid enough).

Anyway, it was late at night, about ten to ten when a call came through from a gentleman with a strong accent.  He identified himself as a Texan, and refused to conduct any further business without knowing my surname.  I assured him that I was happy to help him, and preferred to be known by my first name in this instance.  I invited him to call me by my first name, but he insisted, until I relented and gave him the initial of my family name. He said I was impolite to ask him to refer to me by my first name.  

Now being referred to as Miss K, I spent the next half hour listening to him shout at me about how his service has been suspended due to non-payment of a bill.  He was very stubborn and ignorant, frequently talking over me, repeating himself and not allowing me to explain to him how his bill came to be how it was.

This is more about silly management rather than a tale about customers.

TL;DR: Gave up 4-day weekend to do a specific worktype. Did not get to do said worktype. Complained and got to go home early. Waiting to see if it comes back to bite me.

Generally my days consist of crappy base calls for a few hours ending the day with a few hours of the much better webchat support. A few weeks ago I decided to split up my 4 day weekend to cover for one of my co-workers, who just handles a specialty line (again much better than the base line). As it has for a few weeks, my schedule today shows me on the specialty line.

I feel I should mention In recent times, I **NEVER** pick up extra hours. Because as with today, the same thing has always happened.

Log in this morning, first call beeps in, base call.

Message my supervisor, says she'll talk to the schedulers to get it fixed. 

An hour goes by, no changes. 3, 4, still nothing. At this point I decide to talk to my sup directly. 

I find out that almost a year after we had switched telephony systems, that supervisors and even the schedulers/sup's boss, the call center manager herself does not have access to the scheduling system for assigning work types.

Conversation went close to:

[convo]

 ""Hey [supname], you hear back from the schedulers yet?""

Nope not yet.

""What's it show in the IM, are they even there?""

No it still shows all of em are away.

""They all went on vacation at the same time, huh? Well if I'm on my normal worktypes then I go on chat now right?""

Nope, you're covering for [co-worker], she doesn't do chat, right?

""No she doesn't, she is dedicated (specialty line), which is what my schedule says is what I was supposed to have been doing since this morning""

Sorry, if you are covering for someone that only takes calls, that is what you need to be doing

""That's fine, but [co-worker] just takes specialty calls, not base,  which is the major reason I decided to cover the hours. You know I never pick up extra hours unless they say the lines will be down, and this is why. This has happened before, we've talked about it before, and if you want we can go into the back room and talk about it again.""

I'm on lunch right now but I will talk to [call center manager] about it later, since this shouldn't be happening and we should be able fix this is the future 

[/convo]

At this point I feel really bad about bringing this up on her lunch break, and it totally isn't her fault, but I was on mine too and she is the one i'm supposed to go to for this kinda crap.

The good news? They agreed with me, and said that I don't have to cover for [co-worker] for the rest of the day since I CAN""T actually cover for her.

That being said, it's a call center. I am expecting them to pull something. Either that this will go against me, or they will try to penalize [co-worker] saying she didn't get someone to cover for her.

When you get a good rep and the reason you are calling in is you screwed something up and want them to fix whatever problem it is that YOU caused and company policy dictates the rep simply cannot give you the unicorn ride you so desperately desire

Giving a resounding NO to the all important question does NOT hurt the company...in fact you just saved them money by paying the poor rep who had the bad luck to be the one to take your call less money

Ever wonder why you keep getting bounced from department to department over and over?  We keep track in the remarks of your account how you acted last time you called and it will show if you were an ass(written in a very nice way of course)

You are now a hot potato and whoever ends up with you is the one who potentially gets the bad survey because you screwed over the last guy and no one wants to talk to you because they will get whatever survey you leave

This is my first post with this subreddit, and I've read through quite a lot of your stories (good to know that there are many other people dealing with the brain dead!). Anyway, onto the call.

Let me just start with I'm only working in a call center for a clothes company for the last year and a half and have dealt with a lot of calls. Screamers, swears, insults, I've had them all and was able to take it no problem. This one was the first that made me angry after the call.

The call itself happened today, where she had called 30 minutes after our lines opened up. She complained about first, her order was ""Mis-delivered"" and she didn't understand why. Not only that, but she also wanted to talk about an $6-700 order that went missing.....in February. Which was delivered and signed for. After trying to contact the post office, I eventually rang her back, letting her know that I couldn't get through.

This is when she decides that I haven't been doing my job, and and started demanding I get her this out of stock dress. The conversation went along like this;

&gt;Me: ""Well, unfortunately, we are currently out of stock, and we can't get any-""

&gt;Her: ""No. I refuse to accept this. This is the second time this has happened to me, and I want that dress. I have friends in your company, and will raise all kinds of hell.""

&gt;Me: ""We can certainly try and get the dress, however, you can reach out to your friends, but-""

&gt;Her: ""Don't you dare try and appease me.""

&gt;Me: ""I wasn't trying to ma'am, however, can I confirm that your address was 123 Fake St., in City, State, and XXXXX?""

&gt;Her: ""No, my zip is XXXYY.""

&gt;Me: ""Well then, that is the problem and why the package was not delivered. When you were putting in the ad-""

&gt;Her: ""It was NOT my fault! I have had packages delivered here before, this was a mistake in YOUR system! I have NEVER modified my shipping address! You know what? You're useless, I want to speak to your Supervisor, whats your name?""

&gt;Me: ""My name is Zexionidas, and I will be leaving notes on your account. I'll put you through now.""

&gt;Her: ""Actually, before you do that, what about my missing order?""

&gt;Me: (had previously spoken to a Supervisor about this)""Unfortunately, because of the amount of time that has passed, we're not going to be refunding or crediting the money.""

&gt;Her: ""I want a Supervisor now, and don't think I will be raising all kinds of hell.""

&gt;Me: ""Certainly, two moments.""

Took her number as no Supervisors were available, but sent a message to the available Supes, ended the call and went home. Apologies if this is a wall of text, just still annoyed by it.

TL;DR Member put in the wrong zip code, and blamed our system for it, and then was pissed because we would not refund her for an order that went ""missing"" months ago.

Onto the doozy though:

I was working late, fixing up computers (the reason I was hired in the first place) when I got a call from a private number. It was an irate customer complaining that we were changing his interest rate(something we have no control over). We work through this and it turns out he missed a payment and didn't realise. Not an issue, set it up for him to make it up and waive the late fee since he honestly didn't know (plus he was nicer after he realised it was his fault)

Next morning I get a call from the same guy complaining we changed his interest rate, it was the first call for the day and I wanted to see where he was going. I told him an agent had helped him the night before and he starts to pour out lies about how I abused him, threatened his family and he just wanted to get me off the phone. I inform him I took his call last night and that his late fee was 'unwaivable'. Anger ensues

A few weeks go by and I get the same guy, same story. I tell him the same thing and that he is now well overdue. He screams profanities and hangs up the phone. 5 minutes go by and I'm met with yet another call, this time from his son. 

The son explains that their business is failing and they are about to go under,so I explain the process of liquidation and bankruptcy. All nice and polite. We end up taking a $600 payment as ""goodwill""

Not one week later I get a letter from a solicitor advising that the callers are going to sue me, not the company ME, for harassment and bullying the customer into making a $3,000 payment. Company gets involved and I end up going to court over me explaining their failing business' best options. 

Case gets thrown out, as one would expect, but did this stop them? Oh no, I get calls from them from start to finish, every day for a week. So I discuss it with our solicitor and technically they aren't harassing me, they're harassing the company so the company goes to court and end up winning around $10,000 in compensation (way too much). 

So finally I don't have to deal with these morons anymore, right? Wrong. 

The file comes up again on my workload and I see that they're now uncontactable, no calls, letters, door knocks, nothing gets through. So I send a text to both numbers.  My phone is immediately ringing, the son. He tells me his dad killed himself over owing so much money and trying to grief me into apologizing and waiving everything. (I can't, I don't have that level of power) I give an extension, hang up and another call, it's the dad. 

The dad says his son has just disappeared and he's in such grief, he can't deal with it!

They still owe the company money and I'm sure they do this with other companies, but I've had it removed from my caseload. 

TL;DR father and son try to sue me because they didn't have any money to pay back a debt. Harass me, get sued and then lie about horrible family situations.

I used to work for one of the larger mortgage servicing companies as a collections agent, and we would do call blending (both inbound and outbound calls). 

Roughly 7 nanoseconds after I push the 'ready' button on our phone software, my first call comes in. People who have worked in anything related to credit knows there's information you have to verify before you can release any account specific information, because it could be anybody on the line. This guy wants to be difficult about it, which is fine, nothing I haven't seen before:

“Thanks for calling _____ _____ Home Mortgage, can I have your name and loan number please?”

Agitated tone: “xxxxxxxxxx” (I see right away this borrower is about 8 months past due)

“Alright I have the account up, could you verify your full name and property address please?”

“ISN'T IT RIGHT THERE ON YOUR SCREEN??”

“Yes sir I have your full account information in front of me, we need you to verify the correct information for security purposes”

“DON'T GIVE ME THAT BULLSHIT! Rage rage rage..” 

I'll spare you the tumultuous details, but about 5 agonizing minutes later we finally get to the point where we can start even having a conversation. On top of that, his payment history is riddled with partial payments to the point where he doesn't even know how far he is behind. We end up literally having to go over every payment he's submitted in the past 12 months with a calculator, so it takes another 10 minutes just to agree on the amount he owes. I can hardly get a sentence out before being interrupted (being interrupted was one of the most frustrating parts of my job as a whole I think, not just a problem with this guy). It's clear this guy needs mortgage assistance or he'll never be caught up, and probably lose his home*. In my head I groan, this means a discussion on what plans are available and filling out a worksheet with more of his financial stuff. I offer to update his information and start the review and get “FINE, but only to show you what a WASTE of TIME this is!”. Normally this process only takes about 20 minutes, but seeing as how this guy has argued about every nugget of information I estimate it will take about an hour. Of course I have to explain why we need this and that (income, expenses, etc.) for every item. Finally we get to the end and he is within the range to be considered for the Home Affordable Modification Project (HAMP). I explain that I can assign a specialist to his account, who he will be able to contact directly at their extension to continue the review and they'll explain which documents he needs to mail in. Immediately I hear the tone shift in his voice:

“Wh-What?”

I patiently reiterate.

“WHY DID NOBODY EVER EXPLAIN THIS TO ME BEFORE? NOW MY CREDIT IS RUINED AND rage rage rage..” 

“Sir our agents are required to offer to start this review to any borrower more than a month past due, many times we offer even if they aren't” 

“YEAH BUT NO ONE EVER TOLD ME THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY HELP ME”

… Wut? Best I can reply come up with is: 

“Well we don't know what options are available until after we update your information, if you never afforded us the chance to update that before today we wouldn't be able to tell you what was available.” 

At this point I just desperately want to get this guy off of my phone and transfer him to his assigned specialist. After several accusations of “YOU SHADY FUCKS ARE HIDING THESE PROGRAMS FROM US BECAUSE YOU JUST WANT TO TAKE OUR HOMES” and other pleasantries I'm finally able to connect him with the specialist and send him on his way, now that guy will have the specialist's direct extension number and will be his problem to deal with. 

And that, ladies and gentlemen is why I quit before being promoted to a Home Preservation Specialist. 

*Side note: Even when faced with abusive people I always try and figure out what I can do for them (not much, as a lowly collections agent). Working in a home mortgage call center during the housing crisis really gave me a good perspective on the entire situation, let's just say I will be renting my living quarters for many years to come. I even downloaded a few internal documents from our server to use as sources for a research paper on the market collapse I wrote for school (never got caught, and I don't even work there anymore so fuck it).",,False,self,t5_2urem,False,,,True,t3_yc807,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/yc807/yes_us_lowly_call_center_team_members_want/,

So here's one of mine.

So the call center I work for is an all-purpose answering service.  We answer everything from doctors and lawyers to tech support and emergency assistance.  There's few things we don't handle.  Jack-of-all-calls, master of none, I guess.  One of our larger accounts involves taking orders and/or messages for a clothing company which shall remain nameless, save for that it caters to rich white people (and I mean like multiple homes and multiple yachts for each one rich).  So obviously many of the people we talk to are rather entitled folk not used to not getting things their way and most definitely not used to being told ""no"".  Most are fine, some are even pleasant, but there are always the others...The people we talk to are usually older people unable to wrap their minds around the newfangled contraptions or, my personal favorite, people who don't trust putting their credit card info onto a website.  I get perverse joy from these especially because we take their orders and submit their CC info on literally the exact same website.  We do not have a special system, we pull up the company's site and place an order, just like anyone else could do from home.  Makes me giggle.

So this past holiday season said company had many (hideous) featured holiday items in their latest catalog.  Catalog time always means a ramp up in calls and, obviously, orders.  A ramp up in orders means sometimes things get sold out.  So I get a call one otherwise uneventful evening.

Me:  ""Good evening, thank you for calling (redacted), my name is TheCarpe, how can I help you?""

Customer:  ""Hello, I just received your catalog in the mail and I'd like to place an order.""

Me:  ""Certainly, what would like to order today?""

She gives me the item number of what she wants, a holiday-themed tie.  A few keystrokes later I am forced to tell this caller:

Me:  ""Oh, I do apologize ma'am, it appears we've sold out of that item.  We can continue the order if there was something else you liked, or I can leave a message for our main office who can let you know when the tie is back in stock?""

Customer:  ""...sold out?""

Me:  ""Yes, ma'am.""

Customer:  ""...but I just got the catalog in the mail today, how can you be sold out?""

Me:  ""Er, well again I do apologize, ma'am, this item has been very popular and unfortunately did sell out quickly.""

Customer:  ""But I JUST got this in the mail TODAY, you mean to tell me you've sold out of these in ONE DAY?""

Now obviously this was several months ago so I don't remember the exact exchange too well, but she was simply unable to wrap her mind around the idea that things have been sale before her catalog came in the mail, she screamed about why they wouldn't make more if they knew it was going to be popular (because they foresaw this in the stars, apparently) and demanded I have someone from the office call her because ""they have to have one somewhere and I am going to have it.""

So, in this woman's world, the items for sale in her catalog don't become available until she cracks it open for the first time.  All of my why.

I work in a market research call centre conducting customer satisfaction surveys. We use a satisfaction scale that we have to strictly stick to, this is:

Extremely satisfied, very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied, not satisfied at all.

Anyway, after explaining the scale to one particular gentleman, I asked him the first question, to which he replied ""3"". I said ""Sorry sir, we don't use a numerical scale, the scale is......"" and explained the scale to him again. He replied that he prefers to use numerical scales and said ""Are you not clever enough to convert a number 3 to the other scale?"" I was furious, I wanted to yell at him ""Why can't you do it, are you not clever enough?!"". Anyway, as I wanted to keep my job, I replied ""Yes Sir, actually I am clever enough to do that, but I'm not allowed to, due to recording reasons."" He just replied ""Oh"" and made a comment about how stupid it is. These surveys are not optional, I wish people would just say if they didn't want to do it, instead of doing it and complaining to me!

Anyway, he finally decided to use the proper scale and onwards we went. I know it isn't much, he wasn't shouting or anything, but it really annoyed me how snobby and stuck up he was, implying that I was dumb, just because I worked in a call centre.

So our operation is pretty simple. People call, we get their account number, then they tell us what they want to bet. It can get a little complicated but for the sake of this tale we'll say its that easy.

When you bet on a race it is important to know two things. **First**, what are the odds on the horses. Most guys need this so they know what kind of payouts they can expect. A lot of them just play the odds and don't know anything about the horses. **Second**, you need to know what scratches there are (What horses are running). This changes because each race has a different number of horses and sometimes a horse is listed to run but gets scratched last minute. Seems simple right? Wrong. A lot of our callers are morons and they don't know this information. It's all available on TV/Internet if you just took some time to look at it. 

Our sole purpose is to get bets in. We don't have to tell people the odds, results, or payouts. We don't even handle the money. We just put bets in. 

We have all this information in front of us, but we don't have to give it to them. The reason for this is that we are a small operation, 6 people at a time MAX. So when things get busy (Right before a race) we try to get peoples bets in as fast as possible because things are time sensitive. Our policy to not give out information is created for these situations. If someone absolutely needs the information we have a line we can transfer them to, but that is just a single person who usually doesn't have to do this stuff.

When things are slow and I'm bored I will sometimes tell people what they are looking for. Actually, I always do it. I have never once transferred someone away. I prefer to kill people with kindness. Until today. 

I got a call from someone who made a complaint the week before. He made the complaint because I, graciously, gave him the info he was looking for and I ended up being wrong about it. He asked about scratches in an obscure race and I told him there was a horse running that actually wasn't. He later got a full refund for the bet because it wasn't running. No big deal right? Wrong. He was angry because he would have played a different horse. How much did this bet cost? $3. Three fucking dollars. So he bitched. We process millions a month, this guy is barely on our radar. 

Well today he called again and asked for the odds on some horses. It was inbetween races and quiet in the office. I said ""hold please, I'll get you to someone who can answer your questions."" This may seem lame, and maybe it is, but I felt amazing.

I work at a huge telecommunications company in Canada. Front line rep, I help people with billing stuff, ordering products (phone, internet, TV), blah blah.

So, this lady calls in, specifically asking to speak to our Loyalty department. Big red flag... they do cancellations, among other things, and they're our please-don't-leave-our-company department, with access to special discounts and stuff.

I pull up her account and ask her about why she wants to speak to them, wondering if maybe there's an ongoing issue that they're addressing. And here's what she freaking says...

""I'm just calling in to extend the promotion they gave me. It's really an inconvenience that I have to call in every 6 months, but whatever.""

She threatens to leave us for our competitor, knowing it's a pot-sweetener phrase, *every six months* like clockwork, and she's complaining about the inconvenience of doing so? The tone of her voice, like *we were at fault* for making her call us to intentionally scam us?

And all for what? She's never so much as had an outage! We've never goofed on this account, she's had perfect service! Not so much as a delayed bill!

No, it's because she's so special, obviously.

I was livid. I could never work in Loyalty. I'd want to murder half my customers. Asking for discounts is normal enough, but *complaining about having to call back for discounts* is over the top ridiculous.

So, rather than transferring her over to the bunch of pansies in that department, I calmly and sweetly explained that this discount is not meant to be ongoing. That yes, our new customer discounts are great, but they're just meant to get people to try our services in the first place, on the expectation that once they've tried us out, they'll see how great those services are, and will gladly pay the standard pricing for those excellent services. I even told her something they'd mentioned in training, that it takes something like 6-7 months to even begin to turn profits on customers, because we go so over the top with new customer promotions. I explained that, as a result, if we tried to maintain that sort of pricing, we'd flat out go under. That our pricing is fair, and if you compare us apples-to-apples with our main competitor, we're actually less expensive.

So then she says, in a scathing tone, ""Oh wow, thank you so very much for a lecture on morality.""

And my first thought is... what, isn't it freaking obvious that this is a morality issue? You're intentionally pressing our buttons to try to scam our loyalty department into $20 a month discounts! Forever! *And* you have the nerve to complain to me about it!

I tried to talk her down gently, and she did end up getting off the phone in a huffy tone. I really hope she doesn't get contacted for a survey... I've got a nearly flawless customer satisfaction record, but somehow I doubt she'd rate me well.

Also, ten-to-one odds if I look at this account in ten minutes, she'll have been talking to Loyalty and will have gotten those damned discounts...",,False,self,t5_2urem,False,,,True,t3_13ihcd,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/13ihcd/i_hate_special_snowflakes/,

You might have heard of it, we're a bit of a big thing.  Anyway, customer calls in on Saturday.  Made his reservation on Wednesday for the largest size truck we had at one location near his house.  He's only moving across town, not across the country.  Unfortunately this being the last weekend of the month, let's just say he wasn't exactly the first person in the area who needed a rental truck.

Now a few things to keep in mind...  This truck wasn't at the location he had requested at.  In fact, we were currently overbooked for this particularly sized truck for the weekend in question.  The location he made the reservation wasn't an actual company owned/operated center, but rather a local dealer that let's just say was probably more worried about getting their commission on the rental rather than making sure the customer got the right information - namely that with little notice, he's going to have to travel and that size truck is in limited supply.

So Fun Customer calls in, nice at first.

FC: Hi, my name is FC, and I had a question about my reservation...

Me: Okay, what's your reservation number?  &lt;look it up, see what's going on, know he won't be thrilled&gt; Alright, I see you had a reservation for a very large truck.  Unfortunately with the limited amount of lead time and how busy this weekend is, the largest truck...
FC: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?  I HAD A RESERVATION!

Me: Which your confirmation clearly states that it is subject to equipment availability

FC: WHY WOULD I READ MY EMAIL?

Me: *facepalm* Sir, I understand that this isn't the most ideal situation, however with the availability of equipment in the area, this is the best option we can offer right now.  They've added additional miles so you're covered if you need to make another trip, and I'm showing that there's trailers available that can help you accommodate the size difference.  If I had a truck of that size to give you, I would.  But I can't build a truck for you.  We've offered you options that will let you finish your move, 

FC: I don't care.  I'm not doing two trips, I'm not towing a trailer.  I don't care if you have to bump another customer... &lt;my willingness to help him dies here.  don't ask us to unschedule someone who made their reservation well before you because you failed to plan&gt;

Me: Sir, I won't bump another customer to accommodate you.  It sounds as if there's nothing we're able to do to assist you, would you like us to cancel your reservation?

FC: No, don't cancel my reservation.  I want to speak to your supervisor, they can get me a truck.

Me: Okay, hold on, let me see if she's available.  &lt;I let her know what's up, she's in the middle of trying to find trucks for the roughly 100 or so people who decided to wait until that day to make reservations and as such is more than a bit busy.&gt;  Okay sir, she's actually assisting someone right now.  I'm not sure how long she'll be.  I'll let her know what the situation is, and she'll be back in touch.
FC: No, I'll hold.

Me: Sir, we only have a certain number of incoming lines and with the amount of incoming calls we're currently getting, we can't keep them tied up.

FC: I'll hold.

Me: That isn't possible.  I'll have her call you on 1234 number, can you be reached there?

FC (realizing he's been defeated): No, call me on 5678.  If I don't hear back, I'm going to call every hour until you get me that truck.

And lord did he.  Quite literally every hour on the hour, he called, all the way thru 9 that night.  And then starting Sunday morning.  Scheduling manager had been told what was going on, and said to everyone quite bluntly that there wasn't anything available, and that's what he was getting.  Two days later he decided to cancel his reservation.

We get all sorts of chats and all sorts of interesting and ridiculous people. Here's something awesome that happened the other day.

So I get a chat from this guy, and he's absolutely livid. Apparently he called one of our stores and asked if they could help him with his car. Well, the employee informs the guy that their store can't do anything about it, but he can find a store that will do it. So he puts the guy on hold.

As the customer paints it to me 3 hours pass, no doubt 3 minutes, and the guy hasn't come back and has ""blown him off."" (I mean really? If he wanted to blow you off he could have just said, ""Our store doesn't do that, bye."") And he's ranting at me about how horrible that was and how he's going to tell all his friends, family, neighbors, the president, his dog, his wife, the local paper, and the pope how awful we are.

I roll my eyes and imagine my, ""Oh poor baby."" voice as I type out how unprofessional and rude that was and how that store associate totally was an asswipe. (not exact words) Yeah, I'm throwing the dude on the fire, but I have a fucking survey score average to meet, so I suck his entitlement stiffy.

Alas no further developments, but this is still the funniest thing that has happened at work recently.

So in our call centre we deal with inbound calls from our clients. These clients are energy companies, they have onshore call centres in the UK (Where we are also located) and offshore call centres in South Africa and India. The offshore guys can be pretty entertaining as their first language is not English so sometimes they can get confused/muddled up with what they are trying to say. In this instance however, language and distance were not a barrier.

On to the story:

My female colleague is what you would call ditzy she says stupid things without thinking and leaves herself open for easy comebacks/jokes /puns. She is very friendly and this comes across in her calls. Through luck of the draw she ends up with the same offshore agent calling through five times in 10-15 minutes. He is so happy with her friendliness that he asks her to email him as she is so nice. Being the polite person she is, she emails him. A quick “hello I hope you are well, enjoy the rest of your day”. 


This should have been the end of that; however an unbreakable bond had been forged. At least in the eyes of our love struck offshore agent.

The two exchange a few emails back and forth:

Agent:  “I am good thank you, you have a nice name. Do you enjoy your work?”

Colleague: “Yes thanks I like both my name and work. Do you enjoy yours?”

Agent: “I do yes, but today I am sad, do you have a boyfriend?”

Colleague:  “why are you sad?”

Agent: “Is that question to personal for you?”

Now at this point those of us in the office that had been following the drama suggested that she stop responding as this was clearly going down the wrong road. However being the ditzy person she is, my colleague decides to email and ask one of her friends in our other office about what she should say? 
This was that email “hey what should I tell this guy he is a bit weird and is asking me if I have a boyfriend.”

As you all know in a call centre you are on and off calls so regularly an email that takes 20 seconds to write and send uninterrupted will take 10 minutes to take between calls. While composing the email she copied all the above correspondence with the agent to send to her friend. 

Or she thought she did. 

What she actually did was reply to the agent and not to her friend. She realised her mistake when the agent emailed her back “noted” followed 20 minutes later by “I have noted you do not like personal questions”

My colleague has freaked out at this point thinking she will loose her job or something and we are all joking with her asking when she is getting hitched, what date she is moving down to be with him all that jazz. Whilst not the funniest thing to of happened in the world it was the most entertaining in our office as our colleague is now scared every time she gets a call that it will be her distant admirer

I dropped out of the queue and started hunting for the source of the sound. A few rows over I found an older lady asleep on her keyboard. Her head was pressing in some of the keys and the computer was not happy. 

When I looked down at her phone I was shocked to see that she had a call on hold!  Not wanting to embarrass her (there were no other reps around) I went to the backside of her cube and gently kicked the divider.

I am grateful to have my job. I get benefits &amp; decent pay. Some of the callers, however, are the rudest most butthurt asshatted by-blows I've ever had the mighty displeasure of speaking with in my life. For example: tonight I received a call, which I knew right away was going to be bad. This jerk, who I""ll just call Jerk, opened the call by yelling over me as I said my opening. Something about a pay per view movie, and his food being cold. I let him rant a while, then when he paused to take a breath, I asked for the address on the account (we are required to verify the account by address or phone number). Boy, was that a mistake! I was then berated for 5 minutes-Why do I need to ask for his address, isn't it on my screen? He's had to wait 20 minutes on hold, he has a house full of dinner guests and now his food is cold. My company sucks, I suck.He said that I told him all he had to do was order the pay per view on his computer, and it would go through with no problems, etc. etc. etc. Which I did not tell him any such thing, he must have been referring to the previous rep he spoke with, whose call with him mysteriously got disconnected.

About this time I'm wondering why I even showed up at work today. I'm usually very patient, even when being talked junk to by a customer, but something about Jerk just really ticked me off. Perhaps it was the whiney-ness of his voice, or the fact that he kept saying ""I"" had told him all these things, when it was a different rep he had spoken with before. Surely he didn't think I was just sitting there in the office of a major cable tv company by myself, answering calls! Anyhow, I did my best to troubleshoot the issue. I apologized for his inconvenience, to which he said he did NOT want to hear any apology from me, he just wanted me to do my job and fix his movie. I deleted the pay per view movie that Jerk ordered and I went into the system and ordered it for him myself. I then told him to look on his screen to see if it had appeared, and (of course) it had not. Well, that made him even angrier at me. Now he asks me if this was the first time I've ever done this job, was this my first 'rodeo' (his words not mine), and did I even know what I was doing. 

I'm sure by this point it was hard not to hear the disdain in my voice, even though I tried to keep it out. So I decide to pull up my database, with the step by step troubleshooting instructions for his issue, and go through them one by one, by the book, no matter how long it took. He deserves the very best, right? I begin troubleshooting, and the more involved in the process he had to be, the angrier he got. When I asked him to reset his cable box, he lost it. He said he wanted to speak with my manager. I said of course sir I will be happy to get my manager, may I please tell her why you want to speak with her? So jerk proceeds to tell me how he wants to tell my manager that I don't know what I'm doing, that I am not showing any remorse or caring for his problem, and that he has been on the phone for 45 minutes now for a simple problem whilst his dinner grows colder and colder and his wonderful guests wait for him to start ______ (insert stupid jerky movie that is really dumb and why is a man even wanting to watch this anyway, it's a chick flick). So now he's not only wanting a sup call, he's wanting to try and get ME in trouble too. 

Well, I almost lost my cool. I said Sir, I did apologize for your inconvenience, but you told me you did not want my apology remember? Furthermore you started off the call by---this is as far as I got, because he started screaming at me! ""Don't you tell ME how to start MY phone call! I've had to walk YOU through these steps, you don't know what you are doing blah blah blah rant rant rant. At this point I got really quiet and just let him rant on while I waited for his cable box to finish resetting. He finally shut up and I asked him what was showing on his screen. He said his tv channels were back, so I once again went in and ordered the movie for him using my system. It still did not show up on his screen as it was supposed to. He gets all whiney again and asks for my manager, so I ask his permission to place him on hold (policy again) and begin typing up my escalation request. 

30 seconds go by with me typing and worrying that I may get in trouble this time for daring to speak up for myself in the small way that I did, when I notice my line has gone dead. He hung up after 30 seconds on hold! Our limit is 2 minutes, after that we have to click back over &amp; let the customer know why they are still on hold and ask permission to have them hold further. So either a-the movie finally came on for him and he hung up, or b-he gave up, or c-he realized what a jerk he was being and didn't want to be embarrassed when they listened to the call if it was escalated. Either way, I am surely glad Jerk hung up! I hope his food went down good cold! I hope it was something that sucks ass reheated like tacos or fried chicken! I hope it gives him the screaming 
demon shits! Ok I'm done.

    TL/DR: Customer berates CSR, then asks for a sup but hangs up after 30 seconds on hold for sup.

Every time I tried to talk she would raise her voice and speak over me.

The reason she had called was because there was a fraudulent charge on her debit card for $2.40 from 12/24. As I start to explain that I could cancel her card and send her a new one, she again raised her voice to speak over me. She would rant and during her pauses I would try to inform her on what was going on, but as soon as she heard any noise on my end she would just talk over me.

Rinse and repeat for about 10 minutes.

Eventually, she says ""I've been on the phone with you for 10 minutes and nothing's gotten accomplished"".

So I reply with ""Well ma'am, you keep talking over me and interrupting me. I can't tell you what I can do for you because you won't let me speak and anything I do tell you isn't what you want to hear so you just raise your voice. I can't help you if you won't allow me to help you. What you want me to do is impossible. We can not run a fraud charge as a dispute because whoever made that charge has your card information and therefore the card must be canceled and new one sent to you, which I can have expressed mailed to you at no charge. It may only be $2.40 now, but a month from now it could be $600.""

Apparently this is something else she didn't want to hear which caused her to rant on about how having her card cancelled would cause all her bills to be late yada yada yada rant rant rant.

I offered to transfer her to debit card dispute to see if they would be willing to process it as a dispute (I knew they wouldn't, VIsa won't allow us to), but that wasn't even good enough for her. She wanted to be transferred to a supervisor then demanded my name, which I gave willingly and offered my employee ID, which seemed to have shocked her that I wasn't bothered by her tantrum. She even had the nerve to tell me she didn't want me to tell the supervisor what was going on because she didn't want me to tell MY version of it.

After that call I was shaking and red in the face from being so angry. I left a note detailing the entire exchange, and through doing so noticed that there were notes on her account from 2009 documenting her rudeness and verbal abuse of our employees, even branch employees, one of which stated that the member had told her ""I work for the US Postal Service and I can talk to you any way I want.""

I think sometimes people like her forget that I have literally ALL of her information. Address, phone numbers, email address, social security number, all account numbers, all debit and credit card numbers, codewords, all accounts associated with her account, any external checking accounts that she may have transferred to or from, first and last name, middle initial, and any and all billing information related to her accounts, including utilities/rent/mortagage. They play with fire every time they abuse a representative. I could easily fuck her credit up, but of course I must be too stupid to ever think of something like that.

Oh, and a quick google search of her name and address can get me even more information.

If this had been face to face, I probably would have tried to kill her.

1357302262.0,32,self.talesfromcallcenters,15y4er,Callers and their lack of trust in phone jockeys and the companies they work for piss me off.,35,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/15y4er/callers_and_their_lack_of_trust_in_phone_jockeys/,"I don't get most of our customers/clients/users. Perhaps some businesses are out to screw the customer over for money, but the tech/advisor on the phone certainly isn't - and I doubt most businesses are. The lack of trust in a phone jockey is not helping with solving your problem. 

Observe this customer: 

Me: ""Hello this is DerpPhone sales department, you are talking to Farewelltolurking, good afternoon!""

Caller (female, mid forties): ""I'd like to talk to a supervisor please.""

Now this call centre didn't do escalations. Supers didn't get on the phone and knew jack shit about the product and troubleshooting. So I rattle of my usual talk:

Me: ""What seems to nature of your problem Ma'am? I have all the training needed to help you and am more than willing.""

Caller: ""I ordered a phone yesterday and it hasn't arrived.""

DerpPhone could guarantee a delivery within 5-10 working days for all phones. Usually however, the order would be delivered much sooner, but that's what we could guarantee as to avoid disappointment on the customer's end. The advisor is obligated to inform the customer about the  time needed for delivery -- it's actually in the script.

Me: ""Well ma'am, we guarantee delivery within 5-10 working days, so that's why your phone hasn't arrived yet. Did you receive an order confirmation in your mail?""

Her: ""Yes, I did. Where's my phone?""

Me: ""Like I said, it will be delivered within 5-10 working days. But can you tell me your phone number, so I can take a look into your files? I can also look at your order and tell you when to expect it.""

Her: ""No, I want to speak to a supervisor. I don't trust you with my phone number.""

Me: ""Ma'am, I'm bound to a non-disclosure agreement. Your data is safe and entirely confidential with me.""

Her: ""I'd still like to speak to a supervisor please.""

Here's the kicker:

Her: ""I know it's not your fault, but I don't trust phone techs and I'd like to speak to a supervisor.""

Me: ""Ma'am, I can't help you if you do not allow me to help you.""

Here's a good one-liner to help you deal with customers who are eating up your call-time. It deals with needless banter over procedures in a finite way:

Me: ""It's procedure here at DerpPhone; we don't escalate calls, ma'am. So I can't get a supervisor on the phone. If you don't allow me to help you there's nothing I - or anyone else in this department by the way - can do to help you.""

After all this needless banter - caused by a lack of trust in the company and the tech - she finally relented and gave me her cell phone number. I looked up her files and within a minute I coud reassure her that her order was sent on its way that morning and that she would be receiving it within 48 hours. If she gave me her phone number in the first 20 seconds the call would've lasted perhaps 2 minutes -- good for me and good for the customer. I don't get people like this.

And btw: this is one caller who I could convince to 'surrender' her digits. There's others who would write official complaint letters about my 'unwillingness to help' and my 'lack of commercial attitude' (me? lmao).

Girl: ...Okay, well what are you going to do about it?

Me: Unfortunately, these are valid charges and I won't be able to remove them from your bill.

Girl: ...No. Okay. You know what? No. What the f___ are the numbers I was supposedly dialing?

Per company policy, we aren't allowed to give out that information and I relay that information to her. She asks what country was being called and I tell her that information is also classified, unless she relays it to me first, and she LIVID at this point, and I asked to put her on hold so I could ask my boss if there was anything we could do.

RAAAAAAAAAGE!,46,10,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/1jwy88/half_price_for_six_months_now_please_please/,"For some years I worked for an outsourcing company, and so I have a wide variety of callcentre jobs to call on when writing these tales from call centres.  

This one was from a very well known company that provides satellite television to millions of subscribers.  I had been there a while, the training was good and I was confident and competent, working on the billing/ minor tech side of things.  11 second after call time, slightly high average talk time, amazing customer satisfaction scores (departmental record of three months 100% satisfaction/resolution scores).

It couldn't last.  The customers, they do not allow it.  

This subscriber, I will call him Thickhead, for that is what he was and probably still is, was stubborn.  I answered the phone and he was immediately not happy.  That sinking feeling when the smile becomes fake, you all know it.

Thickhead had been given six months half price television because he had not been happy about something, and called billing because that had come to an end and he could not work out why he was being charged the normal rate again.  

I read the notes on his account and explained the reason his direct debit amount had changed, that it was not a mistake, but that I am sorry if when the offer was applied it was not explained to him that when it finished, the charge would go back to normal again (I wonder about these people, I really do).

How dare we charge him what we charge other people, the same amount he signed the contract for without notification?  

""I'm not happy, you can make me happy by giving me six months half price television subscription!""  Demanded Thickhead.

Me:""Sorry Sir, that offer is no longer available.  There are no offers currently available on your account as you enjoy the full package and so there are no introductory offers that would be appropriate and as you recently had a discount, I am not able to apply anything further. Perhaps if you contact us again in a few months time we could see what is available for you then, or I could make a reminder for myself and call you back when other offers are available?""

Nope.  

Thickhead:""You are not being helpful!  I am not happy and you are not making me happy, why are you not helping me?! (whining tone creeps in)  I know you can give me half price, you have done it before!""

Me: ""I'm sorry Mr Thickhead, we do not have the six months half price offer available in this department.""

Thickhead:""But you do have it available.""

Me :""Not in this department.  The offer you enjoyed last time was given as a result of your dissatisfaction when you contacted our cancellation team.  (This had gone on for approaching 35 minutes by now and I was beginning to lose patience, so far I had towed the company line, now it was time to go for the big guns... honesty.)  In the billing department we have not been given the authority to apply such large discounts as we are not expected to have to win back people's good opinion.  I can put you through to the cancellation team if you like?

TH:""ARE YOU TRYING TO LOSE MY CUSTOM?!""^yes

Me:""Not at all Sir, I am explaining to you the limitations of what this team is able to authorise, and what the rules are for each team within our Customer Services Group.""  

Anyway, Thickhead was too thickheaded to get the hint that no one was going to give him a whole years worth of half price tv just because he was whining, or to see that there is no business sense in doing that, or that threats of going on Watchdog were going to have no effect, or that even if I was suggesting I put him through to the cancellations team they *just might* be able to get him what he wanted, but probably not.

I got rid of him eventually after nearly an hour by giving him £20 and telling him that an offer he previously had looked not to have applied to his bill.  I looked closer later and found that the £20 had come off another bill, but by then I was too knackered and wanted rid of him that I wasn't exactly at my best.

He left appaling feedback for me, saying what a useless robotic person I was, that I personally would lose the company hundreds of customers.  All the team leaders who knew me listened in to the call, because the feedback was so bad they were expecting something entertaining.  They didn't get much.  Apologies for length.

I work for a mid-sized company with less than 100 employees that's growing rapidly. We're taking on larger accounts every day, and my company makes probably millions of dollars a year on single accounts. Problem is, the structure of the company is terrible; We have no full-time trainer, we hire complete idiots (some of which can't even spell properly) and the pay is complete shite compared to the rest of the industry. We have ONE Account Support Representative (and THOUSANDS of accounts, gigantic and small) and half of the time we're not trained on new accounts. 

That being said, most accounts we take in are simple, but some are downright fucking batshit insane - ridiculously complicated scheduling calendars, no constant contact with business owners, and some businesses don't even have valid mailing addresses.

Needless to say, we answer for a lot of really fucked up businesses that make it their job to screw over helpless, stupid SAPS that will believe whatever claims a TV infomercial can cram into the gooey grey matter they call a ""brain"".

And this website is one of them.

The man that owns the business owns maybe 8 other ""Natural Enhancement"" product websites, and all of them are bogus weight-loss BS - the type that quacks like Dr. Oz reccommend. The other accounts get calls from irate customers calling in about not having received a refund, even though their product was sent back months ago.

But I can tell this particular account is going to be the worst of them all. It started today with NO WARNING to employees, and as soon as the account was set up we were fucking LIVE, baby!

The website claims:

**""EXPLODE YOUR LOAD FOR THE BIGGEST ORGASM YOU'VE EVER HAD!""**

&gt; *""Are you interested in a product that can increase your load? You can – with (redacted) – the supplement that will have you shooting the biggest, most powerful load ever – while remaining rock-hard for hours and enjoying orgasms like you never have before!""*

Pity me please, for it seems I have nothing better to do with my life than answer calls for barely above minimum wage and discuss people's jizz.

My first call was from a man we'll call ""Jimbo"". This is how the first exchange goes:

*Me: ""Thank you for calling (super semen supplement) - my name is (redacted) how may I assist you today?""

*Jimbo: ""Well if your website is to be believed, you can help me fill my woman to the brim!""

And the calls got worse from there; callers of which I can only imagine as balding, sweaty fat-fucks regaling us of tales of how they can't produce a teaspoon of fuckbutter, calling every five goddamn minutes. Soon, the lines between reality and fiction began to blur heavily, and I could no longer tell which calls were pranks and which ones were serious.

I had one man ask if we sold buckets. **BUCKETS.** He dead-panned it so well I think he was serious, and that scared the fuck out of me. Another asked if he could take the pills even though his wife was pregnant.

*Me: ""I don't think your wife being pregnant has any bearing on you taking the pills, sir...""

*Jackass: ""Well sure it does! If my spunk load is increased and gets thicker, then what if I shoot her up so hard it breaks her water?""

Yes, he actually said *""spunk load""*. **I CAN'T MAKE THIS SHIT UP.**

Worst of all, is that we don't have a mute function on our headsets, so we have no way of masking the uncontrolled reactions.

So thanks to a recent post about permission to [troll prank callers](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/1i7bwf/i_have_been_given_explicit_permission_from_my/) I was convinced to tell this story:

I work in a tech support call center. Sometimes we get prank calls. There was this one guy calling in over and over, same story. It was impossible to hear him well enough to get his account information to ever start troubleshooting anything. When we finally drag something out of him, it's an unregistered domain name, or an IP address with too many numbers... Call centers, and tech support, can be stressful, so some of the technicians were understandably not amused by this joker. So I told a few of my coworkers to just transfer the call to me. Soon, I got the following:

**coworker in chat**: Hey, jaggeddragon! I just realized I've been wasting the last half hour of my life talking to that guy that doesn't even have a computer again.

**jaggeddragon**: You sure?

**coworker in chat**: yeah, at first I thought it was a bad connection, but I'm sure he's no customer of ours after this long

So he sends me the call. I'll give you the gist of it:

""Hello! This is jaggeddragon from [Where I Work]. I understand there's been some confusion during your call and I've been contacted to help. What seems to be the trouble?""

*incomprehensible series of phone noises* I note that this is the unmistakable sound of someone eating chips while watching tv over speakerphone on a skype connection while downloading something. Which matches the incoming phone number (skype uses the same number for all skype calls in an area, so we can't just block the number).

""I'm sorry, I couldn't catch that... Could you repeat that?""

*same sounds as above, with a chuckle somewhere in the middle*

""Hmm... It sounds like I might be on speakerphone, I can't quite hear you. Do you happen to be using a Skype connection?""

*muffled ""Wha?"", then sounds of movement*

The Guy: ""Uh, is that better?""  I should note that the quality of the connection was not, but he was clearer because he was closer to the mic.

Me: ""A bit, may I have your account information?""

*More muffled sounds* He's gone back to the chips... and I guess he unpaused his Netflix, because that noise came back, and the quality dropped again.

I'm not an asshole and am actually pretty good at what I do. But I should not be working in a call center. I'm a peacock and I need to fly. 

Moving forward. My story. 

I prepare auto loans for people. I speak to them prior to their actual signing of the paperwork. 

Last week I'm orchestrating a private party sale between a mother and son. The son is *selling* his vehicle to his mother. I receive the call and the lady is elderly, and she passes security and wants her son to speak on her behalf. So the seller is the buyer in this situation. 

I ask to the son how much he is selling the vehicle to his mother for. **""$15k""** 

**""OK Sir but the loan was originally requested for $20k the cars not being sold for $20k?""** (we need this for tax purposes)

**""Well $15k is the max amount that was approved so that's the selling price.""**

It's now evident to me that the *seller/son* is taking a loan out with his mom's credit on his free and clear vehicle. 

Unethical and likely elderly abuse if you ask me. Even if mom agreed to it. I asked all the standard questions. *Who is driving the car? Who is to be paying for it?* And the right answers are given. I'm trying to kill this cause I don't like it. 

I escalate this to my managers and we really can't stop this from happening. Red flags went up when the application was initially reviewed and we put the mother through extra security to see if this is really what she wants to do. 

This isn't the first time I've encountered this kind of situation and it goes against my ethics but I have a job to do. I don't think I'd have qualms about this had the son not played buyer and seller in this transaction but he did. But who knows maybe he just has a really nice mom.",,False,self,t5_2urem,1368210103.0,,,True,t3_1e2z97,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/1e2z97/sometimes_you_have_to_go_against_your_ethics/,

Lately, there's been a couple of projects that I've just found nearly impossible to generate much interest on. It's pissing me off, and making me feel all disappoint, so I need to vent for a bit...

The reasons are simple. First, the economy sucks, and a lot of companies just simply aren't spending money right now. 

Secondly, it seems that a lot of the lists that I get from my company to dial from are old, and/or inaccurate. That means that more often than not, the person we have listed doesn't work there anymore/never has worked there, or is entirely the wrong person to talk to. It's unbelievable the amount of time wasted getting bounced around, calling the wrong people, etc. 

And third, there's this little thing called VM. It's pretty much a given, at least from where I sit, that if my calls get screened, that I will be going to VM. Some days, all I get is operators sending me to various VMs, over and over again, for hours on end. 

The worst part is when I submit my work at the end of the shift, and the boss says, ""Oh, it doesn't look like you reached very many contacts today..."" Well, I reached lots of people, but un-fucking-fortunately, they're all operators and receptionists, and *not* the person I actually need to talk to. It's pretty fucking hard to try to sell something to the recording on someone's VM, don't you think?? I mean, I can't *force* people to answer the phone. That's out of my hands, and well beyond my control. I just don't like being made to feel like I'm not doing my job because I haven't been able to astrally project myself into someone's office, out in West Bumblefuck, Iowa, and whack them in the head with a small bat until they reach over and answer their phone. 

Or worse than that, I ask to talk to one person, and then my call is transferred to some fucking body else, who has no idea why the fuck I'm calling them, or I get sent somewhere where they can't help me at all. GAH!!!

Know what's even more fun? When I actually reach a person, and they say they're not interested. That's cool, because I just tick the box off, and move on. Flash forward a few days, I notice they're on my list again, for the same project. Like they've changed their mind in a couple of fucking days??!? All I'll accomplish by bothering them again is to piss them off, and pissed off people don't buy shit! 

Oh, and that's another thing I get too. ""Oh, you have to push..."" And just exactly *how* the fuck am I supposed to do that?? Somewhere between the VM recording and the beep, or if I actually get the person on the phone, somewhere between the ""Sorry, I'm not interested."" and the *click*?? 

Sorry about the wall of text, and the vent, but I just had to get this off my chest. I feel a little better now.

Customers would always call in and demand that the fee be waived but I got this one asshole that had like 5 iPhones and apparently was god. He threatened to go to Verizon and I said ok so that will be $1625 in early termination fees since he just upgraded and when you go to Verizon it will be a 35 dollar activation fee per phone. He argued that they don't have fees which I know is a lie because I have Verizon and will never have AT&amp;T.

Six weeks of classroom instruction (i.e. ""paid vacation"" for all the good it did), one week of OTJ (I'll have a story about that another time), and you were thrown to the wolves.  

One of the things I got really good at was guessing how the call was going to go before the pre-recorded greeting ever finished. Before I even realized it, I was stereotyping people without even realizing it. I felt bad about it, and made a concerted effort to NOT do it as much. However, this one call hit me square in the back of the head (Agent Gibbs Style) with the knowledge that sometimes, stereotypes exist for a reason.  

****BEEP****  

    [Computer]
    ""West Region""  

    [Pre-Recorded Greeting]
    ""Thank you for calling [Name Of Carrier]. My name is ReferenceEdit.
     May I have your first and last name, please?""  

As the greeting is playing down the line, the account pops up on the screen. I notice immediately that the account is registered in none other than Compton. ""Here we go...this is gonna be good,"" I think shamefully to myself. The greeting finishes and the customer comes on the line.  

**CUSTOMER**  

    ""Why da hell mah bill so high?!?!?!?!""  

**ME**  

    ""Ma'am, I would be happy to assist you with any questions you may
     have regarding the amount due on your bill, but I need your first
     and last name to verify that I have the correct account on my
     screen.""  

She grudgingly provides the information, I go through the account verification procedure, determine that she is indeed the account holder, and restate her problem (per the annoying script). I take a look at her most recent bill, and the entire time she keeps rambling on about how ""this damn company tryin' ta rob people &amp; shit"" and ""I ain't never had a bill that's been right. Y'all tryin to get me to pay like three times what my plan says I supposta pay"".  

Based upon the interaction so far, I had a hunch as to why the bill was as high as it was. I look at the payment history to confirm, and sure enough it's about three months behind and about to go into collections. What's more, the account is barely six months old, and the first payment is the ONLY one that's ever been on time. I can already see where this is going...  

I come back to the customer and explain that the amount due is from being delinquent in payments. In that case, the unpaid amount is automatically added to the bill on the next cycle. I then inform her that if the amount due is not paid, her account will be suspended and placed with collections. She was angry and belligerent to begin with, but now she completely flips her shit. I begin to get called every name in the book, accused of trying to rob her, and she screams at me that it's ""bullshit, 'cuz nobody done told me 'bout nothin like that!"" She then wants to know if she can pay the current bill and have the past due amount be paid off later.   

I politely explain to her that the consequences for non-payment were indeed spelled out in the contract she signed in good faith. I also let her know that, while I can understand the shock of such a high bill, there is nothing I can do, especially on a new account without a lot of payment history.  

Inside, my dark side is screaming ""What the hell did you think was going to happen if you didn't pay, lady?? You want to call and bitch at me for ten minutes because you don't pay your bills, and act like it's MY fault??? Now you want me to ""do something about it for you""? Even if there WAS a way, it would require a long-term account in good standing. There's no way your six month old account that's never been paid on time would qualify! And if by some miracle it DID, there's no way in hell I'd help you out after you've been a total bitch from the moment you came on the line!""  

But I kept calm and annoyingly polite. I told her that, unfortunately, there was nothing I could do for her, and the only option was to pay the full amount due. I offered to take the payment over the phone, but stated she could also go to her local retail store and pay there, even going so far as to look up the one closest to her.  

Nope. I just get screamed at for a bit more before she hangs up on me. Luckily it was a slow day, so I still had time to finish notating the account.  

    CCI extremely irate/belligerent over amnt due on current bill.
    explained to cust. reason for current charges, offered to take
    pmt via phone. cust. refused explanation and released call
    before any pmt info rec'd.

    acct pmt hist shows no on-time pmt beyond initial bill cyc.
    cust. is not entitled to any credits/discounts/waivers due
    to poor pmt hist and low age of acct

Or something to that effect. The sad thing is, the entire time I was filling out the notes, I realized not only was I completely unsurprised by what had transpired, but that I was again stereotyping customers after trying so hard not to. This, combined with many other instances of irate customers and poor floor management, began letting me see that this job was fast turning me into a vile, bitter, miserable person.

I used to work for a government information line as one of a few call centres I have worked in.

Surprisingly it was a pretty bloody good place to work.  Inbound calls only, in between calls we could do nearly anything we wanted (games of Civilization used to happen, I became well versed in many an on-line comic, many books were read).  This is the only place I have worked that I got in trouble for not taking enough breaks.  True story   

I will try to piece together some stories from his job, as it was a government info line, we had some shall we say interesting people call in with some interesting ideas.

To completely change the tone of what I'm expecting these stories to be like, I'll start out with a rather nice lady.

She had divorced her husband many, many years prior, and from what she said he was an abusive arsehole. She took over as power of attorney, as he was beginning to lose his mind, and literally no one else would help.  This guy was into his sixties, and had NO ONE except his ex-wife that would step in and help him.

She was panicked because she had received a bill for his care.  Now, the care he was receiving was heavily subsidised by the government, so he shouldn't have to pay what he couldn't afford.  It was several hundred dollars, but this was several hundred dollars this woman simply didn't have.

I explained that the bill was in his name, his income should be able to afford it, and she was liable to pay exactly $0.

Several minutes were spent on the phone explaining the policy in great detail and at the end of the call she went from on the verge of tears to happy and gushing about what a great job I was doing.

I was wrapping up the call, when she asked me:

&gt;Um... this may sound like a strange question, but are you married.

I'm not adverse to some cougar lovin', but this lady was a little out of my desired age bracket.  Anyone that can remember the moon landing is probably a little old.  Anyone that can remember taking time off work to watch the moon landing is definitely too old.

I said I had a girlfriend of several years.

&gt;Oh, 

quoth she

&gt;It's that my daughter had just come back into the country, and is desperately single at the moment.

Grea-a-a-at.  I guess I have to add 'being pimped out to persons unknown' to my job description now.

I don't know, though.  The daughter did own her own house in [Byron Bay](http://www.byron-bay.com/), could be a LOT worse.

I worked at a ski resort for a year, and we had our fair share of crazy callers, but *none* take the cake like this one did. 


The first mistake was running an ad in the paper in a very large nearby city advertising our hill. It didn't include any deals or anything, it was just an ad. One night, myself, another agent and our manager are manning the phones. It's pretty quiet. The phone rings, and the other agent (we'll call her Tina) pick up. Obviously I can't hear what's being said but I watch Tina's face during the 19 minute phone call turn from bewilderment, to amusement, to frustration, to exhaustion. 


Finally the caller hangs up and we eagerly play back the call. The gist of it went something like this - caller rings up and states that she's just seen our ad in the paper and that she's like to order a pizza. Tina tells her that this is a ski resort. Caller overly excitedly claims that her name also is Tina, and that she's broken her ankle in a hot tub. Tina sympathizes. Caller asks Tina if she's ever broken her ankle and then proceeds to lecture her on why hot tubs are dangerous. Out of no where, caller SHRIEKS into the phone, telling someone in the background to shut up. 


This goes on for, I kid you not, 15 minutes. Tina didn't even have to say anything, she just listened as the caller continued to berate whoever it was in the background and tell tales of pizza and hot tubs. We also clearly identified three changes in accent. Not 20 minutes after Tina hung up, I get a call asking for Tina. It's our favorite hot tubbing pizza eater again. Because it's slow and I am bored, I transfer her over and we sit through another 15 minute call. This time two of them have called in and they both take turns shrieking at each other (I think one was playing the part of ""mom"" and the other was the ""child"") while asking Tina about her family and private life, again while pretending to be British, or Mexican, or whatever. It was fairly amusing, but at one point Tina just sighed and hung up on them. 



**TLDR** Drunk/stoned caller calls in to a ski resort asking for pizza and changes her accent three times while shrieking into the phone.

It would be like me calling the police to report the car in front of me is stopped at a red light), yesterday was the cherry on top of the ""I'm suing you!"" sundae.

First, the call starts off with a retail agent calling in on behalf of a customer. The phone went bad after a few months and he got it replaced by the manufacturer... His issue is the replacement is a refurbished device. I just let the retail person know the replacement was through the manufacturer and if the customer wants to dispute it he needs to call the manufacturer directly (our policy). 

At this point the retail person says ""yeah, I'm not telling this guy that, but you can"" and hands the phone off.

After I get the guy on the phone, I repeat what the policy is and offer to get him the number to the manufacturer. Of course, he blows up. After some time he says ""If my transmission went out on a new car after 3 months, my 5 year warranty says I will get a whole new car, not a used one!!"" 

Me: Well, this isn't about a new car. It is about a phone and [manufacturer] has a warranty for 12 months, if it gets replaced it is a refurbished unit.

Cust: BULLSHIT!!! I AM SUING YOU GUYS!!

Me: so... You want to sue us because we won't honor your vehicle's warranty?

Cust: YES! I GET A 5 YEAR WARRANTY AND A NEW CAR, SO I EXPECT THE SAME FROM YOU.

Me: you are free to pursue any legal consult you feel neccessary. For your convenience, I can definitely speak back with the retail rep to have him print a copy of the documents you signed that outlined this warranty information so you will be prepared when you go see your lawyer.

Cust: why would I need that?! I will just go get my car's warranty info! *click*

As I explained in my previous post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/171m9g/nighttime_adventures/), I am a rep at a credit card processor who gets the privilege of being trained in several skillsets. The relevant skillset that will be discussed below is performing tech support for our company's supported credit card terminals, of the variety most commonly found at small businesses everywhere. 

This just happened to me a little while ago, and proves that even when people are listening, they aren't listening. The customer in this instance is called PaperMan, for reasons that will be obvious. 

*the usual beep of an incoming call in my ear*    
I go through the usual back and forth of my greeting, getting the account number, pulling up the account, vertifying the name, and the fun begins. 

Me: How may I assist you, sir?    
PaperMan: My receipts are printing out blank, and I believe that my machine is out of ink, but there was no on-screen warning.    
Me: Alright, what model of terminal do you have there?    
PaperMan: I have a Hypercom *newer model terminal*.    

Now, most up-to-date credit card terminal, even though they are relatively primitive compared to a PC, use a thermal printer, not an ink printer.

Me: Ok, sir, that model of terminal has a thermal printer in it, and doesn't use-    
At this point, he interrupts me before I could finish my sentence to hurriedly correct himself.    
PaperMan: Yeah, that's what I meant, the thermal print, it's not printing. Can you fix it?    

Yeah, i can fix it. That's sort of what I was about to do, genius.    

Me: Alright, this is caused by one of two things. Either you have the wrong paper, or it was loaded backwards. I need you take a piece of the paper that came out blank, and scratch it with a fingernail.    

Lots of rustling noises come through the phone, and after a minute or so he comes back on the phone sounding confused as to why I would make him do so.    

PaperMan: Ok, I scratched the paper.    
Me: Did it change colors and get dark?   
PaperMan: Uh, yeah. It changed colors where I scratched it.    
Me: Good, that means that you have the proper paper. If you could, please open the printer door, reverse the paper roll, and close it again.    
PaperMan: Oh. I guess my new trainee must have put the paper in backwards.    
Me: Once you have the paper loaded again, reprint a recipt on the machine.    

Once again I hear lots of noises, and then I hear the printer whine out a receipt. Triumphantly, the PaperMan returns to me.    

PaperMan: Ah-ha! It's printing everything now.    
Me: Then your terminal should be all set to go.    
Paperman: Good. Before I go, i have just one more question. This thermal thing, if it runs low on ink, will there be a message on the screen?    
Me: ...no, there isn't going to be a message. This terminal does not use ink, there is a thermal printer.   
PaperMan: Ooooohhh, I see. I thought it used ink to print. Ok ,well thank you!

1) Shopping at the mall is a WANT not a NEED. 

2) I would have checked the balance first, before going to the mall.  So you being at the mall with an inactive gift card does not phase me.

3) Your gift card is only 30 dollars less than my paycheck.

4) I've heard it before, all those excuses your spouting off about not paying your bill? I have heard them, some I've gone through myself, it doesn't change what I can do.

5) I'm not making your brother feel like an ass because he got you the wrong $25 gift card.  I would have thanked my brother and stuck it somewhere, and not told him I couldn't use it.

6) Seriously, if you're trying to guilt trip me by turning me into the bitch, when its you, its not going to work.  I'm not the one keeping your husband out of the loop during a treatment, or ruining your families Christmas.

8) If you didn't actually purchase anything from us, just recieved a gift card... your threats over not using our company because we protect the purchaser's money by requiring information to activate the cards and another level to review our requests to activate the cards... well they fall flat.

9) Seriously, I've heard it all but I've also heard it from people who aren't expecting miracles.  These people have a tone of voice and its less of a guilt trip and more of a plea of 'Please help me in anyway you can.' Chances are even if I cant help them exactly in the way they need, but eventually fix their issue in some way (like a delay in activating a card, but starting the process, or just advising them when their scheduled suspension was planned and to push the time they could have an extension when to call back) would thank me.

Please bare with me as this is being typed on my phone. 

I work for a company that does outbound calling for colleges and universities to request donations for annual funds as well as reaching out to prospective students with surveys to peak interest for up coming fall semesters. 

This week I was calling surveys for a school, and part of the job is to reach out to the parents to complete the survey if the student is unavailable. This call was an experience I have not encountered in over 6 years of calling. 

The call started out like any other call. The student was away, so I asked the father if he could answer the questions on her behalf. Everything was going smoothly until he asked the dreaded question. ""Are you a student at the school, or are you a third party."" This question can go over smoothly or be like facing Goliath himself. I told him that I was a third party, which caused the unspeakable to happen. The guy started to ask questions about me and my life. Nothing overly person, just trying to learn about me as a person. 

A quick history about me. I am a graduate with a degree in electrical engineering and I have been out of school for about 2 years. I have had an extremely hard time to find a job in my field and it has been weighing heavily on me to the point of tears and depression. 

The father on the phone lived a town over from my school and turned out to have an older son who attended university during the same time period. We started discussing different student hangouts to see if I may have known him, but I didn't. The father went on to mention how his son is struggling to find a job as well, but he is proud of him for continuing to try. 

As I was trying to be sympathetic to his son and to him for being a cool guy and sharing his son's story, he did the last thing I would expect a stranger to do. He told me that he was proud of me for trying to find a job to. He said no matter what happens, trying is all you have and there is a lot of pride in just doing that.

Well boys and girls, it took every ounce of my manhood to choke back the tears that were welling up inside me like a flash flood. It took all my will power to make it through the rest of that call without crying. Even after the call, I needed a few moments to catch myself  before I could continue onto the next call. 

He doesn't know it, but that man truly restored faith in myself to continue trying through my struggles, and I just wish I could thank him for that.

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read. I greatly appreciate it and I hope people know the power of one kind gesture towards another.

Seven years I've worked a fantastic call center with truly excellent managers and quiet nights.  It's a damn good job.  There are plenty of perks and the pay is decent.  

Unfortunately, it has necessitated dealing with crazy people, now and then.  In the whole time I've been at this, none has been moreso than Jimmy.  

Poor Jimmy.  Sad, sad Jimmy.  

It began before I started working there.  Jimmy was a caller on a line for mental health patients needing to make or cancel appointments.  Nothing serious.  That was all the line handled.  

Jimmy was, in the classical sense, out of his friggin' gourd.  He'd been forbidden from calling this line and asking for various nurses, celebrities, chickens, and close relatives, but that didn't stop him.  I think he'd hike from wherever his little compound was up to the local gas station to place at least three calls a night.  Towards the beginning it was fine.  Nothing wild.  Just requests to speak to people who didn't exist.  

As the years went on and Jimmy's state slowly decayed, he got gradually more creative and frankly, nuttier.  Eventually it became some truly spectacular threats of violence.  Various operators started trading these back and forth, compiling a list of Jimmy's threats.  I'm just going to share mine.

1.I'm going to slice off your feet and make you walk a mile!

2.I'll boil your eyes in their sockets!

3.I'll fill your family with explosives, then when you hug them, they'll blow you apart!

4.I've got a razor-blade and I'm going to cast voodoo on you!  You'll die coughing razors! (I wonder if he saw this one in a movie?)

5.Your cars all have bombs inside them!  Now you're trapped forever, fuckers!  See how you like it!

6.Don't look under your desk.  I'm down there, waiting.  I'll cut your balls off!  (I'm female.) 

7.I let a bunch of African Walking spiders loose in your house.  They've got your children already.  And your dog. 

8.Where is your daughter?  I've got her in my vice!  I'm squeezing her head!

I said 'Just a moment, I'll calculate that for you' to which he replied something like 'Ha, You need a calculator for that?' (Umm, Yes, I do. You asked me to work out the maths which makes me think YOU didn't know the answer either)
From that point on, any time any number was mentioned (Example, a reference number) the customer talked to me in a *Hurr Durr* voice and said things like 'Oh, wait, let me get a calculator'

I quickly retorted 'Yeah, not people like you - She has taste' and hung up on the customer. I left shitloads of notes on his account so that he didn't get the fees waived next time based off him being a cunt.

When has a customer offended/insulted you?,30,4,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/1kaq25/its_happened_to_all_of_us_when_has_a_customer/,"So I'm entering my 9th year as a phone monkey and I have finally found myself offended by a client for the first (and second... and third...) times. So since my last question to everyone went over so well I figure I should ask a new one! 

Working in the industry, we tend to have thick skins, but what are the most memorible times (or only times) you have actually felt insulted (or offended) by a customer?

For me, I had the joy of speaking to this client not just once, but twice in the course of a week and before him, I didn't think there was anything a customer could say that would make me feel insulted, after all, they're just swearing at the company, not me right?

Memorible Quotes:

""I don't want to speak to some idiot that only makes $9 per hour!"" (When I told him he couldn't speak to the Vice President of the company, but my manager) This earned a ""Sir, that was uncalled for""

""I know my name is &lt;retracted&gt;, but I'm not Mexican, I'm not estupid! I'm Cuban! We're smart!""
(I am not Mexican/Hispanic, but really? I did not mention accent or his name once, he decided to insult an entire country/culture because instead of giving him exactly what he wanted, I was (trying) to comprimise)

""You don't know anything, you probably didn't even go to college! My son is a lawyer..."" 
Once again eared a ""sir that was uncalled for"". Doesn't matter if I went to college or not (I didn't), you are trying to condecsend and make me feel stupid/unimportant because I dare disagree with you? No thank you! Icing on the cake: Earlier in the same call he said he was a college drop out.

So I feel a little better getting that off my chest (yet again, I think half the call center has heard the story by now). What nightmare customers have you all had?

1361695251.0,26,self.talesfromcallcenters,194joq,"Frustrated with management's recent misuse and abuse of call metrics, among other things... (letting off some steam!)",29,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/194joq/frustrated_with_managements_recent_misuse_and/,"Hello, TFCC! Long-time reader/poster, first time submitter (and on an alternate account, to boot). First and foremost, I work in a technical call center environment full-time for just under $15/hr. We establish remote connections with our customers' computers to set up networks, remove viruses, and assist with general issues/concerns. I've worked at this job for six over months and would like to believe that I have a strong technical background. 

Management has recently been pushing metrics far more than normal. They used to be fairly lenient, but now it's all AHT, AHT, AHT. Our AHT goal used to be a palatable 28 minutes, but they've since rolled out some scripts and expect it to be down to - on average - 22 minutes. For calls that are nothing but networking, they expect 17.5 minutes.

This is where the problems come into play. This job is highly technical, and as such all of our callers are going to have unique problems. AHT could almost be determined at the roll of a die. Virus removals take around 45 to 60 minutes on average, customer interaction included. A person that gets several callers with infected systems is going to have a high weekly average and is going to be flagged for performance. This has been me for the last couple of weeks.

I have tried telling management (or at least the guys above me that I *can* speak to) that this isn't an acceptable measurement for the work involved. It's falling on deaf ears, and I've even been threatened with PIPs if I ""don't improve"".

This is where my frustration escalates. I didn't take this job to fluff metrics, I took it because I love technology and love assisting people. There are technicians that are constantly transferring calls under the guise that they can't help out, despite the fact that we're a *paid service*. I don't know how people can live with themselves; it basically feels like scamming people out of their hard-earned money at that point.

From what I've said thus far, I probably do sound like a poor performer; however, my customer satisfaction surveys and high success ratio says otherwise. My customer satisfaction is just under 100%. Most callers pass along my surveys with flying colors, and I rarely receive any complaints. In my several months here, I have only had to terminate one call due to the customer slinging personal insults at me. Almost everyone has been a pleasure to work with, or I've at least been able to deescalate them and take control of the call to resolve their problem. My most furious customers are usually singing praises before they hang up.

Don't even get me started on our sales agents. Our sales agents were ""recently"" outsourced, and they've been nothing but trouble. Customers are constantly complaining about their lack of professionalism, difficulty to understand, and misstatement of what services they are being sold. Had a customer yesterday that thought he was paying $14.95 to fix his email problem. Nope, he was paying $49.95. 

These sales agents have also caused major headaches for those of us delivering support. Non-paying customers are frequently transferred to us, they'll transfer customers our way in the middle of our greeting making us sound completely incompetent, and they will frequently sell the wrong type of service to resolve the issue the customer is calling in about. That basically leaves us - the engineers/experts - to often do the selling anyways. 

On top of the sales department outsourcing, the company has been cutting costs in several other areas. They've declared wage freezes for all employees, so the top performer gets paid as little as our bottom of the barrel techs (and trust me, our bottom of the barrel folks aren't too great). They have also posted a video from the CEO basically stating just how insignificant we truly are, and how despite the company now finally turning a profit they need to start slimming down. 

Morale is at an all-time low. Employees have been dropping like flies. I only have a few close friends anymore. All of the other highest-qualified technicians have either left, or are ranting about the recent stress from the position. 

I think that perhaps it's time for me to start packing my bags and calling it quits. Unfortunately, there aren't too many openings in this relatively small town, so I'd have to put in an ungodly amount of effort to find another competitive offer. As I stated earlier, however, I love(d) this job because I love solving problems, not fluffing metrics. I've had a burning passion to go into business on my own, and I believe it may be time to start my own computer repair shop. At competitive rates, I would be able to work one-fourth of my current hours and come out ahead. I'd also be able to set my own hours, wouldn't have to answer to disagreeable management, and I would be able to set an image for myself that I'm truly comfortable with. My consistently great customer satisfaction ratings have instilled a new-found confidence within me. That's for another thread, though.

Cons: this company is horribly organized.

This means parking fees could be under parking, or under travel, or weather, or anywhere or even not at all. Makes it very hard to maintain the illusion. 

A lot of customers will immediately hang up if they are told or figure out we are not on-site. Others will demand we give them a discount or some special rate because they are a special person, etc.

I work in customer service for a well-known online/mail-order retail company. I talk to customers via phone calls, emails, and chats (basically instant messaging sessions). Here is an email I received which I copied verbatim:

&gt;I wanted to let you know that I am not very happy with your customer service. I wanted my package for vacation next week and in order to receive it [in time] you want to charge me [an] extra 15.00. I had a similar problem with [a competitor] and they bent over backwards and had it overnighted with no extra charges. I understand different company and rules but the customer service reps could be nicer and act like they care about the customer's needs

This is an example of the type of contact I get that forces me to fight the urge to treat the customer like a child. Expedited shipping is a special service. The processing of the order in the warehouse is given priority, and UPS also gives it priority when shipping it, the cost of which is more expensive. If we gave everyone free expedited service, it would no longer be an expedited service. It shouldn't be my job to teach adults why certain services are *obviously* more expensive. Place your order sooner next time if you don't want to pay extra.

Telling me that some other company ""bent over backwards"" to give this customer the service for free does not help the situation, by the way.

This is probably gonna be a long one, so feel free to get comfortable. 

I work as a customer support consultant in a large-ish contact centre, dealing almost exclusively with inbound calls (we outbound only on customer request, or if something’s gone horribly wrong with their account). The work’s fairly straightforward – mostly cancellations, basic troubleshooting, general enquiries, etcetera. 

I’ve been here for ten months now and have become very good at my job. However, before I got this gig, I’d never worked customer support in my life. This is important, as the following exchange was my second ever call with the company. I will never forget it. 

Me: Good morning, you’re speaking with Cinelinguic. 

Customer: Yeah, I left my membership card at one of your stores. I need a new one. 

Me: No problem, sir. Can I confirm your name, date of birth, and address?

*Customer confirms his details*

Me: Thank you, I’ve just issued a replacement card. That should be out to you in about two weeks – 

Customer: Two weeks? You fucken kidding me?

Me: Our membership cards are produced by a separate company, sir. Once we send them the request, they –

Customer: This wouldn’t have happened if that fucken gook in the store hadn’t lost me fucken card.

Me: …

Customer: I tell you son, these fucken illegal immigrants are the scum of the fucken Earth. Thousands of em coming over in boats and taking jobs meant for honest fucken Australians. I reckon Hitler had the right idea, gas the c##ts or just straight up shoot em before they get off the fucken boats –

This is the point where pretty much all other consultants would have hung up, but this was my fourth day and my second call, and I was just sitting there in shock. The words this guy was saying are the sort of thing I attribute to stereotypical rednecks; I’d never actually expected someone to say this kind of filth to me in my lifetime. 

I was trying to get a word in edgeways, but the customer (an old man in his nineties, by the way) was having none of it. Dude must have been a drill sergeant or something when he was younger, because he never seemed to need to pause for breath, and any time I made an attempt to cut in he would talk right over the top of me like I wasn’t even there. 

Eventually …

Customer: Well, whadda ya think?

Me: … Uh, I don’t really have an opinion, sir. Your card should be out within two weeks. Can I help with anything else?

Customer: Nah mate, just remember to tell that fucken gook bastard in your store that – 

Me: Thanks for your call, have a great day. 

*Hits the disconnect button as quickly as possible.*

This entire incident, by the way, was entirely the customer’s fault. When membership cards are left behind in our stores, retailers send the cards back to us, where they are destroyed and reissued. The retailer had followed procedure exactly as he was supposed to; the only blame that fell on him was the misfortune to have been Asian. 

Hope I didn't bore anyone with that story. I'm sure it's something everyone gets now and then, but I've been wanting to get that off my chest for a while now.

M: How so?

C: Threatening me, lying to me. Last guy even called me names. He a racist*

*This lovely customer has a very Indian name, but I'm the only person he's dealt with and have never said anything like that

M: Oh dear. Well that is simply no good. If I can get you to send us an email with that representative's name and his comments we can investigate. I'll give you my name, it's Xenomorphia

C: 30 seconds of dead silence. Ahh nah man, it's cool. Forget it. 

M: This is actually quite a critical matter for us, we can't have any representatives acting like that. Do you mind holding while I transfer you to a supervisor so we can have this appropriately logged

C: Uh, yeah...sure

And that is how my dear, lying, friend had a 3 hour discussion with my supervisor and manager on speakerphone to the whole floor about how it's inappropriate to make such accusations and his policy will be cancelled, he will be flagged and never extended insurance with us again. I have also flagged his claim so all inbound calls come to me. I'm sure we're not even past the surface on this one. 

No-one mentioned the excess (deductible for you Americans, apparently) on this phone call, I did bump the repairs up just to get to the good stuff faster. Should have a final story by Friday

SIR,31,6,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/zopp4/if_you_insist_sir/,"Well, back at **info line**, we didn't just do subsidised care, there was a whole gamut of information services we offered.  Public health was probably the funniest, but that is many stories for other submissions.

Probably second busiest line (after subsidised care) was the subsidised medicines.  Quick summation:  

**Large list of common prescription medicine was available at a heavily subsidised rate.  If you were a pensioner of some description it was around $5 (less, but close enough), if you weren’t a pensioner, it was around $30.  Costs would add up during the calendar year, and if you go over a limit, costs drop to $5 for non-pensioners, free for pensioners**


As well as the usual callers of:

Caller: This is a new system, right?  

PtG: No madam, it is around 40 years old

Or:

Caller: Why can’t I get *so-and-so-medicine* under the subsidies?  

PtG: Because of *regulation 1* to *regulation 24*…  

Caller: Can’t you make an exception?

Or the ever popular:

Caller: Hey, maaaan!  My pharmacist refused me my methadone… you gotta help meeee!

We got some unusual mouth-breathers offering their insights into life as well. 

Probably three years before I started there, there was a change to the subsidy system.  There were limits on how much of each medicine you could buy at one time, whilst still having the cost subsidised.  The intent was to stop people stock piling medicine, and stop people trying to go over their limit early in the year.  There were exceptions, of course – e.g. travelling, ‘losing’ your prescription, need for extra repeats – and most people were more than fine with this.

A particular Mensa candidate wasn’t, however.

Mensa: I just went to the chemist, and my prescription was $30!  AND (sic) It doesn’t count towards my limit!  

PtG: *Well rehearsed explanation of policy, rudely cut off*  

Mensa: That’s what the pharmacist said!  **Blah, blah, blah… something about Vietnam I believe**.  I’M GOING TO JUMP UP AND DOWN ON THESE PILLS, THEN YOU’LL HAVE TO REPLACE THEM!  

Ptg: Well, that is your decision, **sir**, however your replacement prescription will be at full price as well

(the amount of self control I had to call him “sir” in a civilised manner would have impressed a Buddhist Monk)

Mensa: THIS BLOODY GOVERNMENT!  YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO RIP OFF THE WORKING CLASS!

Again, somehow **I** represent all of the Federal Government’s policies.  This guy was obviously not working class, but liked to present himself as an “Aussie Battler”… and bitch to whatever shock-jock he thinks is a brilliant journalist.

I currently operate a small (10 agent) call centre, but will be soon taking on a big new contract that will involve leasing new office space and hiring up to 30 more staff over the next year.
 
We run things a bit differently than most outfits in that we tend to ""apprentice"" new techs for at least a month, rather than giving them a script or flowchart that they must follow.  All of our staff have a great camaraderie going, and I want to try to keep that best I can.
 
We pay well above industry average salary, provide full health benefits, and give our staff the opportunity to advance to more technical (higher tier) positions by paying for any training they need.  We try to avoid using arbitrary metrics to judge performance (AHT can vary for all sorts of reasons), and instead audit random calls throughout the week and try to apply common sense where we can.
 
Is there anything you've seen in your work environment / processes that has been done exceptionally well?  Anything that you absolutely hate?  Any ideas on work environment (open concept versus private space?)

Part of our day-to-day tasks was to refer people to the correct number.  State funded organisations, federally funded organisations etc.

We could through-connect people, but as it was a free call to our number, the department was charged any call costs.  In extreme situations, however, we could through-connect.

Often people would be sick of whatever policy we were explaining, so we had a handy-dandy database of Federal Members; search by electorate, come back with their name, contact address and (sometimes) contact number for their office.

One guy calls in and asks to be connected to **current sitting Federal Treasurer**.  I try to pull the **Treasurer's** details from the handy-dandy database, but the guy stops me.

&gt;Oh, this is bloody typical of this government!  You never do ANYTHING!  I want you to connect me to **Treasurer** 

This threw me for a second.  I actually had to ask ""You seriously want me to connect you directly to **Treasurer**?""

&gt;YES!

""I'm sorry sir, but there is no way I can do that...""

I can just imagine the next press conference for **Treasurer**:

""Yes, I was going to give a brief of the next Federal Budget, but Jo from Cairns had a really important question that he just **needed** answered.  It had nothing to do with the budget... but HEY!

Then I got a call about saving money on my long-distance bills.  We need to save as much money as possible in this budget, so I **had** to listen to that...""

One of my daily tasks was to check a voicemail inbox intended for people who wanted to join a research panel regarding television programming for the visually impaired. The inbox was there for people to leave their name and contact information so that one of our agents could call them back to ask a few questions, just to see if they qualified for the panel. From there, it was out of our hands — we did not deal with the process of asking for their preferences of television programming or anything of the sort. Even if we did, the voicemail was intended solely for leaving contact information, not offering opinions. 

But of course, there were always people who would start off the message with ""Hi, my name is John Doe and I really think you should start airing this show on Thursdays instead of Mondays, because I have classes that night"" and so on, as if the voicemail inbox itself was the survey(s) they would eventually participate in, as members of the panel. Among that group was this one elderly man from a retirement home who started bombarding the inbox with pretty much the same message *every single day*. 

He was upset that the network had stopped airing reruns of La Femme Nikita mid-season and replaced it with Murdoch Mysteries. Like, *really* upset. He was always pretty much shouting when he got to this part of the message, after he'd left his name and number. He always guilted us by saying that a group of them at the retirement home used to always get together to watch it and now they have nothing to look forward to every day. I felt bad for him, but eventually got so, so sick of hearing his messages, since there was absolutely nothing I could do about it and he was lodging his constant complaints using *completely* the wrong vehicle. I eventually reached out to some higher-ups in the company and arranged for them to have the network themselves call him back to deal with his complaints, since we were just a 3rd-party call centre hired to recruit people and had nothing to do with the programming at all.

Yet another edit.  I sent the customer in question a rather lavish gift basket and a sorry with a card and my personal extension number if he ever needed anything else he could speak to me.


Edit 3:  Again yes I know I can't spell.  Also seniors is what we called the people who would deal with escalations etc.



As posted before I worked at a major Australian airline for a few years in their call centre dealing with Frequent Flyer Points.

One of the things I remember that could make your life a living hell or a peaceful walk through the flowers where the seniors.  We had our mix (like most call centres) of the Lazy, the pushovers, the ones that didn't know what they where doing and the great ones.

Basically I'm curious to here your stories about your seniors and how they made your life when working with them.

I'll start I guess.  When I first stated I worked in the bronze department which most members where so we handled the majority of calls and yes escalations over expired points, credit card issues and the usual call centre issues.  The story that comes to mind at the moment was one that shocked me at the time but what ended up happening after shocked me even more.

I had a call drop in and as always I introduced myself etc etc.  Pretty much the second I shut up the customer on the phone said I want to speak to a manager.  Well as you all know there would be no chance of that without finding out what happened first so I calm the customer down and explain that I need too know what's wrong so I can see if I can help before I escalate it.  It turns out that one of my colleges received a call from this customer about missing flight and was told to fuck off and hung up on.  When I heard this I was speechless I mean we've all wanted to tell a customer that but none of us where that stupid.  I asked the customer for the consultants name and when I heard it I knew straight away that the customer was telling the truth.  Anyway I put the customer on hold and go over and speak to the senior who was on duty we'll call him Frank.  So I wait for this senior to finish what he was doing on Facebook and he comes over.  

I introduce the call and it goes as one would imagine the customer was furious and really was looking at never flying with the airline again.  Long story short the call ends and I ask Frank what he intends on doing about it.  Basically I get told to mind my own business and work goes on as normal.  A couple of days later I was smoko with a few friends of mine and the incident comes up in conversation.  Basically Frank swept the incident under the carpet and nothing was done about it.  That was the day that I learnt you can do or say anything you like as long as your mates with the right people.

When a customer uses our service, they have 3 days to pay for the use. The customer enters their service number, the date they used it and then we take a payment.
The automated system reads back the information (Example, ""You are paying for service number xxxx for the date 29/03/2012, Is this correct?"") to which you are prompted to say YES or NO. The payment is then taken and a receipt is given.  If no payment is made then we send out bills (a first bill, then a reminder if the first is not paid) and if the bills are not paid the matter becomes a fine.

So, SRB (Self Righteous Bitch) calls tonight and gets me.
SRB Has fines. I advise SRB that fines need to be discussed with the infringement office (A different company to ours). SRB Still wants an explanation. The conversation is as follows.

Me: (after the first part of the conversation) So, please contact the infringement office to discuss this further or to dispute the charges.

SRB: Well, Who will give me an apology? And I believe I am due some compensation for the inconvenience (inconvenience being the fact she needed to call somewhere else)

Me: Please discuss this with the infringement office and they will determine what compensation should be offered. For the record, before this went to the infringement office, we sent you two bills. None of these bills were paid. This is why the matter is now with the infringement office.

SRB: Well this is YOUR systems fault. I paid for this service within the three days! I will go to the ombudsman about this!

(I then decide to check the payment anyway to see why it was even issued as a bill in the first place. Turns out the customer used the service on the 10th of march, 2012, but paid for use made on the 11th of march. I advise the customer of this and she goes off tap)

SRB: This isn't my fault! Your systems are stupid! I paid within the 3 days! I expect full compensation and a refund!

I'll preface this again with info about what I do, it's quite glamorous. I work in a call center for a large Canadian telecomm company, specially the business wireless (cell phone) billing department. I handle bills, price plans, upgrade hardware, and a bunch of stuff in between. 


Today is get a call from someone who's ""done being billed out the ass for stuff he's not using"". 
Sure whatever, no problem. So we go over his bill. He's got a plan that includes a certain amount of minutes for calling Canada /to the USA, a gps addon, an addon for Canadian text/data/call display /voice mail. A little over $150 for it. 

He starts in about paying for shit that he feels should be included. Specifically the texting to the USA. Because he's got a plan that allows calling to the USA and texting uses data and it takes seconds to broadcast so why does the plan not cover it? Well regardless of what portion of yhr network it uses or how long it takes to send, you're going to be billed PPU charges because you don't have an addon for it. Duh. 

We go back and forth for about 10 minutes because he can't grasp the simple concept of ""is it included in your plan? No? Then you have to pay for it."" 

Finally we move onto plans that would suit him. I explained it, feature by feature, line by line. ""This is so confusing! You're just throwing numbers at me!"". Really? You complain about your bill and all these ""hidden fees"" but you can't be bothered to listen to what the plans actually include? So I ask him if he wants me to repeat it so he can write it down. 15 minutes later, after repeating the details of everything 10± times, he accepts it. 

So we're done now, right? Wrong. He wants to argue about the current plan, again. ""well why is it called this when I'm billed for it? That's misleading"". Fair enough. It does say that. But it actually did include that, until you decided to ask for it to be removed. So regardless of what the plan says, you asked for that specific feature to be removed. So now you're billed for it. Imagine that? 

So after explaining everything, multiple times, he's not happy but he accepted it. ""All these other carriers offer better plans than what I had"".

But too many times, I get a call where they don't remember anything they put down and want to make changes are find out information. And somehow this turns into me deliberately stopping them. They just want to do whatever it is, it's their account this is ridiculous etc. 

Just once I want to agree it is ridiculous, because no amounts of explaining that its federal guidelines, the safety of the account, or its even devolved into 'I'm not saying you're not who you say you are, I'm saying we take the security of your account very seriously and unless you can verify this information, I can not help you, what if someone called in, said they were you and ordered a phone?'

It never helps. Then what seems like half the time, they've put an alert in the account saying no one is allowed to make changes except for them if they verify the pin or security question.

**customer** WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'm just moving the payment, you shouldn't be charging me anything!

**me** I understand the confusion m'am, but we absolutely have to debit the account, or else you would have $100 off on both accounts.

**customer** I DON'T WANT $100 OFF ON BOTH ACCOUNTS, I JUST WANT YOU TO MOVE THE PAYMENT!

**customer** NO! I'm seeing that you charged me $100, you're trying to steal money from me, I can't believe this!

**me** m'am, just to give you another example....if you buy something at a store, and then a week later you return it.....at first you had a debit in your account, and then a credit, so it adds up to $0, correct?

**customer** yes...

**me** well we did the opposite...you GAVE us money, and then asked for it back, so we gave it to you...that's a credit and then a debit...it adds up to $0, you just happen to then apply a payment to a different account.

**customer** NO, YOU NEVER GAVE THE MONEY BACK TO ME..........what is so hard to understand, I want you to move the payment, but you shouldn't be charging me $100

**me** m'am, I'm truly sorry but there's no other way....to move a payment from one account to another, we HAVE to take the payment off of the account-- and we can only do that by debiting it.

**customer** DID YOU EVEN FUCKING FINISH HIGH SCHOOL? Are you high?! You're not making any sense!

**me** no m'am, I assure you that I am not high and I did indeed finish high school. I promise you that everything has been properly done, and it adds up to $0. We did not charge you anything, we simply moved the payment from one account to the other.

I had to quit after that short time because I was failing in school from working 30 hours a week. (The call center was my second job to try to afford to live. I worked 4-5 days a week from 5-8pm at the call center). Sucked because the managers and most of the staff were super cool people who I loved working with. They would also let people down on their luck sleep in the call center from time to time. I mean seriously these people cared about their employees. 

It was a super low tech operation where we had paper of varying sizes with all the information on them. You'd get assigned to one campaign a night and given a stack of papers to call. Most of the managers were understanding and would keep people who knew their stuff on a single campaign for the duration. 

The big thing with them was to get people to donate via credit card as it was an assured amount (versus mailing them information). There was a weekly bonus for the person who could get the most number of credit cards and things like that. 

Some of the worst calls I made were for the local AIDS agency. Oh god I hated that campaign with all my being. Most of the information for this campaign was via the ""Dinner for a Cause"" sort of thing where people would totally forget that they put their own name on the damn list after filling out the OPTIONAL card at dinner. Nothing like getting screamed at and being told you illegally obtained their number. And then you would have to ask about a donation by which point they would scream some more and hopefully hang up. 

Another nuance of some campaigns was that people could designate departments for their donation. I was on the tail end of the local public library campaign and had a man refuse to donate unless I could guarantee that his $20 would go towards ""keeping the library open longer. You know for the kids"". I tried with all my might and patience to explain to him the options and that the best I could do was check ""Operations"" but no this did not satisfy him and he hung up. 

The company was very strict on calling hours, but it never failed that every night you'd get at least a dozen people complaining that you called during dinner or what not. Right before I left the company, I made a call at about 7:50pm so it was pretty much my last call. 
a woman answered the phone and after my greeting proceeded to SCREAM at me about how inappropriate it was for me to call her at ""this hour"" and that I had woken her up and now her sleep was ruined. I handed her off to a supervisor after her many demands and one of my co-workers consoled me as he could hear the entire conversation because she was screaming so loud. 

The big no-no was to answer incoming calls from your assigned line for the night. If your phone rang for some reason you were supposed to let it ring. If it kept ringing, a manager would come and answer the phone to try to resolve the issue. (Usually it was someone who we had previously called and they didn't answer. They were calling back to interrogate us.) If someone's phone rang, you could hear a pin drop in the place; everyone would freeze and stare at the person and the phone waiting to see what happened. There was a new guy working and he apparently forgot this whole deal and actually answered the ringing phone. Most of us sat there with our jaws on the floor as he proceeded to YELL at the person on the other end of the line. Once he hung up looking smug and satisfied, the owner came by and he was fired on the spot. If I remember correctly he left yelling obscenities about the company while most of us had to hold calls.

&gt;She promised her son that she would help him pay for his wedding, so she was going to use the money that was in her current bank account and have the payment come out of her other bank account, but it was really important that she make this change and her account remain paid up because her health insurance was really important because she was going to have some claims coming in and the reason she had some claims coming in was because she was driving along with all of the windows of her car up on a really hot day and she passed out and ran off the road into a ditch, but she had to keep the windows up because she was taking her dogs to the vet and she always had to keep the windows up with her dogs in the car, even though it was a really hot day, because a while ago, she had some West Highland White Terriers and she had her window rolled down at the drive-thru at McDonald's and one of the dogs had jumped out the window and ran down an embankment and got hit by a car and killed and she had driven all the way from California to Colorado to get that dog and she'll never have a Westie again because of what happened and she was so happy that I was talking with her because she's bipolar, so she tends to talk a lot, or at least that's what people say, and I was so nice to not be rude to her because some people are SO RUDE and pretend that they have another call on another line just to get her off the phone.

Interspersed within this story, she would randomly interject (is it interjecting if you do it to yourself?) with what I actually needed. Like...""And I'll never have a Westie again. No, never, after all that. Oh, and did you need my routing number? It's 123456789. Even though they are really cute dogs, I'll never have one again.""

me: and your name?
lady: *gives name*

me: *i confirm that she's calling to activate the card and notice that she is listed as an Additional cardholder, meaning she's an authorized user on the account, but doesn't have any kind of real authority or power over the account. this specific bank requires us to speak to the primary or secondary cardholder, thus the derping ensued...*

me: and is the primary accountholder available to speak with?

lady: whats the problem?

me: no problem, Your Bank just requires us to speak to the primary cardholder when activating manually over the phone.

lady: so whats the problem?

me: ..... *are you serious?* i dont see you listed as the primary on this account ma'am.

lady: i know. my husband is. so whats the problem?

me: *broken record this one* im sorry ma'am but i have to speak to him in order to activate the card.

lady: well this is ridiculous! he's not available right now and what if he were dead?? would you still need to talk to him then??

me: *well technically yes* ma'am im sorry but i cant activate the card with you.

lady: i wanna talk to your manager. *DING DING DING WE HAVE AN IDIOT FOLKS! :D*

T-Mobile Employees
 

To:                 T-Mobile Employees  
Subject:       The Challenger Imperative

 

 

 

This message is intended for T-Mobile USA employees only and is not to be shared or distributed outside of T-Mobile USA *oops*

 

 

As you’ve heard today, T-Mobile is shaking up the wireless industry with our bold vision and willingness to challenge the status quo. Our mission is simple: free American consumers from the unnecessary costs and complexities of frustrating industry practices and norms.

 

This is an aggressive play that suits us perfectly as the challenger in this market. Everything we do must fall within the Challenger Strategy. We can’t lose sight of that. A recap of where we are now:

 

Amazing 4G Services. Our modernization efforts are humming along. We’ll have a smokin’, state-of-the-art 4G LTE network reaching 200 million Americans by year’s end. And this will be built on an enhanced spectrum position after the MetroPCS deal closes.
 
Value Leader. We will offer unmatched value through unprecedented transparency, simplicity and fairness. That includes remarkably simple rate plans and services—and an end to overages and unnecessary fees. It means making the latest devices available—for amazing prices and on the customer’s terms.
 
Trusted Brand. The work we’re doing on our brand re-launch is very exciting. Still, the brand marketing can only go so far in earning American consumers’ trust. We’re also going to offer an unrivalled, hassle-free customer experience at every moment of truth. No exceptions.
 
Multi-segment Player. We’re making very smart, focused investments to grow B2B and our MVNO strategy and there’s still more work to do.
 
Challenger Business Model. If we’re going to be aggressive, we need a cost structure that allows us to attack and a reserve of capital to reinvest in the business. And, if we work together, we have an opportunity to simplify processes so that we do fewer things, and are able to do them better.
 
To transform the industry we will have to force it to change…..and the only way to do that is by transforming ourselves in every respect.
 
We can do it. I’ve led teams before who’ve done it, and this team is the best I’ve ever had the opportunity to lead.
 
Here are the compelling arguments for getting on with it now…..
 
Right now our company needs to start growing our customer base, and—right now—we are not;
Right now we’re preparing to become a public company. We’re going to have to show investors that we can earn a great return on their investment and—right now—we are not;
Right now we have to secure our competitive position in the industry, and—as the No. 4 player—we’re vulnerable;
If we do not transform this company right now, we will be vulnerable to change that will be imposed on us by the forces of the marketplace.
 
How do we do it…..
 
We must  give customers a compelling, differentiated offering;
We must  give investors a compelling reason to invest in our company;
We must give ourselves a compelling reason to invest our time and talents;
We must re-think our business top to bottom, left to right, and front to back;
We must move with agility and speed, because time is our enemy;
We must be totally focused on the things that are absolutely, fundamentally critical to customers, investors and ourselves.
 
This is hard work…..
 
It means taking nothing for granted;
It means letting go of ideas and projects that are marginal, nice to have, or which will not materially advance our transformation;
It means we have to stay focused, think big and bold;
It means we have to sweat the details on execution;
It means we have to make sacrifices and investments before we can reap the rewards.
 
We have done part of this work already…..
 
I believe (and my belief is supported by the reaction we’re already getting from the market) in what we’ve already announced about our Un-Carrier promise, about the experience our network will deliver, and the unrivaled customer experience we’ll deliver.  So, we have a lot of this planned out and are beginning to execute against these promises.
 
Now it’s time to deliver on our commitment to customers, investors—and to ourselves…..
 
Delivering on these promises will take additional investment before we can earn a return. And to make this sustainable, we’ll have to have a business model and cost structure that will support our aggressive market positioning. Having a cost structure that mirrors the big carriers won’t work. But, by simplifying our business model just like we’re simplifying the way consumers buy wireless, we're creating a very attractive proposition for investors and making a much stronger case for the moves we’re making in the marketplace.
 
Developing the Un-Carrier promise is the first of three steps we have to take…..
 
Creating an efficient, zero-waste cost structure is the second. And accelerating the execution of this strategy through the acquisition of MetroPCS is the third step.
 
To get to an Un-Carrier cost structure, the Senior Leadership Team has begun identifying current business initiatives and activities that don’t fit with our simplified Un-Carrier approach and put a stop order on these. Many of these activities create downstream work—particularly for valuable IT resources critical to enabling our transformational moves. As we move to a vastly simplified product portfolio and customer experience, leaders are taking action to focus on activities that align fully with the Un-Carrier promise.  Initiatives that better support our frontline customer service representatives and retail store associates continue to be a top priority.

 

As part of this total re-examination of the cost structure, decisions have been made about policies that relate to travel, meals, entertainment, energy, real estate and a wide range of business expenses. New guidelines on these items will be out to you shortly.

 

In addition, we’ve made a broad set of decisions that will be implemented across the company. These will help us reach our cost structure and business model goals more quickly, and will prepare us for our debut as a public company on the completion of our acquisition of MetroPCS.

 

We are pausing on bringing new hires into the business. Should there be a position vacancy that is determined to be essential for the success of the business an exception may be granted by one of the executive vice presidents. We are also minimizing the use of contract and temporary hires. Leaders will continue to evaluate the needs of customer touch points and hire frontline employees as needed to ensure a high quality customer experience.

 

Instead of moving forward with salary increases, as we would typically do in March each year, salaries will remain at current levels pending further review and the finalization of the integration of MetroPCS.  This is appropriate given the many transition and integration decisions that need to be made this year.

 
Beginning February 22, we will stop the discounted device purchase feature of the employee phone program. By late summer, employees will have access to a program that is similar to how our customers purchase devices. No changes are planned to be made to the monthly service plan aspect of this benefit.  Details on this will be distributed to you in the next few days.   As we work our way through the integration with MetroPCS over the course of the coming year, we will be reviewing and harmonizing all of our benefit plans.
 

I ask everyone to take the challenge to identify ways to simplify and eliminate re-work and initiatives that won’t strengthen our Un-Carrier position.  And let’s do this as we stay focused on creating the best end-to-end customer experience, bar none.

 

The Senior Leadership Team and I are working hard to make each employee an owner of our company, so that we all can share in the value we’re creating.  By aligning around these principles and by pulling together, we can build our company into one that will be the envy of the industry — and we will all share in the pride that we were the ones who built it.
 
Let’s go win!

1358284671.0,18,self.talesfromcallcenters,16n2zf,Talking a drunk installer out of working with electricity on top of a 30-foot pole. ,18,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/16n2zf/talking_a_drunk_installer_out_of_working_with/,"Years ago I worked for a security manufacturer who sold its products through distributors.  The distributors would resell to installers and customers.

I was an engineering technician at this company, and besides my regular engineering duties I was also expected to spend several hours a week on customer service queue, answering customer problems.  This could get pretty involved since we had a ""cradle to grave"" policy of being in charge of supporting a customer until the issue was completely resolved.  

So, Friday afternoon before a 3 day weekend (Fourth of July, 1999), I'm on queue and hoping the phone won't ring.  Of course it does, at 4:50 pm, I'm due off work at 5.

The customer is an installer who wants to know how to connect one of our remote security cameras to the installation he has on a parking lot light pole.  He had an electrician come in earlier in the day and install the power and video cable, he just needs to bolt the camera mount to the pole, connect the transformer to power, and properly wire the transformer to the camera.  Then plug in the video and camera data communication wires. 

The thing is, he just got out of an office party, and he's drunk.  

His plan is to put a 30 foot aluminum extension ladder on the side of this steel pole, climb up with 15 pounds of equipment, tools, and multimeter, and install the equipment.  He just needs to know, does he connect the blue wires to the white wires or what?  ""The instructions aren't really clear!""

The instructions are VERY clear.  We even have a graphic of how to connect everything.  But my first attempts to explain it seem to go right over his head.  Very quickly, I realize he is REALLY drunk, and I start getting worried.  

First, a ladder?  Really?  We recommend proper safety equipment and a boom or scissor lift of some sort.  Not to mention that he'll be up there splicing a transformer onto 120VAC.  This guy's drunken plan seems disastrous!

I tried to be tactful, suggesting that he wait until Tuesday morning to install it.  ""But I've got everything here now!  Now's a GREAT time to install this!""

I asked him if there was anyone else there to help him out.  ""Naw, I've done this hundreds of times!  They'd just get in my way!""  

We were going in circles, and he was slurring.  I was on the phone with him for more than an hour trying to get him to re-think this.  From his point of view, he started thinking we were ""just talking"".  He lost track of his goal, and he admitted to me he'd been sipping whisky while on the phone with me (so he wasn't sobering up!).

Finally, he seemed to forget the whole ""Must Install Camera Now"" idea, and from the drunken conversation, I realized that he thought he was talking to a friend.

""Is that party still going on Jed?"" (not his real name!)

""No, I think it's broken up.  It's almost... (I can HEAR him squinting at a clock or watch or something) almost 9PM!  Shit!  I need to be home!""

I then spent another 20 minutes talking him out of driving home.  I didn't know what city he was in, nor did I know if he had cab fare, but I tried to bring that up.

""'Sokay, just call my old Lady!  She won't mind!"" He then gave me a phone number.  I quickly put him on hold and dialed the number.

""Hello, this is Calladus from (company).  Could I speak to Mrs. Jed?""

She sighed, and said, ""What's he done now?""

She actually seemed to cheer up when I told her, and she told me she would pick up her husband right away.  I got back on the line with Jed and talked to him for another 15 minutes until his wife arrived.

And I got to go home almost 3 hours late, to explain to MY wife why I was so late.

***Wall of text ahead***


So I work for this information resource, we are basically the phonebook and google combined and we get constant calls, on a very busy day(almost every day) we get two to three calls per minute. I'm a twenty year old female, and I wish I wasn't doing this job.



I have vented to my friends, but now I’ve found you, I just got to let the words flow, yanno?

**Night shift**

So my first story happened on a night shift, I love working nights, there normally three calls or so per hour, maybe fifteen if it is busy. You can just watch movies or play games, knit or read, it is the dream work. 

But this one instant a guy called and wanted me to connect him to a phone sex number. He was obviously very aroused and his voice raspy and made me feel uncomfortable. I can’t connect to the sex lines, so I just told him the number. He wasn’t happy and wanted some other number. I gave him some foreign number, because we have only this one sex line in my country. He didn’t want foreign gals to talk naughty to them either, appearantly he wanted me. After he told me that, I hung up in disgust.

But as very few people call on nights, the line wasn’t busy and he called again and got right through. As there is a policy to not hang up on customers I tried to keep my calm, but then he started to talk about how he had tied a band around is cock and how throbbing, red and ready he was for me. I hung up again.

He called the third time, but I couldn’t handle it, I snapped and shouted at him that I was not a sex worker, I did not sign up for this and he should never call again. It wasn’t right of me to do as we’re supposed to be so compassionate and polite to customers, but I couldn’t handle it. 

**TV channel**

And this company also answers the phones for a TV channel.
I’m not going to name any instant, because I cannot name the countless instances of people saying that they are going to sue us or sue me because they did not pay their bills, and it takes 24 hours for the payment to go through.

**Back to the information center;**

A man called and he was looking for a woman, let’s call her Jane Johnson, on Street Lane 12.
I did not find Jane Johnson on Street Lane 12 and he got a little annoyed, that’s okay that happens. Then he asked for ...hmmm.. Smith Johnsson also on Street Lane 12, but he was also unregistered. I told the caller that and he got very angry. I told him that I was sorry, tried to tell him that people control their registration themselves. He started shouting asked if their son was registered, but Teenager Johnson wasn’t and then he shouted something about if Street Lane even existed. And then he hung up(Street Lane doesn’t, but the street he was really wondering about does.)

I alluded in my last post that I worked for an information line surrounding policy on government subsidised care.  Crazy Lady was, I believe, in this care.  If she wasn't, she damn well should have been.

She started just going off on her crazy rants, but after several years of this (and no, I'm not exaggerating) she would start out fairly normal, and then suddenly, without any warning, just blow her top and start ranting and raving.

Such accusations leveled at these cars places included (but were not limited to)

* Burying residents on their grounds, then continuing to collect their pension cheques

* All workers in this industry were blood-suckers.  I, by association - I wasn't associated - was also a blood sucker

* All subsidised care centres were part of a national conspiracy to fleece residents of all they were worth (was this before or after they were buried I wonder)

* Tax money had been diverted to fund this conspiracy

and so on and so forth.

I should point out that all of these centres were privately owned, the only connection one had to another was the subsidies they received, and therefore the level of care they were required to give.

Crazy Lady somehow got the idea that all centres across the country were all connected.

I used to just hang up on her, but some of the veterans of this centre would let her go on just for the laffs

I am one of a number of reps who processes payments. So a good portion of my daily calls are specifically for taking payments.

Now when you first call in, our piece of shit automated system will ask you to punch in your SSN or some other info. Then it asks if you'd like to make a payment. Now, since our department has no interests in upgrading our tech, if you want to make a payment, you get transferred to a representative. Now this representative will ask you to re-verify your information. They will then ask you ""how can I help you today?""

Now, these people are calling in explicitly to make a payment. So they say ""I need to make a payment.""

""Ok, I need to transfer you to a credit card representative.""

(That's how advanced our department is.)

Transfer to a credit card rep. Now, I will come on the line and identify myself and the fact that I will be processing the payment. I verify the amount they want to pay. I verify the name on the card is theirs. 

At this point, these people have a) called in with the intention of making a payment, b) have been asked by the automated system if they were making a payment, c) told the first rep you wanted to make a payment, d) were told they are being transferred to a payment rep, e) reached a rep who *explicitly* says they're there to process a payment and f) have been asked to verify the payment itself.

I got a call from someone in Quebec asking if I spoke French. I do not. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate French Canadians *that* much, but they always seem to be the worst people to deal with (right after old people). For those of you who don't know, their accents are usually *really* thick. I deal with people's accents all of the time. And I still have trouble with French Canadians. So I got to deal with that through the whole call.

This guy told me that his first station (zone, area, whatever you want to call it) would stay on when the timer moved to the next section. So then he had two stations running at the same time. So I start off doing what I usually do. I run through it manually.

When we run through it manually, it's just like when the timer is programmed to come on. Only we don't have to wait for each station to water the whole time. So it's a lot faster and a lot more convenient.

We get through the manual watering fine. Everything was working fine. So we check the programming on his timer. That's fine too. He insists on programming it to come on in a minute to see what happens. That is also fine.

He can't tell me anything other than it sometimes won't shut off station 1. He doesn't know what the timer says when it is doing that. He doesn't know anything else.

I give him a few possibilities as to what it could be and tell him to watch it and take note of what it shows on the display if the problem happens again. I thought that was the end of it.

It wasn't.

He insists that I tell him what is wrong with his timer.

I told him that I didn't know what was happening since we just ran through everything and everything was working. It's just like telling someone that your hot pockets always explode and demonstrating it for them. Except it doesn't explode this time. But you still demand for them to tell you why their hot pockets always explode.

Impossible.

I explained this to him about 5 times. He didn't get it. I explained what the problem could be about 5 times. He wouldn't let it go.

20 minutes later, he finally just decides to watch it and call back if it happens again.

I work for an answering service, we take calls for mostly doctors offices, but we have all types of clients.  I work overnight, and am the only operator at this location from 11p-7a.  I have almost 7 years experience working for another answering service, but they shut down at the end of May.  I've been with this company a little over a month.  I'm still learning the clients, and anyone who has done any kind of experience with Answering Services knows that each client has its own special quirks.  Also, this particular evening, I have not slept well, and didn't have time to eat before work, so I'm all ready on edge.

This particular caller had been evicted from his apartment earlier that afternoon.  There was a note on the account that reflected such.

Of course, since he's a little angel, he doesn't mention the eviction, and when I mention that he's been evicted, he says he's gotten it all straightened out, and it's just that his key fob is just broken.  I'm skeptical, but I call the on call person just to be sure.  They corroberate that he has been evicted.  They, of course, won't speak with him, so I have the unpleasant task of telling him that no, in fact, his key fob is not broken, he has definitely been evicted.

Cue a lot of screaming and cursing, threat making, and generally showing his ass.  

I understand that he's upset, eviction can't be fun, but my hands are figuratively tied.  I've done my part, I advise him as such.  I even call management again to see if they'll talk to him.  They say no, and are understandably peeved to be called.  I speak to the caller again, and tell him I've now called management twice, they've said no, they won't let him in, both times. 

Suddenly, he's strangely calm.  He says thank you and hangs up.  I am bracing myself for it now.  It's never a good thing when someone that angry gets calm out of thin air.

Thirty seconds later, the phone rings again.  It's Mr. Eviction.

""Can I speak to (Manager) or (secretary)?""  It's after midnight at this point.  I tell him no, and ask him that he call back at 9 when the office opens.  He says ""Thank you, I'll try back later.""

Later turns out to be every thirty seconds for the next hour and 45 minutes.  Same thing, every single time.  ""I'll try back later.""  He's preventing me from answering other calls quickly, he's preventing me from doing my paper work, preventing me from eating my dinner, and moreover, he's just pissing me off.

Now, at my old job, I would have just stuck him on hold each time he called, or hung up on him.  However, this new job is really strict about hold times, call abadons (calls that go unanswered, or are less than 5 seconds long), *and* ring times.  We're closely moinitored by our local manager, and by coorporate, and have to run a number of reports each day to reflect our statistics.  Operators with habitually high stats are ""investigated"".  After over an hour of repeating the same phrases over and over again, I was getting ready to just contact the police.  I mean, at this point he's a prank caller, right?

I decided before I did that, I would contact my boss.  I felt like a total ass calling her in the middle of the night, but since I'm still so new, I wasn't sure if she thought I should call the cops, or continue to allow him to fuck up our call stats by placing him on penalty hold, or if I should try management again.  In retrospect, I probably should have just placed him on penalty hold, but between being frustrated and worried about my numbers (we just had a meeting about our numbers as a whole and our monitors, etc), I guess I just wanted someone to hold my hand through the process.  I miss my training wheels.

My boss told me to put her on hold and answer the call that was coming in.  I thought it would be Mr. Eviction, but instead it was the manager that I spoke with twice earlier in the night.  ""Can you connect me to [Mr. Eviction]?""

Really?  *NOW* you want to talk to him?  I place him on hold as well. A few seconds later, Mr Eviction calls in right on time.  I connect Mr. Eviction and the Manager, and I guess they have a hug fest, or whatever.  I don't know if they let him in, or told him to go to hell.  I am assuming they let him in.  You'll see why below.

I go back to my boss and tell her what happened.  I know she is probably ready to smack me, but she just laughs.  Good boss.

Mr. Eviction called back about an hour later and apologized for calling ""about a million times.""  I know I should have said ""Thanks,""  But all I could muster was ""uh-huh.""  If I never hear that man's voice again, it will be too soon.

At least he apologized, but now he thinks that if he exhibits that kind of behavior in the future, he'll get what he wants, which is what irritates me the most.

TL;DR: Guy is evicted from his apartment, management won't talk to him. He calls back every 30 seconds for almost 2 hrs until management decides they will talk to him.  Unwanted behavior is reinforced.

Aside from drinking copious amounts of alcohol, or just forcing myself mentally to remain positive among an onslaught of negativity/stupidity every day, what would you suggest to avoid burnout?

I have a lot of hobbies, I am very active outside of work, hang out with friends, exercise, and spend a lot of time outdoors. I realized early on that coming home and watching TV or playing video games everyday would deteriorate my mental health extremely fast. Even though I do everything I can to enrich my life outside work, it's extremely hard to stay positive and energized when I deal with the worst portion of humanity for 8 hours a day.

Venting is always a great way to find some relief, but between calls and on breaks is seldom an option. Cubicles are close, mics are sensitive, and callers can hear pretty much everything anyone in the vicinity says.

My idea was to have a weekly happy hour where we do nothing but vent over some pizza and beer at a place across the street, but interest doesn't seem to be high. Group therapy + beer seems to be key, and I'm going to keep pushing for it.

I'm an answering service.  We answer for lots of things, not the least of which is a major coffee supply company who contracts us to dispatch to their repair people.  When someone's coffee maker goes tits up, we're the ones those people call and set up work orders with.  

Unfortunately, this means we answer for people *everywhere* and apparently there is an accent somewhere that is some mixture of lower New Jersey and Puerto Rico.  This gets *way* worse when the caller is surly from the outset.  This woman might have been thirty, but she had that chainsmoker grumble that makes everyone sound a hundred and five. 

For the sake of clarity, I'll be posting what I heard versus my rough translations.  

I picked up the phone and the call went something like this:

Me: Hello, such-and-such customer service.  How can I help you?

Woman:Choo feex ar coffee meeker?  We a nee' an coffee meeker feexed.  Feckin' ting is not feckin' workie agahn.  

(Do you fix coffee makers?  We need a coffee maker fixed.  Fucking thing is not fucking working again.)

Me, in my super-friendly, do-not-call-the-fuckwit-a-fuckwit voice: Certainly ma'am, we can help with that.  May I have your zip code?

Woman: Wha choo nee my zeep co' for?  Just nee coffee meeker feexed.  
 
(What do you need my zip code for?  Just need coffee maker fixed.)

Me:We need to look up your account, ma'am.  

Woman: Oh seben oh oh un.  

I put this in and discover we don't have any accounts in that area.

Me:I'm afraid we're not showing anything in that area.  Is there a zip code near yours or has it been split recently?

Woman:My co' same as always be!  You feckin' stupid?  I haven' move in liiike fi year!

(My code same as always be.  You fucking stupid?  I haven't moved in like five years.) 

Me:We need the zip-code for your business, ma'am.  

Woman:Oh...(She'd given me her house code.  She rattles off another incomprehensible series of numbers.  I consider drinking the hand sanitizer.)  

Me:Alright, thank you.  What's your business name?

Woman:Don' you 'ave it?  

(Don't you have it?)

Me:We answer for literally thousands of companies and there are dozens in your area. (maybe a little more forcefully than necessary) What is your business name?

Women: You dun' 'ave to geet smart alec wid me.  Rude fecker.  Jus' nee' coffee meeker fix.

(You don't have to be a smart alec with me.  Rude fucker.  Just need Coffee maker fixed.)

Me:I can take a work order for you, but I'll need your company name.  

Woman:You 'ave eet!  Is stupid?  (She gives me the name and it takes me a full ten seconds to parse, during which I can hear her clicking what I can only imagine are six inch long, fake fingernails on her desk.)

I realize here that she has several dozen items from us on her account.  This is a nightmare scenario, because we require long, elaborate serial numbers and a series of questions to identify the items.  

I decide to go into defcon 3.  

Me:(gently tapping my microphone while speaking) Ma'am we seem to have a bad connection.  Could you call us back?

Her:I hear jus' fine, for feck sak.  Is you going to 'elp or not?

Me:Ooh, sorry, can't hear you very well.  Could you repeat that?

Her:You fecking with me?  I sit for fi minute on 'old an' you fecking shittin' with me?  (Keep in mind, she's calling on Monday after 6:00 AM, the BUSIEST period of the week.) 

Me:Sorry, ma'am.  Can't understand you.  Could you ring back?

Her:I wanna feckin' speeeeek to you' supervicer!  Mebe they unner'stan' me!

Me:Ma'am?  Are you there?  Hello? (jiggling my microphone jack so it spurts static down the line.) 

The phone on her end slams and I breathe a long, slow sigh of relief.  Thank the gods she didn't call back.  I don't know that I could have done that twice.

I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a bit, but until now I have had nothing worthy of posting.

A bit of background: I work for a major US credit card processor on the third shift. We have many things that our call center handles, so many of us have multiple skillsets. I myself wear the hats of basic terminal tech support, voice authorization for credit cards, tax/money transfer, new account activations, PC product support, and the subject of our tale tonight, casino cash advances.

Now, the casino subset of our company is a service that is provided by roughly 400 casinos in the US/Canada for you to get cash advances on your credit card from a handy kiosk in the casino. You swipe the card on the little pad, follow the prompts, and hopefully it gets approved. If additional information is needed, the screen instructs you to pick up the phone which rings to one of us at the desk. 

Of course, seeing as your typical human doesn't like noticing things, or reading, or listening, we get some real characters. Either people have just picked up the phone without doing the initial steps, or they think it is a payphone and want to order pizza, or you get people like the guy I will now tell you about. 

*Note: this happened to my coworker who sits next to me, but her phone was on speakerphone, so I got to hear the lovely customer.*

Coworker: Thank you for calling Blah Company, this is Coworker, how may I assist you?    
CasinoGuy: .........what?    
Coworker: How may i assist you?    
CasinoGuy: What did you just say to me? What is this? I'll blahblah.....    

*At this point he starts rambling incoherently about nothing in particular, and we realize that he is super drunk.*

Coworker: Sir, I don't mean to cut you off, but what are you attempting to do?    
CasinoGuy: .......what?    
Coworker: What are you trying to do, sir?    
CasinoGuy: I'm trying to get my money!    
Coworker: Alright, have you swiped your card on the kiosk sir?    
CasinoGuy: Did I what my card?    
Coworker: Did you swipe your credit card on the kiosk?    
CasinoGuy: **What does this have to do with me!?**

At this point, all six of us night shifters burst out laughing, including our supervisor. Sometimes, you just can't help it. My coworker had her phone muted for that moment, so we were ok.

Coworker: I'm sorry sir, but you have have to swipe your card on the kiosk to begin the process.    
CasinoGuy: *What does this have to do with me!?*    
Coworker: Sir, you have to swipe your card.    
CasinoGuy: Ok....fine....I swiped it.    

At this point he begins pressing things on the kiosk, making the phone beep, and just hangs up. We all had a laugh, and the night continues.

--------------------------------------

Phrases she used included (but were not limited to):

*""This is really affecting my coworkers since I cant do my job.""*

*""I need to get this fixed NOW.""*

*""Today is my Monday, so this shouldn't be a problem.""* -lol, wut?

--------------------------------------

**Not to mention that...** she kept talking to someone next to her so I was getting confused as to what she was telling me and what she was telling the other person.

When I'd ask her to clarify something she meant (or when I'd try repeating back to her what I heard her reporting to me), she'd snap at me like, *""I'm not talking to you! This is affecting everyone around me, you know? I need to get my work done!""*

Okay, fine...

--------------------------------------

I finally narrow down her problem into two seperate tickets that need to be escalated for assistance (even **simple** issues usually get routed to different groups to be handled, we are mostly in charge of recording the issues, and making sure they are assigned to the appropriate place)-

1. When she's logging in using her ID, a different workers name appears

2. When trying to access her worker schedule, it tells her that her username or password is invalid

Mind you, neither of these issues is unheard of, and should be a fairly easy fix.

**Finally I'm about to wrap this call up!** Yay me :)

So I said, *""Okay, let me give you your two ticket numbers for the issues you reported, the one for your scheduling issue...""*

**Me:** ??? Okay...

She carries on... *""You dont know what its like to have to be taking calls all day long. It's very stressful. We are already reallly REALLY busy and you need to fix this NOW.""*

Really??? I DON'T know what thats like? This is news to me as I've been doing this job for 2.5 years now.

2. If you type out a fragmented confusing sentence and I ask you for clarification, do not copy and paste the exact same thing.

We went around in circles for a while until she finally read me the actual error &amp; I figured out that the reason her birthday was “wrong” was because the *format* of her birthday was wrong. She was typing in xx-xx-xx &amp; she should have been typing in xx/xx/xxxx (which it said above the field, but I digress). Once we got that fixed, it was still giving her an error message.

**IT'S TELLING ME MY PASSWORD IS WRONG. THERE'S NOWHERE TO PUT IN MY PASSWORD.**

I was looking at the exact screen she was looking at &amp; I could see that the website was split down the middle into columns. On the left column was where it wanted all the demographic information &amp; on the right column, it asked for you to choose a username, a password, &amp; to enter your e-mail address. On the right side was also where the Submit button was.

So I asked her if she saw the questions on the right that she had to answer. 

**YOU MEAN I HAVE TO FILL ALL OF THAT OUT, TOO?! THIS IS RIDICULOUS. THIS WEBSITE IS RIDICULOUS.**

Yes, because it assumed you would know to fill out all the blank places, it's ridiculous. Finally, she filled that part out, too, &amp; everything worked lovely...but not after she screamed at me some more about how much our website sucked for making her fill out four extra fields (it asked for the password twice) she didn't see despite clicking the Submit button right beneath them.

Though there are a lot of negative stories and bloody funny ones too I thought I might post about some of the great customers that I had while working there.  I should note that I haven't worked for this company for about 3 years so the fact that I can remember them makes them pretty special.

Story 1
One of the first amazing customers I had was for a couple who where waiting in LAX for their flight back to SYD.   Long story short they had  complimentary access pass to use the departure lounge but it was being refused by the lounge staff.  After speaking to the customers Dad and then ringing the customer on his mobile I'd worked out that the club was at fault.  I told the customer to head back to the club and I would have it sorted.  

So I rang the lounge at LAX spoke to the person and got it sorted.  (Turns out it wasn't the fault of the lounge staff or the customer some one forgot to send them an email about this offer.)  So anyway everything was sorted and I went back to answering calls.  About a week later I came in one morning and there was an email from the customer thanking me for the service that I provided them.  I know it sounds silly but I was really touched that they took the time to thank me and send me that email.

Story 2.

I had been promoted to Premier by this point.  (Premier means the customer who fly so much that they have earned status.  Some of these members where known for spending well over 100,000 dollars a year so they where special.)

This lady calls in and told me of her airline nightmare, she wasn't flying with us but one of our partner airlines.   She needed to go to a conference in Switzerland and was booked to go from Melbourne to London via Hong Kong then onto Zurich in business class.  Well everything was fine from Melbourne to Hong Kong however once she hit Hong Kong her nightmare began.  The flight she was meant to travel on was cancelled and she was rebooked on to another flight leaving later that day.  About 2 hours before departure the new flight had been cancelled and yet again she was rebooked but in economy this time.  The flight eventually left but because she was now an economy passenger they made her pay for extra baggage (I don't understand that one myself).  

Well she finally got to Zurich two days late and a day into her conference.  So once she had told me her story I did my best to console her and had the horrible task of telling her that because it was a partner airline she would have to talk to them.  Unlike most customers she was cool with this.  So we moved onto her points and status.  Due to all the delays etc none of her points or status credits had gone onto the system and because of all the flight changes they where getting refused by the other airline.  Anyway she gets of the phone with my extension number and I promised her I would get it sorted.  Anyway a couple of emails to a friend at the other airline and after talking with my manager the problem got sorted and I gave her a call back to let her know that the points where on and she was now a Platinum member. (That's as high as you can go).  Understandably she was happy and thanked me etc etc.  Anyway I was happy I could help but got back to my job.  About 2 or 3 days later my TL came over and wanted to speak to me.  Turns out this lady had called my TL my Manager and emailed the Customer relations department of the airline to tell them how wonderful I'd been.

So their possibly my too best memories.  What have customers done for you that have shocked you or just made your day a little or a lot better.

TL;DR Customers who made my day.

Edit.  Yes I know my spelling and grammar aren't that good.

I asked him for his zip code, to see if he was already in the computer. ""Whuh?"" he asked. (Yes, that is literally how he sounded.) Now, a lot of our customers are elderly and hard-of-hearing, so I repeated my request more loudly and slowly. ""Whuh?"" ""YOUR! ZIP! CODE!"" Then he asked me ""Whuss that?"" Now, this guy wasn't from a foreign country, he was from the US...West Virginia to be exact. I can understand people who just moved somewhere and haven't memorized their zip code yet, or people from foreign countries who don't have zip codes, but...this? *Are you serious?!* I thought. I had to explain *several times* what a zip code is. ""SIR, IT'S THE LAST FIVE NUMBERS AFTER YOUR ADDRESS!"" ""Whuh?"" (Rinse and repeat.) When he finally figured it out, I was able to place his order, but that was frustrating as hell.

I work in a call center offering credit card upgrades (we call existing customers to offer a platinum card). This is the is type of job where you have to have some thick skin. Especially today.. 

The call I got today started out like any normal call, we call them, get them to verify the last for digits of the number we called (for privacy reasons, you see). Initially he was tentative about the whole thing (cause of scams and whatnot). I reassure him, he confirms, we move on. Straight off the bat he's not interested, of course. So I handle all his objections, showing value and whatnot, and he finally agrees. All is well, typical call. So we get to the account verification process. We ask the customer to verify his name, phone number, address and dob. Once again he's tentative about the whole thing, this time it takes a bit more convincing on my part but we chug through it.

Then the disclosure. Oh how I love the disclosure. Nothing too fancy about it, just says interest rates/fees and whatnot, takes a couple minutes to read through cause we have to read verbatim. When we get to this part, all of the sudden the customer has to go. Oh, but it'll take literally two minutes to read through this, max, because I can go fairly quickly. ""ok"" he says. 

So I blow through it as fast as possible to get him on his way. Good? No, apparently not. This guy calmly asks my name, which I oblige. He then proceed to go absolute ape-shit. ""fuck you mothetfucker, cancel all this fucking shit"" and so on and so forth for about 5 minutes, screaming at me to shut up and hang up and all this shit. And I have no idea why. 

It was quite an interesting end to a seemingly normal call. I had to stifle laughter a few times because of how much he was yelling. Quite entertaining for sure.

""Yeah, it's already started over here."" She said.

I made a sympathetic sound before saying, ""And you called for your account balance... Your available balance is-""

*HONK!!!*

""WATCH WHERE THE FUCK YOU'RE GOING, IT'S RAINING!""

I gave her the pertinent information, despite my suddenly dry mouth, and brought the call to a close. I took no joy in the realization that it was time to clock out. Not only was I going to have to drive home during a storm, but I was going to have to do it while sharing the road with this idiot.

I worked as an inbound collection agent for a major bank who handles many different credit cards. Mind you we didn't call anyone, they called us to work out how to fix their issues, we were glorified account therapists. There were actual bank named cards, bank credit lines, and my department, which included retail and gas cards. We received all kinds of greatforthissub calls, but this one stuck out to me the most, and had my (imo) best response. 

When our phone beeped, our opening script was 'thank you for calling [redacted], my name is TOAFKA, may I have your account # please'. After receiving said account #, we HAD TO ask them their name and to verify the social security number on the account. We could take the last 4 of the social, but were trained to try to get the whole thing as the highest level of security. Mind you the account takes a little bit to load, so I am generally staring at a loading screen when they verify. So I get the beep, get the account number, ask the name, and as the account is pulling up, ask for the social. Dude LOSES HIS MIND in my ear. Account finally loads, its a church in the south's gas card account, and in big bold letters is a note to not ask for the social. Dammit. Preacher man bellows in my ear for a good 5 minutes, I can't get a word in edgewise. When he finally pauses for breath, I apologize and say never mind, noticed the note, we can verify address and phone number and work on his issue. He nopes that idea, instead launching into more ranting, with cursing included. This goes on for a bit, I actually muted my mic and continued my crossword puzzle, until he runs out of breath again. He then requests a manager. To get a manager, I actually have to put them on hold, dial another number, explain the situation, then transfer when the manager is ready. So I inform him it'll just be a second, switch over and dial a manager, explain whats up, manager says go ahead and transfer.

At **business** it was possible to be on the radio, on 2-3 landline phones, and sending texts to your drivers all at the same time. So of course multi-tasking was a requirement.

For the **company** we would dispatch a tow truck to someone with need. All they had to do was call in for Road Service. The customer pays annually for this, and can purchase different service packages depending on what they want to spend. What we paid these drivers at the time was a pittance. $12.50 for the stop, $2.50 a mile after the first 3, $15.00 to unlock a car door (which typically we called a locksmith for instead of a tow truck), $12.50 for a jump start.... you get the idea.

**My day from hell**

Don't get me wrong, I loved this job, I was helping people, I was fresh out of HS and making more money than my friends. I worked Holidays, but double time and a half is some nice money when you're making what I was. I also got **fantastic** perks from just working for the company. Tickets to Universal, tickets to any number of dinner theaters, tickets to Busch Gardens, you get the idea. This was either 1998-1999.

One day my bosses supervisor came over to me and told me about a call that was going to require *special handling*. 

Oh Boy..

She explains to me that one of our customers is calling to have his car towed to the junk yard. The special circumstances came in to play when he detailed what was wrong with the car. His wife had comitted suicide in the car.

**A WEEK PRIOR.... IN FLORIDA, DURING THE SUMMER**

The manager calmly explained to me that none of this data was to go out on the airwaves (since you never knew who was listening) so I had to get on the air and ask my drivers to call me on the landline. The mans wife had shot herself in the head while sitting in the passenger seat of the car. CSI and local police had done everything that they needed to with the car, but now this man (understandably) just wanted to be rid of it.

*Company* had to pay the driver $50 extra to handle the job, and buy dropcloths (plastic or wet protectant fabric you put down when painting to protect your carpet/floor/furniture) for him to sit on. This wasn't just a case where you could reach into the car and drop it into neutral to get it out of the garage. It was a RWD vehicle and parked nose-in to the garage, less than 6 inches from the wall.

Our policy at the time regarding RWD was we needed a flatbed in order to not damage the car. There are/were tow-trucks that could only pickup the front end of a car, and in this case they could not be used. The driver (the only guy who would take the call mind you) also did not have access to some of the niftier toys available these days, wheel dollies, etc.

Once he got to the scene, he said he could smell the car down the driveway.

Keep in mind, CSI and the like did not clean anything up, except to remove the poor womans corpse. So anything she left behind (by splattering it all over the inside of the car) stayed in the car. For a week. In Florida. During summer.

In the end we got it towed, and the driver got paid fuck-all for what he had to put up with.

Having owned a debit card since I was 14 and having seen pre-authorizations on cards EVERY SINGLE DAY, I like to think that I at least have a basic understanding of how they work.

Today, around 2pm I get a call from a member who has a Chevron rep on the line. The member verifies her information and explains what's going on. From there the rep takes over the call. Keep in mind the member is on the line the entire time, listening.

**Chevron Rep:** I see your member has a charge for $126 on her account. That is a hold your bank has done, not us.

**Me:** No ma'am. That is a legitimate debit that your company had told us is owed. In order to have that released, your company has to fax over a ""release of authorization"" form that states that your company has no intention of claiming those funds.

**CR:** No, what that $126 is called is a pre-authorization. It's something we do to make sure the account is open and has enough funds to cover the purchase. That is not an actual charge.

**Me:** I understand that, ma'am. I see pre-auths every day, usually for $75-$100. There has been some sort of miscommunication between our systems saying that this is to be run as an actual debit. Therefore, you need to fax over the ""release of authorization"" form. Until then, we can not reverse this debit.

**CR:** What seems to be happening, and we've have this issue with banks sometimes, is that you haven't updated your systems and you are now out of compliance with regulation. Your bank needs to make an update.

(The debit cards run through VISA, I'm pretty fucking sure we are in compliance.)

**Me:** Unfortunately, this is an issue on your end. Our system has received information saying this is an owed amount. We do not randomly place a hold on $126 when a member buys gas. This should not be reflecting on the members end if it is being processed as a pre-auth.

**CR:** I'm not sure how much clearer I can be. I guess I'm just used to speaking with someone with a little more experience with how a pre-authorization works.

**Me:** (letting out a little laugh) Well, if you like to speak to a supervisor who can confirm what I just told you, I can certainly get you to someone with ""a little more experience.""

**CR:** Thank you.

I transfer the call to a supervisor, who does confirm that what I'm saying is true; this is an issue that is coming from them. We are basically just the messenger. He takes the call and I ask him to keep me updated. He sends me an IM about 20 minutes later saying the he confirmed with the Chevron rep that I was correct and that this not something that we were doing. Instead of playing the blame game he assured the member that we do place holds like this and gave her a provisional credit for the $126.

6 hours later an email from corporate office saying that there is an ongoing issue with Chevron debiting members' accounts for the pre-authorization amount as well as two other major gas companies and that we are to explain to the member that the money will be returned to them as soon as the issue gets remedied. We are to be aware that this is not an issue with VISA or with our systems.

What are some of your favorite hold music songs? Do you have some good memories associated with some? 

I would link my favorite if I knew where the heck on the internet to find it. It has a good buildup...",,False,self,t5_2urem,False,,,True,t3_16wq1h,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/16wq1h/hold_music/,

I'm sure most of it is exaggerated when you write it out but I don't get it. In most of the stories I see the rep is always usually being very rude (whether subtly or openly) and a lot of times terminate calls on the customer themselves. When I worked for an ATT call center if I was as rude as some of you or terminated calls from my end I would have been fired in less than a week.

If your average customer is an idiot. Than your average banker was dropped on their head once for every year of their life and is also an idiot. 


This particular tale does not do justice to the ineptitude of most of the bankers that I have the pleasure of speaking to 40 hours a week. Nevertheless it is one of my biggest peeves with these people. 


Conversations go like this:

""Where do I get the customer to sign?""
*""The customer is going to sign line B.""*
""OK the customer is going to sign line B?""....""Are you sure?""

Don't freaking ask me twice! I just answered your question. And don't ask if I'm sure. You're the one that doesn't know!


Another example.

""Hi I have a customer coming into the branch at 5pm and I was just wondering how long this process is going to take?""
*""The process usually takes about 20-30 minutes.""*
""OK, so I am going to do this and it will take about 20-30 minutes?""


I've obviously made my descriptions vague but you should get the idea. 
To combat this speech style I've developed the silent treatment. 
When a banker repeats the answer back to me with an obvious question mark behind it. 

They get **Silence** until they get the message. 


If a banker repeats the information back to me by rearranging the words and than putting a question mark behind their redundancy. 

They get **Silence** until they get the message.
