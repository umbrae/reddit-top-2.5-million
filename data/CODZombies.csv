So I've been playing Zombies hardcore for about two years now, and I've always felt a certain attraction to No Man's Land  on Moon. There's just something about the endless chaos that really appeals to me. I mean, people are STILL figuring out new ways to sneak in a few extra kills—a few awesome players by the names of [IISteveII](http://www.youtube.com/user/IlSteveIl/featured), [Alvar1toOwNz](http://www.youtube.com/user/aLvaR1toOwNz/featured), and [MatoMaster21](http://www.youtube.com/user/MatoMaster21/featured) have been deadlocked in an awesome tug of war match to claim the No Man's Land world record in the past few weeks. Check out their awesome videos if you haven't already!

At any rate, I'd like to know what you guys think of NML. What's your highest kill count? Mine is 349. Nowhere close to the record of 380 currently held by Mato, but I've worked hard for it lol. It's really tough to get—it's literally taken me a year of practice. If someone wants to learn the ways of No Man's Land, I'd be happy to break down a game for this awesome subreddit and post it to my Youtube. Okay.

1366324428.0,126,self.CODZombies,1cmzmw,Someone needs to say it. The campaign team did Zombies right with MotD. (Spoilers),146,20,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1cmzmw/someone_needs_to_say_it_the_campaign_team_did/,"They made a very unique thing here.

Let me start with the Easter Egg. It's a moderate difficulty. Enough to where it isn't too easy but not too hard to where casual players could not complete it. The best thing they did with it, however, is making it so that you don't need four damn players to complete it. You can complete it with two. The reason that this is a good thing, and also the reason that makes this EE better than the other two, is that people don't always have three others who can play at the same time, want to complete the EE, have the map, etc. It allows you to just grab someone that you KNOW can and wants to do the EE, and just do it! And the fact that they made it an EE that actually *ends the game* is just awesome, as well as unique, as no other EE has done so before.

Now, the map in general, is simply stunning. It's eerie, creepy, and the largest to date. The traps are unique, and simply awesome. (Personally, I *love* the Sniper Tower.) The box has had a complete redesign, which fits the atmosphere of the map perfectly. They added a new perk, Electric Cherry. that works perfectly in conjunction with an already existing perk, Speed Cola. The zombies are unlike the others we have seen, they seem to be far more terrifying. The inclusion of the Afterlife Mode has given a new spin on zombies, in a multitude of ways. It is necessary in order to live in the higher rounds, since you need to power up the perk machines with it. To survive, you must die, in a sense. It's pretty awesome.

They also redesigned the HUD, giving it a new look, which I think fits well with the map. They added the name of the character you're playing as next to your points. While that is not really too big of a thing, I find it kinda neat.

All in all, I think that the zombies team can learn from what the campaign team did here, *especially* with the Easter Egg.

Edit: Typos.

**IMPORTANT EDIT:** Mob of the Dead was made by the campaign team. The zombies team had little impact on it at all. The reason for this is that they wanted to focus on the next map.

###Confirmed Persistent Perks

**************
| Perk  | Description   | How to Lose     |    | 
|:-----------|:------------|:------------:|:-----------:|
| **Faster Revive**|    The player can earn faster revives (revives are twice as fast) by reviving downed allies 2-17 times in one game. The effect can be stacked with Quick Revive.      |     To lose it, the player must try and fail to revive a downed person, even if said person is later revived. Even an accidental fail (such as being knocked out of the way) will cause the upgrade to be lost.     | [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZmOVdT2kx4)
| **More Headshot Damage**  |    The player can earn increased headshot damage by getting an arbitrary amount of collateral headshots (multiple headshot kills with 1 bullet). In addition to increased headshot damage, shooting a zombie anywhere will make its head pop, although this effect is aesthetic. Sometimes the green flash will show in Survival on any of the survival maps, though the persistent upgrade will not be applied.     |  To lose it, the player must kill 25-75 zombies in a row without a headshot.   |  [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzsD1nZmzdk)
| **Stronger Barriers**       |        The player can earn stronger barriers to be built on windows by repairing 250 barriers in one game. The barriers are partially made of steel and screwed in, so it will take more time for them to be taken down.|   To lose it, the player must fail to build a single barrier in a round. | [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MTWKUI1viw)
| **Jugg+**        |          This perk effectively doubles the player's health, with a down resulting after 4 hits instead of 2. The effect stacks with Juggernog, allowing the player to have a maximum of 300% health. To obtain it, the player must let himself be downed without Quick Revive, and thereby end the game, about 3 times.|     To lose it, the player must die on or after round fifteen while teammates are still alive. |[Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u45M6nKppkk)
| **Super Insta-Kill**  |    The player can earn a subversion of Insta-Kill by not killing a single zombie during an Insta-Kill, twice in a row. The effect lasts 15 seconds, is activated when an Insta-Kill is obtained and allows the player to simply walk into a zombie to kill it. Killing a zombie using it will only give 50 points.|  To lose it, the player must be damaged by a zombie during the Insta-Kill (with the exception of a flaming zombie exploding).| [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhbeDWGb1UY)   
| **Cash Back**       |        The player can earn an upgrade to give 1000 points every time when going prone in front of a Perk-a-Cola machine after buying said perk. This ability is obtained by going in front of the machine a random amount of times after buying it. |   To lose it, the player must not go prone in front of a Perk-a-Cola machine after buying it. | [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzsAREGqEpw)
| **PhD Flopper**        |          This perk is achieved when the player takes a certain amount of fall damage 5-10 times. When achieved, the player will not take any splash damage or fall damage (only if they dolphin dive off of the edge). This perk is only available on Buried. |     To lose it, the player must take fall damage by falling with out dolphin diving.| [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wU1TslHQmM)
| **Mystery Box Perk**  |    This perk is achieved when the player gets a lot of ""bad"" weapons from the Mystery Box. At that point the player will see a glow and a teddy bear appears on the box. The player is then on granted a higher likelihood of receiving better weapons from the mystery box. ""Bad"" weapons include, the Ballistic Knife, Executioner, FAL, SMR, Barrett M82A1, War Machine, M8A1. |  This Perk is automatically lost at the start of round 10 or when too many good weapons are given from the box.   | [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg3c7HBCmCw)
| **Half-Off**       |        This Perk is achieved when the player gets 3000 or more points during a Double Points Power-Up. It reduces all purchase costs by half during a Double Points Power-Up. If the player does not have enough money to purchase the item even with half-off, it may take an even smaller amount. This upgrade is unrelated to the x2 Points upgrade. This Perk is automatically lost at the end of the next Double Points|   This Perk is automatically lost at the end of the next Double Points | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1w8CHF-Mg)
| **Tombstone**       |          Purchase 4 perks in one round. This Perk allows the player to retain all perks except Quick Revive after being downed and revived by Quick Revive. In a game with two or more players, the player will retain all of their perks except for their last obtained perk. |     This Perk is automatically lost at the end of the game. | [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqmc1SVTJEI)
| **Extra Sniper Points**  |    Get 10 kills at long distance with the sniper rifle. Once the perk is obtained each sniper kill will give you additional points. |  This perk can be lost by getting kills with a gun other than the sniper rifle.  | [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsnCwyHXSqI)
| **Extra Pistol Points**  |    Shoot and miss with your pistols until your accuracy is extremely low. Once the perk is obtained each pistol shot will give you double points. |  This perk can be lost by increasing your pistol accuracy.  | [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovR8f963cew)

Here is a full written guide on how to tackle the obstacles in Richtofen's side of the Easter Egg on Buried. I will update it with pictures and extra information over time. If any of my information is incorrect, please post a comment with evidence and I will revise it! Comment any questions or additional information as well!


**NOTES BEFORE STARTING:**

* It is highly recommended to start the Easter Egg on either Round 1 or 2, leaving a final zombie. Round 1 or 2 leaves the last zombie as a slow walker. In the further parts of the Easter Egg, you may need to progress through the Easter egg by starting new rounds. By starting the easter egg on a low round, it makes it easier for you to complete the Easter Egg. 

* Players may need a good amount of money in the bank (maybe 25,000 each for comfort). You will need to open almost all doors, get perks, and spend money on the box to get the desired weapons.

* A team of 4 is needed. No less.

* In terms of weaponry, you will need one of the Time Bomb, Paralyzer, and Galvaknuckles/Bowie Knife.

* You can get a free perk from the ghost lady by going into her house and killing her off when you see lights in the windows of the Mansion

* Perks highly recommended for this Easter Egg include Staminup and Vulture Aid

**1) Build the Guillotine (4 Parts)**

The first step is to build the guillotine located in the dark alleyway beside the Saloon. In order to do Richtofen's side of the Easter Egg, be sure NOT to build Maxis' gallows/hanging noose. 

* Satellite Dish found on top of Saloon
* Thin satellite in the first floor of the Barn
* Pink Crystal found in the upper tunnels across the part
* Spool of Wire/Wool found in the Gunsmith beside the little iron oven

**2) Charge the Red Orbs using the Paralyzer Wonder Weapon**

Shoot your paralyzer at the red orbs and hold until you see them completely change colour and make a noise. It should not take more than 5 seconds per orb. 

* Orb in the alleyway beside the Saloon
* Orb beside the Church
* Orb in the upper tunnels
* Orb in the garden before entering the maze. It's close to the entrance when you head back into the mansion from the maze

**3) Knock down the Floating Purple Lantern**

A floating purple lantern will appear around the church/mansion area. It will continue to float around the town until it is knocked down. You can knock it down by properly timing a frag grenade and letting it explode near the lantern. Pick up the lantern by running over it. Once you pick it up you cannot drop it and give it to another person.

Note: If the lantern is dropped on a place where you cannot reach it, it will disappear after a while and respawn. Do not worry!

**4) Charge the Lantern**

Go into the mansion and kill witches to 'charge the lantern.' Every player will hear chimes after each kill. 8 or so kills should be enough to charge the lantern. An audio cue will be given/chimes will stop ringing once the lantern is fully charged.

**5) Place the Lantern**

If the lantern is fully charged, a glowing purple lantern symbol will appear on the rooftop of the Gunsmith. You can't miss it. Jump there from the Saloon/Bank rooftop and place it down on the spot. 

**6) The Cipher**

A cipher/code will appear on the wall next to the glowing purple lantern symbol after the lantern is placed. Deciphering the code will reveal the order of wooden signs (located in the tunnels) you need to hit on the next step. There are 3 rows of code. Each row indicats a different wooden sign. The order of signs is different for every game so you will need to learn how to decode at least the first letter of each sign or get a picture to compare with. [Someone else made a great video teaching you how to decode this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1hoxua/how_to_decode_the_symbols_on_buried/) ***DO NOT HIT THE SIGNS YET***.

The signs include:

- Dry Gulch Shaft 

- Lunger Undermines

- Ground Biter Pits

- Bone... (forgot the next bit)

- Corro... (forgot the next bit)

Realistically, you only need to decipher the first letter of each sign to know which ones to hit.

**7) IMPORTANT! Placing the Time Bomb**

After uncovering the cipher and before hitting the signs, a player needs to place down a Time Bomb on the Guillotine. Make sure this is done. 

**8) The Orb Chase/Hitting the Signs**

Before starting this step, Vulture Aid is necessary for all players for easiest completion. Staminup is recommended but not needed. Opening all the main doors and barricades with the giant is also recommended.

One player needs the Galvaknuckles OR Bowie Knife and needs to head up into the tunnels knowing the correct order of signs to hit, uncovered from the cipher. You need to punch/knife the three signs in the correct order. There is no time constraint. Once the third and final sign is punched, a blue orb of energy with 5 balls flying around it will pop out. This blue orb of energy will disappear after a short period of time. To keep it going, you simply need to run over and touch the blue orb. However, after touching the orb, it will move to a new location. You can only see this orb through the map if you have Vulture Aid. Here is how you complete this step:

* Position your teammates throughout the map with one person up in the tunnels to hit the signs
* Once the 3rd and final sign is hit, touch the orb
* Have the person closest to the orb's new position touch it and be sure to call it out
* The orb will then move to a new position. Have the person closest to the orb's new position touch it again
* You need to touch the orb about 6 or 7 times in order for this step to be complete
* The orb will, in it's last position, be at the guillotine. Once it has reached there you have completed this step.

**9) Charging the Crystal**

Once the orb has reached it's final spot at the guillotine, you need to kill zombies near the guillotine. If you have vulture aid, you will be able to notice that some zombies that come near the guillotine have glowing hands. Kill those zombies to gain souls for the crystal. You need five 'souls' to fully charge it. If you are on a low round, like I recommended, this will be easy.

**10) Going back in Time/Infinity Mode**

Once the Crystal has 5 glowing orbs flying around it, have everyone come very close to the guillotine. Once everyone is at the guillotine, activate the time bomb that we placed in Step 7. You will then be sent into Infinity Mode. Be sure, however, to **read the next step** before activating the time bomb.

**11) Infinity Mode and Finding the Switch**

NOTE: In Infinity Mode, zombies are immune to your attacks. They can die to the giant + candy and buildable tools like the trample steam. After a short period of time in Infinity Mode, you will be sent back to your time.

In Infinity Mode, scattered around the map OUTSIDE (not inside buildings) you will find the bodies of your 4 playable characters. You need your entire team looking around the map for these bodies. Once you find a body, search it by holding X. You will see a progress bar while you are searching. You are looking for a switch. If there is nothing on the body, a little text will appear at the top of everyone's game saying ""There is nothing here..."" or something like that. When the switch is found on one of four bodies, rejoice and celebrate! 

Note: If the player who found the switch is downed in Infinity Mode, he will also drop the switch. However, you will still be able to pick it up in your normal time. Just look around for the switch on the ground somewhere.

**If you cannot find the switch in time:** Start up a new round and look for a Max Ammo to refuel your time bombs. You can just use another time bomb on a guillotine at any round/time to be sent back into Infinity Mode to try again.

**12) Add the switch to the Guillotine**

Add the switch to the guillotine. I don't think you have to pull it but pull it if the option allows.

**13) The Maze and Coloured Levers**

In the maze, those green doors will now have levers on them. There should be 4 doors with 4 different colours: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow. You will need to hit these levers in the correct order to move onto the next step. Doing this step requires a small degree of trial and error because the order changes for each game. Here is how to complete this step:

* Find all four doors and have each person stand at a different coloured lever
* Make sure someone is ready to write down the order and make notes as you go along
* Hit the levers in any order, but be sure to write it down. We will use 1) RED 2) YELLOW 3) GREEN 4) BLUE as an example.
* Once the last lever is pulled, look for a spark from the levers. If none of them spark, change the order completely and have different colours pulled in a different order. However, if one of them sparks, make a note of which colour it was and if it was pulled 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.
* In our example, if 2) YELLOW sparked, we know that YELLOW being pulled 2nd is correct. Therefore, when we try a different order, we keep YELLOW pulled second and change up the other ones.
* Head through the mansion and back into the maze again to reset the levers. Continue changing up the order and look for sparks to get the correct order.
* Once the correct order is found, Richtofen will say some stuff and you can head back to the town

**13) Make a Wish**

Go to the fountain in front of the mansion (in the town) to make a wish. You will be able to press X by the fountain. It should not matter if the fountain is broken or still in one piece. 

**14) 'Sharpshooter' Firing at the Targets**

A bunch of targets will then pop out around the map. They should appear in 4 locations: In Front of Courtroom, Inside the Saloon, in the Mansion windows, and by the Jail. Position your teammates around by these locations and fire at the targets. Make sure to hit them all as quickly as possible because you are on a time constraint. You should be able to start again by making another wish.

* Take a break to just make a wish and look at your targets. Make sure you don't have a target that you are missing every single time.
* I recommend using the PDW with an M16 as your secondary. When your PDW is low on ammo, find a good time to switch weapons and take that opportunity.
* I also recommend getting a crawler and using Candy near that crawler to make the giant pick it up. For this, it's almost essential.

**15) Achievement Unlocked**

After successfully hitting all the signs, you should unlock the achievement. As for the rest of the Easter Egg with Richtofen, my team and I will be heading back and doing it over again to get some good footage and get to the actual ending which we have not gotten to yet.",,False,self,t5_2sal9,1373177927.0,,,True,t3_1hnewb,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1hnewb/buried_spoilers_detailed_full_written_guide_on/,

Here is a video of the current standing world record:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vkh22YP32Hs

For those who can't view the link, a youtuber named ""LegitGaming360"" reached round 2150 on Shi No Numa. This is what I will try to beat. I want to have good leverage to retain my record, so I will aim for round 2500.

My gamertag is Vuoy (xbox). If you want to send me a message when I'm online, you can ask what round I'm on, plain cheer me on, etc. If I am offline, I set my status offline, because I have the game paused for extended amounts of time. (Eating, sleeping, busy, etc.)

I will be recording major rounds, (1, 50, 100, 150, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2250, and 2500!) as video proof to display my record. I use an Elegato, so thankfully it's good quality.

The video will be uploaded to:

2. Verruckt
3. Shi No Numa
4. Der Riese
5. Kino Der Toten
6. Five
7. Ascension
8. Call of the Dead
9. Shangri La
10. Moon
and
11. Brand New Zombie Map!

And hey if they want to round it to a multiple of 5 (because all map packs usually have 5 maps (multiplayer/zombies)) then they can give us 4 new zombie maps idk but the big idea is bringing back all of those old zombie maps maybe even with WaW/Black ops guns.

Just an idea, what do you think about this?

1354745370.0,88,self.CODZombies,14chy7,I know exactly how the Zombie Ranking System works.  Details inside!,97,9,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/14chy7/i_know_exactly_how_the_zombie_ranking_system/,"Below is a detailed explanation of how the ranking system for zombies works.  It's quite long, and I provide what I believe is sufficient evidence from zombie matches that support my claims.  As far as I know, the majority of my findings are new.  

**Claim 1:  Ranks are based on a percentage system**

This claim is the most well known, and is nothing new.  I am only mentioning it in case you haven't heard of it yet.  This claim basically says that only so many people can have a specific rank.  For example, perhaps only the top 10% of zombie plays can have the skull with the shotgun.  The top 20% can only have a skull with a dagger (these numbers are completely arbitrary).  

__*Evidence*:  Many players have reported a lowering of their rank from not playing zombies.  The reason for this is that when you don't play for a while, other players surpass your rank, and thus push you down.  

**Claim 2:  The dashes are completely independent of the symbols**

In other words, the dashes that appear next to your zombie rank symbol does not affect the change in your symbol, and vice versa.  This also means that a player must not necessarily obtain the blue eyes in order to progress to the next symbol.  

__*Evidence*:  Many players have moved from one symbol to another without a change in the number of dashes.  Here's an example: Lets say that you have a regular skull with three dashes.  It is possible to become a skull with a dagger while retaining the three dashes.  This has actually happened to me yesterday while I was testing theories.  

__*Side note:  This may be quite obvious to many people, but I find it worth mentioning.  The blue eyes only appear at 5 dashes.  

**Claim 3:  The symbol that you have is completely based on the sum of your rounds**

This was one of my great discoveries yesterday.  The symbol that you have (skull, dagger, shotgun, etc) depends on the total amount of rounds that you have on the leaderboards.  For example, lets say that you only play town survival.  Your records on the leaderboards are 13, 20, 10, and 24 for 1 player, 2 players, 3 players and 4 players respectively.  The summation of these numbers yields 67, so your total round number is 67.  You need a certain total round number for each rank, and remember, this number is variable.  The number changes because the ranking system is based on percentages.  

__*Evidence*:  I have tested this theory by playing on two and three player modes (I held a record of 0 on each) for different maps.  I literally jumped from the skull to the dagger in 2 short games.  This cannot be based off of kills, deaths, revives, etc, because the short matches I played  had insignificant effects on these parameters.  The only significant change was the total round number, therefore I feel it safe to conclude claim 3.  

**Claim 4:  The number of dashes that you have is based off of the other parameters, such as kills, deaths, revives, accuracy, etc**

__*Evidence*: This one is a given.  I had multiple matches in which I attempted to maximize the amount of times that I died, and minimized my revives and kills.  Consequently, I moved from 5 dashes to 3 quite rapidly.  I then did the complete opposite, and as expected, I regained my dashes.  The exact relationship is still unknown however.  But I believe that the amount of dashes is based on ratios rather than the shear number of each parameter.  

These are all of my claims.  I have more supporting evidence for a couple of these, however, I find it unnecessary to provide unless by request.  I believe the evidence I have supplied adequately supports my claims.  If you have any questions, comments, or contradictory events to report, please leave a comment.  

*Note:  If I can obtain enough data, I can perform a statistical analysis in order to obtain a multiple linear regression equation for the contributions of individual parameters.  This equation would allow you to plug in your corresponding kills, revives, downs, etc, and calculate what your rank should be.  This could prove to be useful in predicting necessary requirements for ranking up.  I will need at least 100 trials, with the corresponding number of dashes that you have.  

**TL;DR:  READ EVERYTHING IN BOLD**

***Edit***:  As one redditor pointed out, my title is a bit misleading.  I am actually pretty new to posting on reddit, so I don't know how to change the title.  Does a mod have to do it for me?

He sourced these ""file names"" as the sources for his info. We had our suspicions about the legitimacy of his ""find"" almost immediately. We didn't act on our suspicions however until several days later when we discovered, on the day before release, that Modio can not browse 360 files, and that even if it could, no MotD files were included in the patch. We removed the false information shortly after, but it had already been up on the wiki for over a week at that point, so the damage had been done.

There were a lot of reasons why our response was slow, one of the main ones being that we felt this user was trusted enough not to lie about what he told us. His lie betrayed our trust, and spread false information to our users.

I've seen this point brought up in several threads on this subreddit, and would just like to make it clear that we apologize for the false information. We strive to prevent this sort of thing from happening. We have several policies in place that are meant to prevent this sort of thing, and we still failed to pick up on this.

###Confirmed Persistent Perks

**************
| Perk  | Description   | How to Lose     |    | 
|:-----------|:------------|:------------:|:-----------:|
| **Faster Revive**|    The player can earn faster revives (revives are twice as fast) by reviving downed allies 2-17 times in one game. The effect can be stacked with Quick Revive.      |     To lose it, the player must try and fail to revive a downed person, even if said person is later revived. Even an accidental fail (such as being knocked out of the way) will cause the upgrade to be lost.     | [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZmOVdT2kx4)
| **More Headshot Damage**  |    The player can earn increased headshot damage by getting an arbitrary amount of collateral headshots (multiple headshot kills with 1 bullet). In addition to increased headshot damage, shooting a zombie anywhere will make its head pop, although this effect is aesthetic. Sometimes the green flash will show in Survival on any of the survival maps, though the persistent upgrade will not be applied.     |  To lose it, the player must kill 25-75 zombies in a row without a headshot.   |  [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzsD1nZmzdk)
| **Stronger Barriers**       |        The player can earn stronger barriers to be built on windows by repairing 250 barriers in one game. The barriers are partially made of steel and screwed in, so it will take more time for them to be taken down.|   To lose it, the player must fail to build a single barrier in a round. | [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MTWKUI1viw)
| **Jugg+**        |          This perk effectively doubles the player's health, with a down resulting after 4 hits instead of 2. The effect stacks with Juggernog, allowing the player to have a maximum of 300% health. To obtain it, the player must let himself be downed without Quick Revive, and thereby end the game, about 3 times.|     To lose it, the player must die on or after round fifteen while teammates are still alive. |[Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u45M6nKppkk)
| **Super Insta-Kill**  |    The player can earn a subversion of Insta-Kill by not killing a single zombie during an Insta-Kill, twice in a row. The effect lasts 15 seconds, is activated when an Insta-Kill is obtained and allows the player to simply walk into a zombie to kill it. Killing a zombie using it will only give 50 points.|  To lose it, the player must be damaged by a zombie during the Insta-Kill (with the exception of a flaming zombie exploding).| [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhbeDWGb1UY)   
| **Cash Back**       |        The player can earn an upgrade to give 1000 points every time when going prone in front of a Perk-a-Cola machine after buying said perk. This ability is obtained by going in front of the machine a random amount of times after buying it. |   To lose it, the player must not go prone in front of a Perk-a-Cola machine after buying it. | [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzsAREGqEpw)
| **PhD Flopper**        |          This perk is achieved when the player takes a certain amount of fall damage 5-10 times. When achieved, the player will not take any splash damage or fall damage (only if they dolphin dive off of the edge). This perk is only available on Buried. |     To lose it, the player must take fall damage by falling with out dolphin diving.| [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wU1TslHQmM)
| **Mystery Box Perk**  |    This perk is achieved when the player gets a lot of ""bad"" weapons from the Mystery Box. At that point the player will see a glow and a teddy bear appears on the box. The player is then on granted a higher likelihood of receiving better weapons from the mystery box. ""Bad"" weapons include, the Ballistic Knife, Executioner, FAL, SMR, Barrett M82A1, War Machine, M8A1. |  This Perk is automatically lost at the start of round 10 or when too many good weapons are given from the box.   | [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg3c7HBCmCw)
| **Half-Off**       |        This perk is achieved when the player picks up a 2x power up and does not gain any points during the entire duration of the power up. the next time the player picks up a 2x power up you will receive the perk. This perk reduces the cost of everything by 50%. This Perk is automatically lost at the end of the next Double Points|   This Perk is automatically lost at the end of the next Double Points | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1w8CHF-Mg)
| **Tombstone**  *under review*       |          There are multiple theories on what it take to obtain this perk.  I will list all of them and please report to me which one has the best success rate.  First way is to buy four perks in one round, second way is to buy four berks before round four and the last one is to buy four perks and then earn three from the mistress and then grab a fourth from her. This Perk allows the player to retain all perks except Quick Revive after being downed and revived by Quick Revive. In a game with two or more players, the player will retain all of their perks except for their last obtained perk. |     It is currently unconfirmed how to lose this perk.  There are reports that being revived with a PaP ballistic knife will make you lose the perk. | [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqmc1SVTJEI)
| **Extra Sniper Points**  |    Get 10 kills at long distance with the sniper rifle. Once the perk is obtained each sniper kill will give you 350 points + per zombie kill, 400 points for a headshot, when you have double points headshots are 500 points.  |  The perk can be lost by missing three sniper shots in a row.  It has also been reported that you can lose this perk from getting close range sniper kills or kills with other weapons.  | [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4VvK0ZQLCI)
| **Extra Pistol Points**  |    Shoot and miss with your pistols until your accuracy is extremely low. Once the perk is obtained each pistol shot will give you double points. |  This perk can be lost by increasing your pistol accuracy.  | [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovR8f963cew)
| **Ray Gun Olympia**                 *under review*  |    There are multiple theories on how to obtain this perk.  One is that any new player(players with one or two bones) will receive the Ray Gun when buying the Olympia, the other being that any player with no tally marks can also receive the Ray Gun when buying the Olympia.  You may need to buy the Olympia and then purchase ammo for it a few times before it appears. |  This perk seems to go away when a player hits round ten but then reappears the following round.  | [Video Theory1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imF1sGcFX18) [Video Theory2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg_iwUpsuhY)

1370329584.0,80,self.CODZombies,1fmzt7,Tower of Babel/DLC Connection Theory,107,27,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1fmzt7/tower_of_babeldlc_connection_theory/,"EDIT2: I want to clarify that I'm not 100% sold on the whole, ""next DLC will be paradise,"" but this is just my best theory to fit that idea. Die Rise threw me for a loop and honestly anything can happen in the next maps and I can't say I'll be completely surprised because well... It's Zombies!

So just like I try to say in my title, these are my ideas/theories on where the next DLC map/story is heading.  There has been a lot of talk about how the next map has a high possibility of being somewhere in *Paradise* due to the ""similar"" patterns of the general style of DLC maps so far (CoTD/MoTD being the biggest example). So speculation as of recently has been, what paradise will be chosen to continue our journey? People seem to want it to be in Atlantis... Which I find highly unlikely (same for Mt. Olympus).  Purely because those seem almost *TOO* out of the ordinary for the COD Zombies canon (I understand that there is a TON of improbable things already in existence within the whole but that is aside from my point). So really, what can we speculate? We have pretty much made our mind up that the best we can guess is that it will be ""paradise-esque,"" but given the past of zombies what are some REALISTIC options that we can choose from?  From what I can gather, it is no surprise that there are hints/teasers/EE of future maps in various zombies maps of the past. I think Moon was one of the one ones teased in a previous map, I really just don't feel like looking into it (I'm sure one of you knows and could inform us all in the comments, thank you). So in BO2 Zombies what paradise like place has been hinted towards to TWICE now with the 2 DLCs AND coincidentally was the name of the major EE of the original BO2 map? You guessed it, The Tower of Babel. Now before you say, ""Really, you think it's gonna be on a spiral tower?? You must ride the short bus..."" I don't think the next DLC map will be located at the ToB. I just think the map will take place right next to it, at the Hanging Gardens of Babylon ;) ---
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon  ---  

There is the Wikipedia link on the hanging gardens of babylon, and in the picture provided it even says, ""with the ToB in the background.""  I know this is a stretch, hell that's why it's a theory, but I honestly feel like it is a legit possibility. Plus how amazing would a map like that be?? Outdoors in a beautiful lush garden *paradise* set in the middle east near the Mediterranean.  And the place is a giant palace, the interior could be an amazing intricate exploration and you never know how high, or low, you could go inside! And since time/space travel are synonymous when the Gardens were actually in use vs. destroyed wouldn't matter. ALSO another tie in is how the ToB is linked to how ""the world split into different languages"" and how the group is split between the voices/MaxisRichtofen and then additionally Sthulinger with his extra headvoice. IDK, I thought for a theory this was a damn plausible one. Let me know what you think.

I looked around and found it [here.](http://imgur.com/g4s3EC2) 

Now I think this is the only other multiplayer map in any COD game to have the book expect the original Nuketown, but I might be wrong. So logic would dictate that Nuketown had the book and it became a Zombies map, so why wouldn't this become one too. Then I decided to look around Nuketown 2025 and found this [there.](http://imgur.com/h25TuiA) 

After I decided to explore both maps more in depth. In Nuketown 2025 [I found the disc that is next to the TV in Nuketown Zombies.](http://imgur.com/BXJOi3g) So I went into Hijack to see if there was anything similar, and [this is what I found.](http://imgur.com/7K9a4P2)
it seems pretty similar considering that the stand looks similar and are both circular with an open center. 

So I could not find anything else in Nuketown except some Alien toys but that's it. So I decided to look around Hijack again and [I found this.](http://imgur.com/Yrl1IEt) It's the Nuketown symbol. Why would Trearch put so much detail into something so small. Are they trying to tell us something? 

Also I saw someone who claimed the next map was in the Bermuda triangle on a ship. Well this map is a ship, but I am not saying that guy description of the map is right, but he might have the right idea.

1.  All four players must stand on the symbols on the top of the elevators at the same time. (The elevators with the the symbols are; the the one on the same wall as the power switch in the power room, the one that is right down the little incline from where the ramp to the tower is on the roof, and if you run up the tower and jump over the two elevators in that room have one.) Once everyone has stepped on them on the same time, they will begin to glow.

2. Next you have to activate the same symbols again, but they are scattered around the map. You  must stand on each one in a specific random order. They will light up if they are stepped on at the right time. The locations are; Right outside the starting room through the door and to the right, by semtex, by the 74u, and by the SVU but down the stairs and to the right. Again you have to step on them in a certain order until they all light up and you hear Richtofen speak. 

1. A player must buy the SVU or any sniper, and shoot the orbs out of the dragon's mouths. They will fly to the starting room and will be under the lions feet. This is where the two different sides split. I will give the Maxis side after Richtofen's.

1. Now a player must get the Sliquifier and start to shoot the balls, they will begin to spin. Once both balls are spinning you can begin the next step. 

1. Next, all four players must get a Tramplesteam.1.  and find the Zombie seals on the ground. All players must place a launcher on the zombie seals, facing the tower. You lead zombies into the tramp, launching them into the tower, Richtofen will keep saying to do more until the tower turns slightly blue.

 1. Next you will have to get Galva Knuckles and punch the towers legs. The order inwich you punch them is random and to find out what the order is, you must use the Majohng tiles. You must find out which direction (north, east, south, west) corresponds with a number tiles (1,2,3,4) by matching the colors. You then punch the legs in that order, and you will unlock the achievement. 



**Maxis**

1. This side starts off with the same 3 steps as Richtofen's.

1. This is wear its different, you must go into the Buddha room (By the AN-94, through the couch and down the halls, its red) And kill zombies, Maxis will say more, more, until eventually he will say enough.

1. Now, this is wear it gets specific. You will need the balistics knife and PAP it; **except the only person that can have it is Stu.** When the player who is Stu has the PAP balistics knife, you go back into the buddha room and **only Russman** has to go down, and Stu has to revive him with the PAP Balistics knife.

1.  Now every player must get a Tramplesteam again, but instead of placing them on the zombie seals, you must put them on the Lion seals. Once agian facing the tower. Now you must go to the starting room and pick up the balls from under the lions. You then place the balls on the launchers, so they get launched back and forth between them. Make sure they crisscross each other in an ""X"".

1.  Finally you do the same last step as the Richtofen, by doing the same method of punching the legs of the tower with the Galva knuckles; this time the tower will be glowing orange.

Also, I hear a lot of people claim Double Tap is a waste of a perk, because it just ""wastes ammo faster"". So I wanted to make this post to clear a few things up, and about why you should get Double Tap more often.

First let me talk about the Original Double Tap. It's only effect was to increase your rate of fire, resulting in players feeling there ammo is disappearing more quickly. Well, that's the point, of course your ammo is going to deplenish quicker if you fire at a higher rate. What people don't seem to understand is that when you shoot faster, you kill faster, thus ensuring a higher chance of survivability.

On to Double Tap 2, this is the perk that appears in Black Ops 2 zombie maps. Like the previous Double Tap, Double Tap 2 increases your fire rate, but slightly less. The main effect is that when you shoot a bullet it is as if you shot two.

Let me elaborate.

You pull the trigger once, two bullets will come out, however it will deplenish only one shot of your ammo count. It basically **doubles your amount of ammo** and **doubles your damage output**. More damage means it takes less shots to kill, less shots to kill means **you save ammo**.

Although, I'm not entirely sure if it works for every gun. I believe the effect of Double Tap 2 only works on guns with bullets, unlike the Ray Gun, or the Mustang and Sally.

Either way, Double Tap 2 is a must, I make sure to grab it ASAP, after juggernog of course.

**TL;DR:** Read all the bold.

Cheers :)

Green Run takes place at the [**Hanford Site**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site). 

The Hanford Site is a mostly decommissioned nuclear production complex on the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington, operated by the United States federal government. Here, they held a project named [**Green Run**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Run) (coincidence? no). The ""Green Run"" was a secret U.S. Government release of radioactive fission products on December 2--3, 1949, at the Hanford Site plutonium production facility.

That's the first clue, the project's name , Green Run, and the Black ops 2 Zombies map, Green Run.

Now, look at [**this**](http://i1168.photobucket.com/albums/r486/TacticalitySquad/7DFE3116-57FB-470E-8007-DCFFF3C56AA7-16838-00000E64E06A22DB.jpg)

I assume you know what this is. The map at Green Run spawn, in the middle of the bus depot. Anyway, study the map you see, look at the river mainly.

 If you visit the Hanford Site on Google Maps (46°38'21.85""N, 119°29'43.55""W (may need to zoom out a little)) you can see- Well, see for yourself.

1359735307.0,65,self.CODZombies,17p75e,"I see this asked daily, so here's a mini guide - Guide for a Newcomer ",71,6,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/17p75e/i_see_this_asked_daily_so_heres_a_mini_guide/,"Hello new Zombies player! This is a guide to help you understand the way zombies works. If you already know a bit about zombies, I'd recommend jumping down a few sections.

     1) Point System

Zombies will spawn all over the place each round and begin coming after you. You get points for killing them. These points are used to buy new guns, perks (will be explained), and new areas to explore while playing. You begin with 500 points each game. You get 10 points for a ""hitmarker,"" 50 points for a kill by explosives (Grenades, Claymores, Rocket Launchers, Ray Gun, etc.), 60 points for a kill by a normal gun. However, that 60 becomes 100 with a headshot, and the 60 becomes 130 if you melee the zombie to death (with a knife or the Galvaknuckles). Weapons cost anywhere between 500 and 1250 points, and doors cost anywhere between 750 and 1250 points. However, survival comes first. Surviving is more important, and the key to surviving is in movement.

     2) Movement

For the first few rounds, zombies will walk. They will begin to sprint after the rounds go on. Eventually, all zombies will sprint. However, with explosives, you can blow a zombies leg/legs off and make it so they can only crawl - this significantly reduces their speed and danger. Zombies can easily be tricked by your movements. The easiest way to play is to loop all the zombies together by running them in lines, then turning and unloading on them (this is called ""training""). For an example of this, check out some of TheSyndicateProject's gameplay videos on Youtube, and you will understand it. However, no matter what you do, there are three ""No's"" for movement. No Corners, No Stopping, and No Wall-Running. Zombies will easily trap you and kill you in corners. Zombies can surround you, so to avoid this, don't stop moving. No wall running merely means not to move along a wall for too long as zombies will be able to trap you extremely easily. Stick to open corridors and keep moving. 

     3) Guns

Guns are ready to buy on walls in almost every room. There are SMG's, Pistols, Shotguns, Assault Rifles, Snipers, and even special weapons (grenades and guns). Special Guns are guns like the Ballistic Knife, Crossbow, and Ray Gun. However, most of these are only available through something called the ""Random Weapon Box."" This Box allows you to open it for 950 points, and it will randomly give you a gun - it is your choice whether you take it or not. It can be used as many times as you like, but the box may move to another Box Spawn location - this is indicated by a teddy bear appearing instead of a gun. Wall guns are generally not as strong, but they have a ready stream of ammo - the most important part of the game. Ammo is your key to survival, so be smart about conserving it. If you have a lot of points and you are running low on ammo, you can find the map's Pack-a-Punch machine (however not all maps have this). It will upgrade your gun for 5000 points, drastically increasing damage, adding ammo, and adding something else special onto the gun (this changes depending on the gun). Pack-a-Punching a gun will give it full ammo, so use your normal ammo wisely- if you have enough to Pack-a-Punch, unload your weapon on the zombies! 

     4) Perk-a-Colas (Perks)
 
Perks are available in several locations on almost every map. These perks and their powers are listed in the sidebar. However, Juggernog is your best friend. It costs 2500 points. This should always be the second thing you buy, the first being a gun. Juggernog will allow you to take 5 hits as opposed to 2 before dying. This is extremely useful. The other perks speed up your reload, speed up your rate of fire, etc. Perks are a big part of the puzzle that is Call of Duty: Zombies. (IF SOMEBODY COULD WRITE UP A PERMA-PERK EXPLANATION THAT'D BE GREEEAT.)

     5) Drops

Drops are randomly given for killing zombies. These include Insta-Kill, Double Points, Max Ammo, Fire Sale, Death Machine, Carpenter, and Nuke. They drop from dead zombies and are gold with a green glow. Make sure to run through them in order to get them, or they'll disappear! They are all temporary effects (excluding Max Ammo). Insta-kill makes zombies die after one hit - whether that be a knife or a shot. This does not mean you are invincible, though! Be careful. Double points doubles the amount of points you gain from actions: 20 points for one hitmarker, 260 points for a knife, etc. This is merely a dog bone to the players. Max Ammo gives you the full amount of ammo in your ammo stock, and replenishes everything. This is key to your survival, and is rather rare. Reload before getting this - it doesn't fill your current clip's ammo. Fire Sale puts the Random Weapon Box at each location, and reduces the cost to 10 points. This lasts for only 30 seconds. Death Machine will temporarily equip you with a Death Machine to unleash hell on the zombies with. Pretty self-explanatory. Carpenter rebuilds all barricades in the map for you and gives you 200 points. Nuke kills all zombies currently spawned and gives you 400 points (a pretty good savior). Do not rely on these - there's no telling when they'll appear!



I will be adding more to this but I have to head off to class. Hope this helps you!

Firstly, only half of the gun you use in zombies was designed by Broken Arrow at the Die Rise facility. (It wasn't actually called the Die Rise facility, but for lack of anything else I will refer to it as that) 

The barrel of the gun and the main body (Barrel is the top part you get when you add the fire extinguisher part, main body is the part you find on the barrel or upstairs next to sink) were designed by Broken Arrow, the stock, fire extinguisher, and trigger were improvised by the N4. (most likely Marlton helped out by Russman when he wasn't going through memory lapses) 

Now that we've clarified that, I would like to explain the evidence that the prototype parts built by Broken Arrow in conjuction with the easy labour from the sweat shops in the nearby building were designed by Russman. 

Firstly, we know that Russman worked for Broken Arrow thanks to the Buried cut scene, and that he worked at the Die Rise facility (it's in the background in the scene where he is kicked out) 

Secondly, and most importantly, if you look at the Sliquifier in game, it has Russ/thisareaiscoveredbystrap/n written on the main body (a part built by Broken Arrow) 

HOWEVER

I would like to add that Russman is a pseudonym, and in my opinion is not most likely his real name, and could even be a mispronounced word from his memory (say, he lead an operation called Project Russman/Russwater/Ruwatever) and he took it as his name. 

And yes, he could have had a hand in the creation of Who's Who and his... Idiocracy could be a result of him testing one of his new perks upon himself.

1354597963.0,55,self.CODZombies,148wgc,Some fairly unknown Grief tips/strategies.,59,4,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/148wgc/some_fairly_unknown_grief_tipsstrategies/,"Just thought I'd write up some tips/strategies that aren't often discussed. I'd love to hear some others :) 

These first few tips are universal tips and for Green Run also. However, Cell Block specific tips are further down.

I will keep updating this page with each new Grief map.


- For those that don't know, throwing grenades at the mystery box works great. When an enemy is using it and the guns are cycling through, throw your grenades just near the box. The enemy won't be able to pick up the gun, all the enemy will see on his/her screen is ""Press X to throw back grenade"". They actually can't pick up the gun. As long as you keep throwing grenades, the option to pick up the weapon won't appear   

- You can knife players of ledges, causing them to fall down. A great strategy (on town) is to throw a monkey bomb right under the hole in the quick revive building (second story). Since an enemy player will notice this, he'll be right near the ledge, shooting directing below at the zombies grouped up. Just knife the unsuspecting player and he'll fall down into the massive group of zombies, heh.

- Make sure you pick up the power ups right away, even if you should reload (if there is a max ammo), if the enemy team picks it up, you won't have it at all. All power up effects don't do anything if the enemy team picks it up. However, a nuke will have a universal effect, killing all zombies. The team who picks it up will be the team to get the 400 points though.

- This is risky and sort of a jerky strategy, but throw an EMP grenade at Jugs. This will cause the enemies (and your team) to loose it. The thing is, there is no warning other than the perk icon becoming a darker color. The effect is so minimal that the enemy team will most likely not notice it and eventually go down since they are playing thinking they have Jug.

- When a Firesale is active, shoot the enemies. This slows them down, allowing your team to get the box first, instead of them. 

- Make sure to use the 'meat' on an enemy player, specifically on one is downed or a player who may be attempting to revive someone. Using it on Jugs after someone has downed could be effective, since they are trying to get Jugs back and can't with all the Zombies in the area.

- Finally, some more obvious tactics: Throw EMP grenades at the enemies mystery box turn. Throw EMP grenades at the PaP when an enemy is using it. Throw Monkey Bombs at a downed player. Shoot players when they are near a big group of Zombies to slow them down. Knife players to cancel their revive. Stand infront of doors to block the enemy from entering. There are some more obvious ones, but you'll most likely come accross them anyway from general play.

**Cell Block UPDATE**

- The PaP'd starting pistol (M1911) + PhD Flopper (found next to the Olympia) is an insanely good combo. For those that don't know why, I won't reveal it. I'll just the surprise. Just do it! Increase's your survivability significantly and your ability the revive others/defend other revivng.

- Don't forget that when someone buys one of the spawn doors (for MotD) the other door opens too. The same works for Grief. So if someone is blocking the door in the spawn in or out, just run around to the other door that leads into it. The less used pathway into the spawn area is above the MP5. It's also a good backup route. If you're low on money and need to escape but a spawn door is blocked - run to the other. It's definitely open.

- A few tips here for the PaP area. 

Firstly, when you insert your weapon into the machine. Immediately run back, or crouch/prone.  There aren't any barriers on the PaP walkway. By crouching/running back, this prevents the enemy team to knife/push you off. Feel free to do it to them though :D

Secondly, if there is someone with the PaP'd starting pistol, Mustang and Sally (just look for two bright orange pistols in their hands if you don't know) DO NOT PACK A PUNCH. This is an example of people abusing the game. If you were to put in your gun, they will kill themselves right in front of the machine. Why? Because this prevents you from picking up your weapon when it comes out of the machine. You just can't take it. There is no option to do so. All because the enemy is downed right infront of it. To be safe, wait until they are gone. If they won't leave. Just try your best to knife there away slightly, put it in and stay as close to the machine as possible.

Thirdly, enemies spawn in the PaP walkway REALLY fast. So be careful when PaP'ing. When you put in your weapon, your stuck in an animation. It also takes time to draw your other weapon after. So make sure you are equipped. It's always best to PaP between rounds.

- When feeding the dogs (or, Dreamcatchers), when you feel like it's going to disappear and a drop will spawn, immediately lay prone under the area the drop comes from. The enemy team can't knife you out of the way and steal it. 

- The fan trap: A great surprise weapon. It does have a slight start up time. So you'll have to time it right if you're trying to take down an enemy with it. To avoid the Fan Trap, simply move prone under it. 

- To avoid the Acid Trap....well....you can't. At least not when it comes to moving through it. When moving through the Acid Trap area, always run. It also has a start up time. Try to jump at the end too. A quick burst of distance from a jump can help you prevent the damaging blows the Acid Trap deals. If your in a down state while the trap it on and you're underneath it, always crawl to the side your teammates are on. Don't lay there expecting them to walk through it. This works the same for the enemies. Even if there aren't any Zombies - turn it on if someone is down. They can't go through it to revive them, almost guaranteeing a death for the enemy.

- When it comes to Brutus, try to seek out enemies and have Brutus follow them. You just need to run a close distance to them and hope Brutus wants them dead now. When Brutus is following an enemy - shoot the enemy. This slows them down, allowing Brutus to whack the enemy to death. 

- Brutus is unaffected by traps, and ignores them completely. He will shut them down too, so don't activate a trap when Brutus is around, it's a waste of money. However, when an enemy is trying to escape Brutus, a trap can lockout a pathway, leaving the enemy team to stay where they are, unable to escape from him. There is always a chance though that Brutus will just immediately shut the trap off anyway, allowing the enemy team some space to breathe. It's a bit of a gamble.

- The Death Machine is actually a great investment in this. PaP it. It becomes an insanely good weapon. It's great for defending teammates, shooting enemies to slow them for long periods of time and to kill Brutus. Huge tip: Burst fire. It's very powerful. Unless you're in a situation that needs full auto fire, burst firing will do you just fine. The ammo also lasts a very, very long time (as you would expect). Since this is the type of map in which you're most likely to stay in one area, it gives an advantage to people who use this weapon. It's at it's best when your in a stationary position.

- Ray Gun + PhD Flopper. A great combo. No splash damage. Great for Brutus.

- PaP'd BlunderGat + Speed Cola. Another great combo. I've seen someone stand at the end of a walkway, mowing down enemies at a high round, just with this combo. 

**Will update for next map... If there is one...**



I will consistently update this post with tips/strategies that people have commented below:

- (LittleCucumber) When a player on the other team is down, bring a horde around the downed player so the other team can't revive him.

- (wellllzy) When playing grief on farm camp near the mystery box after its opened up and wait for the opposing team to use the box. After they start spinning the box quickly knife them off the ledge and then run over to the top of the stairs and lay prone at an angle so they can't run back up there and retrieve their weapon. It's a pretty easy and dickhead-ish way to piss people off. The first couple hits at the box are somewhat crucial. If you can screw that up for a couple of the guys on the other team then your chances of winning are great!


- (I_am_sorrow) When an enemy is downed and the other team is prone reviving him dolphin dive on top of the guy reviving and it will kill him too. Just have your team pick you up.

- (randomjellybean) ""Cover your man"" strategy. If you have 4 organized players (can still be done solo). Cover your respective color on the opposite team and steal all the kills, knife them off windows and board them up. If they go for the box make it difficult.

1374851167.0,52,self.CODZombies,1j3m8u,I was a bit curious...,64,12,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1j3m8u/i_was_a_bit_curious/,"I don't often decide to play solo to give a shot at the higher rounds, but 2 nights ago I felt like playing Buried to see how far I could go. As I played, I thought about documenting the number of kills I have at the start of each round. That way, I could have an idea of the number of zombies that spawned in each round, and in the future, I'd have an idea of what to expect. I started recording this from round 20. This was simply out of curiosity. I avoided picking up Nukes as much as possible. Then from round 30, I thought it would be interesting to document the frequency of Max Ammo drops, because they can be crucial for your survival if you hold Monkeys (or anything along those lines). 

These are my summarized findings, for those of you that might be interested or as curious as I was:

* Round 20: 60 zombies spawn in.
* Round 25: 80 zombies.
* Round 30: 105 zombies. 99 spawned in on round 29.
* Round 35: 123 zombies. 
* Round 40: 168 zombies. 
* Round 45: 206 zombies. 198 spawned in on round 44. 
* Round 50: 249 zombies. 
* Round 53: 276 zombies. 

Unfortunately I ended the game in the middle of round 54 with 6000 kills because I was tired of playing for 5 hours. I did notice that in each successive round, the number of zombies that spawned did not increase with a definitive pattern. My guess is that after round 55, you'll have more than 300 zombies spawning in per round. *If you want to know the numbers of zombies that spawned in on the intermediary rounds (i.e. 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, ... , 46, 47, 48, etc...) just let me know. Maybe someone can figure out a pattern that I'm not seeing. I did, however, knife my way into 2 nukes during insta-kills towards the end of round 36, and towards the beginning of round 49 (so the number of zombies that spawn in on those rounds will be inaccurate).*

As for the max ammo drops (recorded from round 30 onward), I got them on the following rounds: 30, 32 (there were 2 on this round), 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54. I noticed that you'd more likely get them towards the beginning of the round than the end. So you can expect a max ammo almost every round. 

Other experiences: From round 39 onward, I started using the Paralyzer when I got tired of pumping thousands of PaP'd AN-94 rounds into the zombies. I was going for points, so I was only shooting the lower portions of the zombies. On round 48, it took 3 bursts from the PaP'd Ray Gun MKII to kill a zombie. You know how the MKII's bursts go through multiple zombies in the earlier rounds? Well the zombie on this round absorbed all the 'rays.' They didn't come out the zombie's back.  On round 51, a regular RPG from the mystery box would not kill a zombie. I fired all the rockets at a zombie's feet, and all it did was become a crawler that still had a ton of health. (I tested these for fun when I had the last few slow-walking zombies alive at the end of each round. I'll do more tests for fun next time). 

I hope this information was at least a bit interesting to some of you. ",,False,self,t5_2sal9,False,,revive,True,t3_1j3m8u,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1j3m8u/i_was_a_bit_curious/,

Zombies move so **God damn fast**! You're trying to move from your extremely inconvenient spawn, switching your weapon on the unfortunate lone soul who tried to kill you. **BWAM!** Fucking zombies break Mach 5 and slam you in the asshole.

2. M1911. What the fuck? How the hell does Treyarch expect us to empty **three** mags into some other player who sprints like all hell at us?

3. Kill-whore/Non-strategy teammates. Every time I play, every zombie rushes at the same time to kill me, but whenever I'm the zombie, nobody moves and watched me get anally fisted until the survivor gets the M1911, which they are thoroughly fucked unless it's insta-kill.

4. Small map. It seems there is **NOWHERE** to go, and few camping spots, as it is **impossible** to out-run previously mentioned Jessie Owens of zombies.

5. You glow neon orange? As soon as I spawn, trying to figure out where I am and where to go, every single zombie just flies out of nowhere, and as afore-mentioned, thoroughly fuck you and there is nothing you can do about it. However, whenever I get killed as the human, I can **never** spot the orange glow until he kills someone.

6. You do everything slower. I try to throw a grenade because I can hear all three zombies waiting by the same spot, and as soon as I click the pin, SKADOOSH- they all run out as I'm still trying to pick up my gun which I **must've thrown halfway across fucking America** because it takes me three years to pull it back out.

7. The knifing system. No words, except for **How the fuck do I smash his face in several times in a fucking row and he feels nothing, but lunges me halfway across the damn map?!**

8. You derank so goddamn fast because every time you get killed, it's a down. Fuck that.

9. As a zombie, you make so much noise, you can't sneak up on anyone and unless you're playing with good teammates who perform group rushes from different directions, front and center charging is a terrible idea.

Thanks for reading, and if you didn't notice, it helped a lot to let it all out. Comment your bullshit moments and how much you hated it. Goodbye!

Richtofen and Marlton (nerdy character) talk about using something to become unstoppable.Marlton talks about the electronic force in Nuketown, which will make him unstoppable.The electronic force might be the thing in the comic book, because you can see electricity emitting from﻿ it.It might be a new super weapon, which ties in with the new characters.Richtofen and Marlton are both trying to get it to become unstoppable.Richtoffen might not be unstoppable yet even though he controls the zombies.

 That may be why Richtofen is now targeting them, maybe the electronic force could stop his control over the zombies, or the zombies in general.That may be why Maxis helps you through the steps in Transit.Also It seems like Marlton knew zombies would rise at some point, maybe that was what he was studying and got banished. 

Also I think Richtofen created the Electrical Zombie and was an attempt at trying to get the electrical force.I﻿ think the tower of Babel is one of many towers which will stop the zombies when all activated at once, that's why they are in the Northern Hemisphere.They will probably have to activate towers around the world to create an electrical force﻿ which will stop all of the zombies. 

Also I have proof Richtofen created the Electrical Zombie.In Nuketown you can here a distorted voice say ""POWER"" and Richtofen says he should have created a robot instead.Also I think the electrical force is a gigantic EMP.Because if you use an EMP grenade on a zombie you see the blue in their﻿ eyes go away.The blue eyes show Richtofen controls zombies, so maybe an EMP could destroy all of his control over the zombies.",,False,self,t5_2sal9,1357183477.0,,,True,t3_15v6pd,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/15v6pd/black_ops_2_zombies_almost_solved/,

1356032728.0,46,self.CODZombies,156lix,Tranzit setup for a successful game,60,14,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/156lix/tranzit_setup_for_a_successful_game/,"I've seen some posts about players struggling to get to higher rounds in Tranzit and thought I would write a quick guide for beginners on how my team sets up Tranzit.

If you have any tips/tricks to add, please do! This isn't a perfect guide, but it works well for us. I use this method in solo as well as with a team.

First of all, USE THE BANK! I make sure I have at least 40,000 in it, so I can setup the entire map and get everything I need before round 2.

I will run a few games in custom match (on easy) or solo to just simply stock points in the bank. 

Ok, let's start.

When you start at the bus depot.
Kill every zombie EXCEPT 1 (a slow walker helps). Do not knife or shoot the last zombie, he should not be wounded in any way or he will bleed out and the round will cycle.

Build the turbine, exit the bus depot via doors you use turbine to open. Don't worry about last zombie, just get on bus and get moving. One person needs at least 1,000 points before they leave Bus Depot. The zombie as long as he is not wounded will follow you around the map indefinitely, re-spawning at new locations along the way. You can also get the zombie to latch onto the windows of bus at any point and rebuild windows as he tears it down. Done effectively he will never get in and you will get points and upgraded planks quickly.

After the Bus leaves Depot you will head to Diner. You don't really need anything here yet so just stay on bus and get ready to take the shortcut after you leave Diner. I wait until after the bus crosses the lava after Diner and count to 7 slowly. I then exit the bus and run behind it and across the road. The shortcut is right next to the church in-between a truck and a car. Follow that and you end up in town. This gives you enough time to open the bank, open the vault, withdraw money and get the bar and juggs unlocked and purchased (with turbine because power is still off) before the bus arrives at Town.

Once the bus arrives at town I usually have also purchased Semtex and checked room in Town for parts (you are looking for top of Diner/Bus part, you want this before any other part first). I also destroy my turbine before leaving town (with semtex), so I can grab a fresh turbine at Bus Depot again.

Board Bus (bring zombie) head to Bus Depot. Unlock Bus depot door, get fresh turbine, board bus. At Diner you need to unlock the Diner and install Bus part at Diner so you can get Galvaknuckles. Buy Galvaknuckles, buy Speed Cola, unlock garage and start hitting the box. I am looking for: EMP Grenades, HAMR, RPD, Ray Gun, Executioner, Galil, MTAR (maybe). I like to hit the box until it moves to next location, this will help in later rounds.

You should now be setup with: Juggernaut, Stamina Up, Speed Cola, Galvaknuckles and 2 guns you like.

Board bus and head to Farm.

At Farm I will buy the last useful Perk I need. I purchase Double Tap and open Shed with turbine and grab whatever part is there and Claymores. You can open House if you like, but not necessary.

Board Bus, head to Power.

At Power I exit bus and very quickly setup the parts to turn power on and use turbine to exit power room after power has been turned on. Hopefully you have ladder for outside of Bus as well now, If not wait behind Bus until it starts to move. Either way, the goal here is to drop your turbine into the Power room entrance before Bus leaves so you can open Pack-A-Punch. Timed correctly you should be able to board bus again and head back to Town with Turbine keeping PAP open.

Arrive at Town, enter vault immediately, build Pack-A-Punch.

Kill Zombie, you're done!

You now should have: All 4 Perks you like, Galvaknuckles, 2 guns you like (Pack-A-Punched if you have cash), The Entire map unlocked, Power on and ready to run a successful game of Tranzit or attack the Easter Egg by Round 2.

Thoughts?

I am about to shit on the box, by the following points below. This primarily applies to die rise but some of my points apply to TranZit as well.

- The box is much weaker in this installment of zombies. There is no wonder weapon (besides the ray gun) in the box. Most of the box weapons suck as well. (SMR... Type25... SMR... Ballistic Knife... SMR... Barrett... KAP-40...) need I go on? These weapons need to be more powerful than they currently are. 

- Box weapons need their accuracy fixed. The Type 25 and the SMR don't even seem to register to be ADSing when you actually ADS. It seems like you are always hip firing.

- Make the box more exciting! Add MORE LMGS, more Assault Rifles! If you can't do that, put the AN-94 in the box and the Type 25 on the wall. 

- Bring back the crossbow! Its better in this installment, plus it works so well in tangent with Mule Kick.

- DON'T put the box so far out of the way! To get to it on Die Rise you can only take one specific path in order to initially gain access to it.

- Bring back the hacker as a buildable! You could hack the box to share weapons. This would especially be useful in BLOPS2, where people can join mid game.


TL:DR: Buff box weapons, easier to access, put in more weapons, maybe incorporate it with a buildable or two.",,False,self,t5_2sal9,False,,lvl4,True,t3_193xbr,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/193xbr/what_needs_to_change_the_mystery_box/,

If majority say no then the game continues with a timer then starts. I think it would help a lot of people who have to go the bathroom or have to eat and they are in the middle of a round.

1: Turn on Power (Do not turn it off)

2: Collect all 4 pieces of the Obelisk Table

* Meteor (Hole in wall at Bus Depot, must crouch)

* Wooden Plank (Tunnel or second power room under the stairs)

* Radio (Nacht Der Untoten)

* Power Box (Farm by the fridge or in Town by the outside Mystery Box)

3: Take the components to the Obelisk and construct.

4: Build Jet Gun (4 parts)

* Handle (Nacht Der Untoten)

* Jet Engine (Tunnel)

* Wire (Alternately used for electric trap, found at power)

* Pressure Gauge (Cabin)

5: Take components to town and construct at the work station by Staminup.

6: Take the gun to the Obelisk Tower, go underneath it and fire strait up. (If done correctly you will hear Richtofen speak)

7: Create a horde of zombies and kill them all at once under the Tower with **EXPLOSIVE WEAPONS**. (If done correctly you will hear Richtofen speak)

8: Everyone must get EMP grenades, everyone. 

9: Create 4 different teleporters around the map, and at the same time, have everyone throw an EMP grenade at the teleporter. (If done correctly you will hear Richtofen speak, and you will get the Achievement)

Notes:

* If you already have the achievement for completing Maxis' side, you will not get a different achievement. 

* I strongly suggest 4 people, but it can be done with 3. I don't know how to accomplish it with 2 people, or on solo.

* Make a couple money runs on easy to store in the bank vault for use in the real deal. It may take you a couple hundred tries at the box, or it may take you one try. You will need plenty of money.

1. A bank perma perk? My buddy got the green puff while withdrawing money from the bank.

2. Only losing 1 perk after going down and getting revived. I don't know what I did but every time I went down I would only lose one perk, and I would keep all 3 guns (till I lost mule kick). 

3. No Drops. From round 30 something till 44 we didn't get any drops, so no max ammos, instas, 2x points, nothing. Very annoying.

Why does this sub hate PTG? I always see them being called lairs on here eventhough the info they put out has been proven time and time again to be true. Eversince WaW they've been giving correct information out and I've even seen a video of theirs that is more than two years old with stuff in it that hasn't even been released today, and yet this community just refuses to believe it.

I also see them described as 'cocky' an awful lot, too. But put yourself in their shoes: If you  knew what others wanted to know, and were literally giving them this information, and then getting hated for it, how would you feel?

Maybe it's a result of the huge controversy between PTG, NGT, Syndicate and whoever else. But I really don't know, so please inform me and all the others who don't know what the deal is with the hatred towards them.

Sorry if I'm coming off as a 'PTG fanboy'. Yes I do watch their content, but I tried to make this thread as little 'OMG PTG are the best' as possible. I just feel like people are rejecting information about zombies in the future, and it's a shame, I feel.

And one final note. When people comment 'can't wait to see how wrong this is' etc. and then it turns out to be true, nobody says anything. There's no 'Oh, hey, turns out they were right.', people just move on to their next theory and shit on that too.

**Mic Etiquette** :If you have a mic great! Don't overuse it.  There is no need for your music or your conversation with people we cannot hear. The mute function works in zombies just as it does in multiplayer, if you want my help don't annoy me. Trolls will not make it to high rounds.  If you do not have a mic and two people in the lobby do, kindly back out.  There are plenty of lobbies forming with people with no mic. 



**Easter Egg/Power** :If you want to do the Easter Egg discuss it in the lobby.  There are too many of us who have done it/ don't give a shit.  With this being said, once the power is on there is no reason to shut it off, I repeat, **NEVER SHUT THE POWER OFF** it turns perks off and gets unsuspecting people killed...and again trolls do not make high rounds. 



**Loners** : Loners are excepted, I personally feel staying alone higher rounds have more survivability.  Just don't back out/dash if you lose your ray gun.  Dying at round 8-10 happens, at that point all it takes is a decent gun and half skill to recover, don't be a dick.



**The Hatch** At high rounds the location of the hatch has minimal effect on the game.  Its a personal preference, if the hatch does not end up where you want it, don't leave or be a dick.  Go get the Bowie for fog travel and hit the electric guy two more times, not a big deal. 


**Zombie Train Location** : I can with a bit of ease train zombies at the Tunnel, Diner and Farm.  There are a few other locations that work but those are my favorite.  I will not hog the Diner even though it is my favorite, if someone else only knows how to survive there, I give it to them.  Ultimately it leads to higher rounds, which gives you a higher k/d.  


And now I'm bored of writing this guide.  Any other general suggestions that newer players might find use of?

&gt; Ok, well let's not completely shoot down this theory. Where did the green light in Call of the Dead lead to? Was it some kind of UFO beam? One human was sent up it in the easter egg. Maybe that one human was Samuel? Maybe this would tie in with Samuel's quote ""I know what those aliens do in their floating discs"".
I have my doubts, but who knows.

That is a great theory. So it would have to go in steps like this:

* Random ass zombie on Call of the Dead gets shot with the VR-11 and turns into business man with BO
* Turns out it's Stu and he gets beamed up
* Stays as human and eventually comes down to earth
* He is now slowly turning back into a zombie

1368216876.0,35,self.CODZombies,1e3818,No-Mic etiquette,51,16,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1e3818/nomic_etiquette/,"So I play a lot in the middle of the night when I'd prefer not to be talking loudly due to others in my household sleeping.  Therefore I usually never play with a mic unless it's my usual zombie killing crew.  I've been doing this since Black Ops 1 and I just wanted to give you a rundown of what I consider my etiquette to be for not using a mic.

**Pre Game Lobby**

* If I get into a lobby with any mics in it then I instantly leave.  When you are put into a lobby, however, you get connected first and then you yourself connect, which gives other players a couple extra seconds of seeing you before you see them.  Therefore 3/4 of the time I get into a lobby with one kid screaming 'GET A DAMN MIC WTF ARE YOU EVEN...' and by then I usually have left the lobby.  So a little courtesy request is give a no mic like 5 seconds before you start getting unnecessarily upset about it. People get so worked up so fast. 

* If I'm put into a match with 3 no mics and 1 mic then the 1 mic should either leave or accept it and play with all of us.  I've been in a lobby with one mic who sat and yelled for like 40 seconds straight at the entire lobby of no mics to leave.  Don't be that guy please 

* If it's a standoff of 2 mics vs 2 no mics, I give it 5 seconds then leave.  Mics take priority in my mind so I'd rather just give it up and try to find a no mic lobby.

also split-screeners count as 2 mics to me if the main one has a mic plugged in. 

**In Match**

Most of the etiquette really just comes with the pre game lobby.  Once you are in a match then it's map specific etiquette and knowing to leave other peoples zombies alone.  I've found that non verbal communication is fairly easy just by knifing things or crouching on things a bunch. I try to always find players with blue eye'd skulls or knifes through the skull, that way you at least know they play daily and can probably handle themselves. 




**TL:DR** If a no mic is in your lobby and you don't want them to be, give them 5 seconds to get out before you get mad.  And if 2 or more players have mics and you don't, just back out.

As we all know The Uprising DLC is going to be released on April 16th, eager like many of you I decided to do some more research after only seeing so little gameplay footage. I have some information to share that I found regarding reviving and how it will happen in Motd. This comes from the activision investors page so it is a reliable source.

""Following tradition of the original Call of Duty: Black Ops fan-favorite Zombies mode ""Call of the Dead,"" Call of Duty: Black Ops II Uprising's wildly creative new ""Mob of the Dead"" Zombies experience finds the four prohibition-era mobsters, Billy Handsome (Liotta), Al ""The Weasel"" Arlington (Pantoliano), Salvatore ""Sal"" DeLuca (Palmentiri), and Michael ""Finn"" O'Leary (Madsen) serving time in Alcatraz Prison, only to discover that being behind bars is the least of their problems. With plans to break out of Alcatraz foiled by the rise of the undead, the quartet of inmates will have to lean on their mob-derived skills with firearms, blunt instruments and improvised weaponry as they battle the zombies infesting and overrunning the island. In order to survive, players must work their way through the steel cells and aging concrete buildings while fighting off a multitude of zombified prisoners and guards trapped on the island with them. Additionally, if a player becomes an unfortunate victim, ""Mob of the Dead's"" new feature known as ""Purgatory"" sends players into the afterlife. This new twist on Zombies gameplay is ripe with its own set of objectives, and offers ""fans a truly new and unique experience""

This is definitely something worth talking about and expanding on how we think it may work. So there you are, that's our character names and some insight on purgatory. Something to remember is PlaytheGame mentioned there would be 4 electric chairs,perhaps they are the key between worlds?

So I came up with this myself. After I had gotten the Trophy, I went online and checked how other people did it. Surprisingly they all took a lot longer/pointless routes (from the ones I saw)
Here's how you do it as quickly as possible.

* Round 1 starts, get down to the bottom floor Asap.
* Kill all zombies by shooting them in the leg 8 times and then Knife to maximize points. (to be honest I didn't really take my time with it... Sometimes I missed or just felt lazy and knifed them straight away...)
* Open up the General store, build the Tramplesteam on the work bench in the upstairs room of the house beside Leroys Cell.
* Free Leroy.

---Now, this is where this guide differs from others (that I have seen)---

* 
* **If The Alcohol Spawns back in his cell, don't do this step yet. Instead, get the Alcohol and move onto the next step** Run to the top of Leroys Cell again (don't drop down), and go through the tunnels leading to the Saloon. Get the Alcohol that spawns here. You also need to purchase the 750 points debris that blocks your way
* You need to get into the Juggernog corridor and line up Leroys back to the Armory. Make sure you take your time here. Give him the Alcohol.
* This should open up the Armory and give you around 2000 points. This makes it so you have super easy access to the Armory and will make getting this achievement a lot easier. **You get 2000 points because the longer Leroy has to run, The more points you recieve**
* now you have to proceed to put the Chalk drawings on the Question Marks.

**In order**

1. On the building holding Leroys Cell.
2. Right on top of the stairs on the Room with the Turbine you built
3. On the Top floor of the Courthouse (the building where the Box is beside). **You can get here by using the Tramplesteam right outside the Building with the Turbine in it. Just place it down close to the edge and jump on it. You'll know you're in the right building if you see Speed Cola**
4. This one is on the roof of the Saloon. You can get here by taking the tunnel from the roof of the building that contains Leroy's Cell

* There's a couple things you have to do in the Saloon.

1. Purchase Alcohol for 1000 points.
2. Turn on the power by jumping across from the roof of the Saloon. **Make sure you don't forget to turn on the power... It's really frustrating when you get to the PaP machine and it says that You need to turn on the power first**

* After that, get to the General store and drop down from upstairs to the other half of the map.
* Open up the Church by giving Leroy the Booze (also, try to get him to run the longest line possible. More time running=more Points)
* Use the Tramplesteam again to get over the Debris beside the Sweets shop and get 2 things.

1. The final Chalk drawing.
2. The B23R. (The weapon I personally used. I've tried the PDW, the AN94, and the MP5... None seemed to work as well as the B23R)

* Make your way back to the Second half of the map from the General Store, pick up your Tramplesteam, and place it in front of the Boulder that has crushed the Fence in front of the Ghosty Bitches house.
* Enter the Ghosty Bitches house. There's a set amount that spawn in, if you take to long in the house, they will start spawning behind you. So keep moving forward. I'll try to list off where you'll encounter the Ghosty Bitches from the top of my head.

1. To your left as you go up the stairs.
2. Right after #1 from the room
3. There's one as the bookshelf opens up,
4. One near the end of the Bookshelf tunnel
5. I think there's either one or two after #4. Just careful make your way to the end.
6. (or 7). One or more will follow you outside of the Mansion. Keep your guard up till you see a Perk Drop. That's how you know it's over.

* That's it :)! Hopefully you guys found this useful. If you have faster methods please let me know. I don't know of a faster one that this.

One last note; With this way of doing it, you should be able to buy a weapon in the beginning and still have Points leftover to do all this if you fail with the Box. You could hope to get the Petrifier and save time by not having to build/use the Tramplsteam.",,False,self,t5_2sal9,False,,doubletap,True,t3_1jjxx7,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1jjxx7/ive_seen_a_couple_videos_on_how_to_pap_on_round_1/,

1373075527.0,39,self.CODZombies,1hq5ls,My take on the Zombies storyline in general...,48,9,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1hq5ls/my_take_on_the_zombies_storyline_in_general/,"Ok... lets start with Shi No Numa and Der Reise... in both, we have the wall scrawlings, the O4 begin in Shi No, and more evidence of a storyline in zombies beginning as with Verruckt. In Shi No and Der (not sure about the other 2) there's the scrawling on the wall that reads ""Return through Aether"" which means the realm Sam/Richtofen/Maxis, depending on what youre doing on your games, are at and in control of the zombies. But, noone else really knows about this realm except the ones in it, the O4 and eventually the N4 i think; so who scrawled this? Other survivors? How could they possibly know? Then we have ""Ascend from darkness"" and what not which I can believe meaning that we have to become enlightened to what is occurring there, i.e. Richtofens Grand Scheme at one point and that he's not in ti to only survive. 

This is on Nacht Der Untoten i know, but personally, I believe they had a good part of the story figured out once Zombies began on WAW.

Next comes Kino Der Toten. We have made it to the future and see that time travel is possible. We get more story, more background and new zombies/weapons, and a giant teddy bear :3 (jk) from here we find ourselves in either Five or Ascension as they both take place at the same time based off the red phones in Ascension. 

In ascension, theres a man trapped in a device by what we believe is Samantha Maxis. This is our first instance of the Easter Egg, aside from Der Reise. But we help him escape to some unknown place, provided we havent just killed him flat out. We also get some minor story here. In Five, we dont get much but we learn the Americans have been working with 115 as the Winter's Howl and Thunder Gun are seen here. And not just in the box.

Next comes Call Of The Dead, a very big step here as Richtofen guides us to retrieve a Golden Rod that he somehow knows about that we have to get. But how? It makes no sense to us here. But we give them the rod, get more story and perks and see the 115 can effect people/things differently.

From here is Shangri-la, another large example of my soon-to-come main point. We help two adventurers escape and basically find ourselves in their shoes as we retrieve the 115 meteorite. But a key not here is ""Richtofen"" inscribed on the altar of the stone. How? Why? We dont know still. Maybe Illuminati as seen in Der Reise? Doubtful.

After this we have Moon. Our finale for Blops1 and the O4 for now. Here, the two components Richt has retrieved and combined are put to use. We begin the largest EE yet and Richtofen continues to know how to do what we need to do until he and Sam switch bodies and he becomes in control of everything. We also learn Maxis is alive but in a different realm. The Aether. For both Richtofen and Sam as well. But then, Maxis has us proceed to blow up the Earth! But why? It didnt stop Richtofen or anything, but it did set up Buried to be in the perfect position for a Scalene Triangle with all 3 EEs. We hear no more of the O4 after this except for mere hints.

Next after a long wait we have Tranzit. The Earth is in chaos and Richtofen/Maxis are having us set up a tower for some reason. The N4 show some questions towards the overlord they now hear and try to decide to help or not. 

From here, we are taken to Die Rise in China or somewhere like that to activate another tower. We also get some anger form Maxis if we disobey him. But in the opening cinematic, we find out that the group is basically in a time loop reset by Richtofen as he pleases and also, Stuhlinger begins hearing zombie snarls constantly. We get this tower and are rewarded. 

Next we have MOTD (yes ive skipped Nuketown completely. Sorry. Not muchthere) this map im saving for last. It is the key. After this: Buried. I cant say much on it though aside from this is IT. The decider of all. But we have the time bomb more freedom in things and more puzzles and a very unique EE along with ghosts. Theres a thing called Infinity Mode though in which we find our bodies and zombies are invincible.

What do almost all of our maps have in common? A time loop of sorts is mentioned or seen. The clock on Der Reise is going a few seconds and resets back and it is an atomic clock, if i recognize it right, those things are nearly never wrong. Ever. Next Kino, time travel first thing, not much there aside from the portraits of our characters which is unusual. Next we have stopped clocks in 5 and Ascension.  After that, COTD, which not much there unfortunately. Then shangri-la we have a direct experience of a time loop. After this Moon, which is the transfer of power, some evidence of time travel here as well. In Tranzit, more stopped clocks and an unmoving Sun. In Die Rise, the intro shows a time loop exactly. In Buried, we have evidence of what we have done in the future staying in effect in the past, i.e. break barriers and open doors, etc.

Now. Mob of the Dead. The map itself is a cycle of life and death. A time loop in itself in hell. We have another set of stopped clocks too. From this though, we see their writing stays but they dont remember it. Keep this in mind. Here though, we break the cycle and achieve an end. Death. Mob of the Dead shows so many aspects of time travel in the universe of CODZ and it is reinforced by numerous other aspects in maps.

Heres my belief. The entirety of zombies from Shi No Numa and Nacht/Verruckt is one giant time loop the characters are stuck in. Hence why theres writing about the Aether in Shi No and Der Reise. Along with mentions by Tank of regaining memories that Richtofen was evil or something in Ascension upon PAPing. This is exactly the same as the 4 of MOTD slowly remembering things as they fight, i.e. guns,the box, perks, afterlife, etc. Back to the writing; everyones believing the final map is in the Aether, and if it is, or connects to it, that writing will insinuate that going through the Aether enables you to return to the start of the cycle. But the time we are playing now, like MOTD, is the time they break the cycle and we get the same decision; stop the zombies by repeating the cycle and trying again, or stop them and put an end to it all. Or would restarting it be the end of the story? After all, what better end than a beginning right? A real kick in the dick personally. On a personal note again, this isnt the first time ive seen this. If you care about getting the end to Stephen King's Dark Tower series spoiler, skip ahead some.

End spoilers if you cared. Of course, this is my theory. I left stuff out i think and may edit later, but there you go.

TL;DR: Nazi Zombies storyline is one huge time loop.

Edit: Currently listening to the song Always Running finally with lyrics because I've needed to for a while... but in the lyrics, it states ""It begins again in mystery... and i always end up there... always unsuspecting... so easy to lure them away from... all the angels within..."" now as tempting as a Bioshock reference is, oh who am i kidding ""The angels sleeping daddy!!"", now that that's out of the way: we know Sherwoods songs have always had a deep meaning in correlation to the story itself... but here Malukah sings the above mentioned lines. in the start of zombies, we found ourselves in Shi No Numa, no idea how we got there, as everything was boarded up, no idea who we really were, and no idea what went on here, just like verruckt and Nacht, but this was worse as we had characters with personalities and more wall writings/radios, etc. We face much more mystery here than ever before, and it only increases when we hit Der Reise, right? But we have more radios to shed light but add twice as much mystery to what's going on as before. Tell me I'm reaching here, but did we not have the monkey Bomb in Der Reise to lure the zombies away from us? basically the only hopes of salvation, the angels for the world that were in which we find the original four, the angels, obviously one is an angel of mal intentions, sort of the Lucifer in the storyline if i may say. but nevertheless, the song says we always end up there, shrouded in mystery, but it's always easy to lure them away from the angels within. the angels within the hell on Earth? I'm not sure myself, but in due time, we may have more clues (ba da tish) coming across the board that may prove/disprove my theory.",,False,self,t5_2sal9,1373422148.0,,,True,t3_1hq5ls,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1hq5ls/my_take_on_the_zombies_storyline_in_general/,

1371015147.0,36,self.CODZombies,1g6g4b,"After listening the suggestions about a zombie map mixed with multiplayer features, I made a small compilation of how it could work.",52,16,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1g6g4b/after_listening_the_suggestions_about_a_zombie/,"After seeing them, I got a few ideas of how a Zombies + MP mix could work.z

1 - It would have six characters, each one from a different MP faction (FBI, Seals, ISA, SDC, Militia, Mercs).

2 - The point system would be different. There would be two point systems: the normal one, as we know of, and a Scorestreak one.

3 - There would be a ""Scorestreak machine"" that would cost 1000 points to use, like the Mistery Box. Once used, it would randomly choose 3 Scorestreaks for that player to use. The first slot would select low-end scorestreaks (UAV, RC-XD, Hunter Killer, Care Package, Counter-UAV, Guardian, Hellstorm Missile), the second slot mid-end scorestreaks (Lightning Strike, Sentry Gun, Dragonfire, AGR, Stealth Chopper, Orbital VSAT) and the third high-end ones (Escort Drone, EMP Systems, Warthog, Lodestar, VTOL Warship, K9 Unit, and Swarm). The Death and War Machines are not on the list - to compensate, some streaks would be moved backwards on the list.

4 - Each zombie kill would award the player with 10 points towards the Scorestreaks. If it's a headshot kill, the player gets 15 points.

5 - Scorestreaks would work as following:

* UAV (425 Points) - Show all zombies and allies on the mini-map. Lasts 28 seconds, doing a sweep every 2 seconds.
* RC-XD (450 Points) - Works exactly like the Multiplayer counterpart. However, it explodes on contact. If it hits a wall or a zombie, it will explode and deal 5000 damage. However, if the player times it and detonates it before it hits something, it will do a massive 30,000 damage that is doubled every 10 rounds after Round 40. It is much faster than its multiplayer counterpart and has a smaller blast radius. Players are invisible to zombies while using it.
* Hunter Killer (525 Points) - Works exactly like its MP counterpart. Deals 7,000 damage on any zombie caught by the blast radius, and insta-kills the zombie that is directly hit by it and five other random zombies caught on the blast.
* Counter-UAV  (550 Points) - Disorients all zombies on the map, making them goof around and only chase players that fire or bump at them, even while using Silencers. Lasts 28 seconds.

* Guardian (600 Points) - Disorients all zombies caught on its ultrassonic wave (different of the microwaves on MP). Zombies will slow down and reach to their ears in pain. Any zombie that stays on the Guardian's radius for more than ten seconds die, awarding normal kill points to the Guardian's owner. Very fragile (zombies will destroy it with five slaps).

* Care Package (650 Points) - Same as Multiplayer, having the same chances of drops. Zombies will try to destroy it once the box hits the floor.

* Hellstorm Missile (700 Points) - Deals infinite damage if it isn't deployed. When deployed, it will deal infinite damage to the targeted zombies, and zombies caught on the blast that were not targeted will suffer damage equal to half of their health. Smaller blast radius.

* Lightning Strike (750 Points) - Each bomb deals infinite damage with a 30% smaller blast radius. However, once called, it takes five seconds for the three fighters to appear and drop the bombs.

* Sentry Gun (800 Points) - Mows down any zombie on its sights. Works exactly like the automatic turret on Kino Der Toten. Lasts for 90 seconds before turning off. If the player reaches 800 Score again, he can go to the turret and activate it again, or deploy a new turret, destroying the old one on the process.

* Dragonfire (850 Points) - Unlike the MP counterpart, it is AI-controlled. Works like a flying sentry gun with a bit lower damage. Will self-destruct once 90 seconds have passed.

* AGR (900 Points) - Behaves much like the MP counterpart. However, it fires its weapons based on the quantity of zombies it ""sees"". If it's few zombies, it will use its MG. On a medium group, it will use its missiles, and on a large one, it will fire both at the same time. It is a bit slower, and attracts zombies on a 100 ft. radius. Zombies can destroy it (blows up after taking 10 slaps from the zombies).

* Chopper (1000 Points) - Mows down zombies it sees. Will attract zombies to its victiny, making them a easier kill. Leaves after 45 seconds.

* Orbital VSAT (1100 Points) - Shows all zombies, allies, weapon spawns (as blue tracers), Mistery Box (orange trace), perks (dot with the color corresponding to the perk), and Scorestreak Machine locations on the mini-map.

* Escort Drone (1250 Points) - Same as its MP counterpart. Leaves after 45 seconds. 

* EMP Systems (1300 Points) - Freezes all zombies for 20 seconds. Their eyes stop glowing, and they stop respawning. However, they get a 10% health buff during the frozen state.

* Warthog (1400 Points) - Same as MP counterpart.

* Lodestar (1500 Points)  - Launches insta-kill missiles. Player is invisible to all zombies while using it. Leaves after 40 seconds or after 10 rockets have been launched. Player keeps invisible to all zombies after five seconds of stopping controlling it.

* VTOL Warship (1600 Points) - Also AI-controlled. Will change its location depending of how many zombies are on its vicinity. Leaves after 40 seconds.

* K9 Unit (1700 Points) - Dogs that insta-kill zombies they bite. They have the same health as a normal player without Jugg. 16 dogs can be deployed, but only 4 at once stay on the map. They leave after 90 seconds.

* Swarm (2000 Points) - Very rare. Pretty self-explanatory - multiple Hunter Killer drones that do double damage of the normal HK drone.

6 - Perk machines are modernized. Every map has Juggernog, Quick Revive, Double Tap II, and Speed Cola. The other machines are randomized, depending of the map. Each map has seven perk machines.

7 - Players can buy attachments to their guns. The attachments are on chalk drawings on the walls. Buying one will put it on the current weapon you're holding (unless it is not compatible). Maximum of 2 attachments for each gun. Attachments cost between 300 and 800 points, depending of which one. Attachments do not work like their MP counterparts for the most part.

8 - Pack-a-Punching a weapon would make it get a Cyborg Camouflage with the color depending of your character's faction (Red for SDC, blue for Seals and FBI, yellow for Militia, orange for Mercs and green for ISA). Doing the Pack-a-Punch will allow the weapon to receive one extra attachment slot, being able to have three attachments. Only modern weapons and some Wonder Weapons can be found within the game - however, all MP weapons are at disposal, be it on walls, or on the Mystery Box. Players start with a modernized version of the M1911.

9 - Each faction character has two abilities.

* FBI gets 15% discount on their Scorestreak rewards and 10% less recoil on all guns.
* Seals flinch less when hit and their weapons have a 10% faster fire rate and reload time.
* ISA gets 40% less idle sway on all weapons and can't be heard by the zombies (zombies can hear footsteps, but will not chase an ISA  operative unless they see him)
* SDC gets higher melee range and 10% more damage on all bullet-firing weapons.
* Militia can carry an extra grenade on both slots and deal 15% more explosive damage.
* Mercs get a 10% discount on all machines (perk, Pack-a-Punch, Scorestreak machine) and can carry 15% more ammo.

10 - There could be some explanation on how these operatives went on the Zombie world and must find a way to get out of that. Each map would have its objectives, which are usually very long and complicated.

1366825705.0,39,self.CODZombies,1d0u5c,Mob of the Dead Thoughts.,46,7,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1d0u5c/mob_of_the_dead_thoughts/,"Mob of the Dead is seemingly well received by the community and in my opinion MOTD is exceptional. Much has been written about the added weaponry, parts inventory, afterlife mode and so on. There are many facets to Mob of the Dead that I found interesting which have not been written about and am hoping to generate discussion on. Please share.

1. Leaked Info: One of the things that strikes me as unusual as opposed to the other zombie DLC's (Die rise, nuketown, blops1) is how much leaked info before the map became available was actually true. So many details and much of the storyline actually was leaked (shock reloading perk, deadshot, warden boss, PAP on bridge, flying to the golden gate bridge, electric chairs, afterlife mode) etc. Die Rise had many iterations of fake loading screens and bad information...I wonder why this was the case for Mob of the Dead. Hopefully Treyarch can do a better job preventing leaks in the future (although many would disagree with me). 

2. Missed Surival Maps Opportunity: Mob of the Dead would have provided for some amazing survival maps ( Docks, Golden Gate Bridge, Cell Block). It is great that Cell Block was added for Grief but BLOPS 2 lacks survival maps as opposed to BLOPS1. MOTD is amazing but the origin of zombies came from the pure survival map...Parts of Mob of the Dead would have arguably provided some of the best survival maps yet. 

3. Voice Acting: Chaz Palminteri did the best job of all the voice actors. Overall so much better than the Tranzit characters and bad ass in general. 

4. Solo Mode : Although I enjoy co op much more one of the things I found annoying about Solo previously is the max of 3 revives for a full game. Afterlife adds a very interesting element to playing solo as losing the game is no longer just three downs total. 

5. Zombie Theme: MOTD took so many elements from throughout the zombies lineage that gives it so much depth. ""Fetch me their souls"" with the three hellhound heads. Using the avogadro mechanics for an afterlife mode. Coffins as opposed to a mystery box. 

6. Future Changes: Mob of the Dead also makes me very curious about the next DLC. The graphics in MOTD are very different as well as the heads up display. I am very curious to see if many of the changes implemented in MOTD carry over into further DLC's. 

7. Perks in the future: One of the things Treyarch did at the end of BLOPS1 was to add Mule Kick to all of the previous maps. With Flopper and Mule Kick being available in Grief but both perks being shown off the docks in MOTD....I wonder if Treyarch will add these perks back to MOTD at the end of the DLC season. 

8. Ending Song: When Die Rise came out people were speculating on what the noise was when you finally lost. After Mob of the Dead came out the losing noise at the end of Die Rise is the same noise as when the Warden spawns. At the end of MOTD there is a very futuristic sounding song. The loading screen did not show any hints or tears so the end song / noises seems to be the new next DLC tease?

Me and my friends tried this out the other night and I wanted to share. The basic goal is to survive in the spawn room as long as you can. This only works with all four players, all willing to cooperate/communicate.
Near the end of round one, one person keeps their zombie at the window. Everybody buys the M14 and Olympia. Now, while somebody watches the zombie, the other three people leave, turn on power and then hit the bank. Buy perks (Jugg, Tombstone, Quick Revive, Speed Cola) PaP both wall weapons, get galvanuckles, semtex and claymores (other option is acquiring these items after building up points incase you dont want to withdrawal a lot/dont have money in bank). Come back to Depot, and let the other person do the same. 
Obviously keep the 750 point door closed and the game is setup. Hold down your window and buy ammo when needed. For a little backup incase of a breach, have your turbine down near you (away from the door) during the rounds. During a breach, it'll buy you some time as they will go after the turbine first. Before long you'll have deadshot and reinforced windows too. It's a fun, different way to play TranZit and you can easily get to high 20s/30s doing it. We made it to 36 the first time trying it. Try it out if you want to change it up!

In Shi No Numa that guy on the radio says The Giant must be contained at all costs. Everybody assumed he meant Der Riese ( Der Riese means The Giant). Now that we have a ""Giant"", we now know ol' Trollarch pulled a Tricky Vic. Prepare for mind melt: Der Riese = The Giant. Der Riese = Location (Possibly given the name 'The Giant"" to throw enemies who acquire their intel off track.) The Giant = Well, it literally means The Giant this time.

So here's what I think. In WW1 German scientists engineered The Giant. They meant it to be a super soldier. The Giant somehow gets lost or into the wrong hands or something. Fast forward to WW2 now. German scientists have made a facility named 'Der Riese' (the giant) where try to make super soldiers using element 115 after their beloved Giant, which was a 'prototype' super soldier, which we don't know what happened to it and/or To throw people who find intel regarding The Giant off track. Some American agents find intel, and manage to learn the difference of The Giant and Der Riese. They believe the Germans still have the Giant somewhere and send agents to spy and learn intel about the Giant. One agent (Peter) goes to Shi No Numa and gets a radio transmission from another one (lets call him Bob). Bob learns just how dangerous the Germans could become once they find or fix or whatever the Giant and get it back in their hands. He warns Peter that it must be contained at all costs because it could potentially win the war for the Germans.

I went to the roof and was doing well with the Spork when I think my buddy Ray got me down.  I went to the tape and after fast forwarding 3 hrs of footage I realized this epic round didn't make the cut.  WTF.  Anyway my epic tale didn't end there.  With no perks or shield I was on the roof with the Voice, Ray, Retriever, and the Spork.


Plan A Get Jug.  I decided I needed all zombies behind me so I only killed those that I needed to and horded the rest up behind me.  From there I used the voice to get through the infirmary.  Noticing the Voice takes 2 hits to kill, I grabbed double tap on my way to jug.  


With Jug in place I went for a shield and figured the acid trap would speed things up.  Not the case.  The Shield did add comfort and possibly a little too much confidence.

Plan C Speed Cola.  This is where my confidence was too high.  I turned on the fan trap and bought Speed only to turn around and notice that an entire swarm of zombies had spawned in the Warden's den.  The voice got me to the trap and my army crawl got me out while my 3 spectators assumed I was good as dead.  I really wanted to see how the entire swarm spawned in that fast; theatre mode where are you?


With death dodged I grabbed the new Cherry perk and headed to the docks to spawn my team by jugs and Tommy.  Using the sniper tower I noticed the docks were not a safe place for the last man of a 4 player game.  I used the acid shower a couple more times and went back to the roof.  Using up just about all of the Weasel's ammo.


With 4 crawlers and 3 slow walkers I fueled up the plane and asked the team what they wanted.  They wanted me to replace my guns in the box and PaP.  I didn't want to fight Brutus now so I suggested completed the EE and calling it a night.  


The Weasel has his revenge.  Against 3 inmates armed with M1911s and no perks I was ready to break the cycle.  Ray's Porter did nothing to my first victim so it was down to the low ammo Voice to end the game.  Why is there no cut scene when you finish the EE?  I understand when the Weasel dies the cycle continues but when I finally won one I hoped for something.

Also, the concept of the story of MotD - reliving death in an infinite cycle - which can be associated with Hell. I mean, what's more nightmarishly hellscapey than literally dying over and over again forever? People have been wondering why the zombie's eyes are red, too, and with all the previous reasons, I think that the color, which we can pretty much agree is the color related to Hell, is reason enough to make me believe that the Devil may play a part in this map. One last thing, the Campaign team was said to have worked on this map. That may add to the likeliness that they *would* twist the zombie storyline however they wanted, really.

Despite which side you're on, Richtofen says that Samantha still has his body. So what does this mean? The O4 are still alive. And not on the Moon.

""But Tak, how did they get off the moon by themselves and NOT die?!""

Well, they didn't get off by themselves. After Richtofen got bored and found some new toys to play with (N4/CIA/CDC) he teleported Dempsey, Takeo, Nikolai, and Samantha somewhere safe and free of zombies. Agartha

But why? Simply because if he is to be in control of the zombies, he wants to do so in his body. Therefore it must be safe and not dead. If we think logically, there should be no way whatsoever there are zombies in Agartha. None. Therefore, it's the perfect place. 

So why send Dempsey, Tak, and Nikolai along with Samantha? They aren't important to getting his body back, you're correct. However we must still remember that Samantha is still a young girl at heart, so she needs babysitters so Richtofen can play with his new toys and not worry about her so much.

[Buried spoilers, you can read most of this until I start talking about Buried]

Note: Before I start this I'd like to say I'm doing all of this on an iPod so if there are spelling/grammar mistakes or weird formatting I'm sorry.

  With the new zombies map just released I feel like we all need to be on the same page with everything and see where we're going in terms of zombies. First we should look at the previous maps in BO2 and how they will relate in the future.

  Tranzit and Die Rise are probably my least favorite zombies maps. For me they have very little replay ability. They don't have a really and dark tones that BO1 provided us with. Map designs were not only linear but provided no room for back tracking(you could sometimes but it would be tedious). The story really didn't provide us with much except for us to activate these Towers for Maxis or Richtofen. It was a bit of a let down. 

  Then came Mob of the Dead. A map that returns to Nazi Zombies roots with its extremely dark tones we see(PlayTheGame has a really good video going through all examples of this in the map). It's layout is much more open than the previous maps, providing us multiple was to get to places and allows to easily backtrack. We even see the return of traps, while still keeping buildables around. The campaign team showed us hope for the rest of dlc. Story-wise it doesn't relate too much compared to CotD however it was original in its Easter Egg and provided us with something different. 

  Finally, Buried. By far my favorite BO2 zombies map. We get the return of the new crew and two Easter Eggs that push forward the story far beyond what I was imagining. The map itself is complex with all it's different routes but still allows people to move freely about the map, albeit it requires some time. Now the new weapons are rather incredible and give some freshness back to Zombies. I'm so glad we finally get a new secondary grenade that is useful. We also get a ton of new features and options available that can help immensely.

  Above all, the Easter Eggs are probably the most exciting about this new map. At the end of Maxis side we learn that he is willing to destroy to human race just to get to Agartha to find his child. Many call him a bad guy, power hungry he may be he's still looking for his child and hoping she's still alive. Richtofen is considered the lesser of two evils at this time. He's power hungry and he gets total control if you help him. Right now he seems more rational and less of a threat. Now it's interesting to see what Treyarch is going to do with these storyline progressions. 

  My personal theory is that the new crew will start out at ""The Rift"" in the next map and travel to Argatha to either find Samantha and stop Maxis or help Richtofen in his grand scheme. 

 Regardless, the Zombies team has brought me hope for what's to come. If you have anything you'd like to add please comment, I'll make sure to reply.

For the record this sub is amazing! I'm totally ecstatic to have come across it!

I've been an avid gamer, but the zombie aspect of COD never intrigued me till BO2. ( I saw my bf running trains on TranZit in the town and told myself I could do better than that! BTW I now hold the record on both systems in our house! Huzzah ;3 ) 

Anywho, I was wondering if going back and playing the other maps would be worth it. I see lots of posts about EE from previous ones, but I mean would it be worth it to get a better grasp on a storyline?

Honestly, I dabbled in a game or two on Ascension ( which I thought was artistically amazing ) but then Call of the Dead ruined it for me.

I digress.

I thought to myself that this was going to be a good game as we were all decent players, but oh how wrong I was.

Things were going smoothly up until round ~15. I decided to upgrade my Galil when a sudden EMP grenade cockblocked my upgrade. I looked up to the bar and I seen the Shotgun rank player looking down at me, and I also heard his screams of laughter through the tv. 

I was fairly pissed but I had a good bit of points and a ray gun so I was alright.

But there's more.

He did this 2 more times to the other players and I was getting even more infuriated. 

Then at round 18 he turned off the Jugg and Tombstone perks. One of the players had died the last round and was therefore unable to recover his tombstone and ended up rage quitting.

Finally at round 20 he got to me again.

It was just me and him left as our other teammate just got downed and we were upstairs in the bar.

I was busy shooting the zombies and he was doing absolutely nothing, just standing at the hole in the wall.

I eventually ran out of ammo, and you guessed it, he blocked me from escaping and caused me to down.

He was not finished just yet.

He kept a crawler and literally WALKED around town. This went on for ~15 minutes. He then just left the game.

IMO, the worst thing about zombies is being limited to what you can buy. It makes games boring in high rounds.**

* Pack-a-Punch can be used on a gun an unlimited amount of times, each time making the weapon better, not just adding a scope or attachment.

* Pack-a-Punch works with equipment such as monkey bombs.

*  You can buy all of the perks in a match without being limited to 4 slots.

* You can buy perks multiple times to upgrade the perk's abilities. Imagine buying Stamin-up a 2nd time and having the ability to run forever, or buying Speed Cola again to make you swap weapons faster.

* A Zombies find-a-match system where you can search only for people with Mics in.

As the German scientist watched the blood from the neck of the man he had hung with his own parachute drip to the ground the voices started to grow louder ""*It must be done, you are chosen; now do as you were destined* **She is coming**""

As soon as those words hit his brain he was snapped out of the euphoric state brought on by the bloodshed; he had to wake them if he were to succeed in his plan and make the voices stop.  
He began running as fast as he could to the small prison area set up in this swamp of death as those native Japanese called it: He had to hurry if he wanted any chance, the voice repeated what it had said earlier but *louder and louder and LOUDER*, Richtofen screamed out as his head burst with pain stemming from his temples

""Wunderbar!"" he screamed out as he made it to the bamboo cell and opened the gate as a child opens his christmas presents while the smell of decay and sadness leaked out  
""HEY who the fuck are you?"" came an American voice from deep inside the cell, Richtofen quietly whispered something to himself involving the words ""Painful death"" and ""Farm animals""  
""Hello, would you kindly let us out"" Came a thick Japanese accent from inside, Richtofen quietly thought of how he thought this one turned out the best  
""I see you are all awake, i have come to rescue you as it seems we have some *visitors*"" The nazi stated as the sounds of many feet approaching came to the ears of the imprisoned  
""Now get **OUT**""  
""We would if this fucking bear of a man would wake up already!"" came the voice of the american once more  
""Ugh i forgot his needs"" Richtofen quietly murmured under his breath as he drew a large bottle of vodka from within his coat  
Suddenly there was a crash and Richtofen was on the ground as the bottle was wrestled from him by 200 pounds of pissed off hungover Russian ""Give me my **VODKA**"" Nikolai screamed out as the nazi let go of the bottle and the angry russian downed it in one gulp; by this time however the other two supersoldiers had stepped out of there makeshift prison and gathered weapons  
""What now kraut?"" asked the american
""One thing"" said Richtofen as he picked up a strange gun made of copper with lightning riding up it's barrel ""Enjoy the *slaughter*""

In the cell across from that is the first skull. Throw your tomahawk to collect it. Then, go to the docks, and by the mystery box location, there is a wooden pole next to the ship. The skull is on that. The next skull is by Jugg. Face Jugg and turn around and look up. There is a light post. Jump and throw your tomahawk.
Next is on the roof. Go past the plane into the front left corner. The skull is on the closest roof. Last, in the warden's office, go to the window next to speed cola. The skull is on the flickering telephone pole. If you have trouble locating the skulls, go into afterlife and they will glow blue. but they are invisible when not in afterlife unless someone in afterlife shocks them.

have done the plane cycle and seen all the perks.




The map starts out like you would guess , a room with 4 windows.
New though is that you can actually choose your character.
In the ''after life''.
The after life is a cool feauture which is needed for simple puzzles for getting plane parts, powering perks , and reviving yourself.
It isn't overpowered as you only get one every round.



And Hey , The box got an upgrade!
It looks like it came straight from hell.
The maps itself is small corridors and some open area's 
(And a real good camping place at the docks.)
The perks are great and there is again a tease at PHD flopper.
Non accesible ofcourse.




My opinion on the map is that it is great, i love how they made the Escape plan story more in the spotlight and not just a background story which was hard to do.

According to the Call of Duty Wiki, Albert Arlington says ""Nikolai. Nikolai. Nikolai. Nikolai. Why do I keep hearing that name?"" when killing zombies with the ray gun. Now, I originally put it in the back of my mind, assuming that it was just a nice little nod to the fact that the O4 exists, but recently, I've been thinking a bit more deeply into it. If I recall correctly (though I can't seem to find the source), the original four were confirmed to be in the Aether. If this were true, it would be possible for them to take a living form on Earth, as [Richtofen does in Mined Games.](/spoiler) Since they are not in such positions of power as Richtofen or Maxis, they likely would not transition as well, hence them coming in as demonic dogs. Though most of what they said would be heard as dog growling, some words might've been somewhat audible. Since Nikolai tends to speak about himself in the third person frequently (i.e. ""Nikolai needs ammo!""), Weasel might've been able to make the word out, hence him hearing the name. I know this is kind of a ridiculous concept with little evidence, but there has to be some reason Weasel is hearing Nikolai's name. What seem to be minor throwaway quotes have turned out to be relevant and important to the story (i.e. the quotes in Ascension when Pack-A-Punching in which the original four begin to regain their memory).

Does it now seem like Maxis is the bad guy? When you complete Maxis's Easter Egg, he says he will destroy the world, and Richtofen says, ""You're ruining my plans,"" or something like it. When Richtofen wins, he says he is going to use the universe as a plaything, and destroys Maxis for trying to undermine him. 
If you look at the Zombies [Main Story Line](http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Zombies_\(mode\)/Story#Main_Story), Maxis sacrificed true science in the name of military funding, and Richtofen just wanted to truly help the world. He contacts the M.P.D, and suddenly, that desires amplifies to the point of insanity. But all he still really wants is to perform scientific experiments. As shown by his dialogue about playthings. It just seems like Richtofen wants to science and interact with the universe. This just becomes more convenient by the fact that he somewhat becomes a god. Maxis wants to become god to destroy the world and be with Samantha. Clearly, you* can* get to Agartha without destroying the world, because Richtofen sent the O4 there, and says he's gonna do it again when his Easter Egg is completed. This makes Richtofen seem rather noble. He was just trying to get to Agartha, get his body back, and experiment with the whole universe as his lab bench. Maxis wants  selfish things, and to destroy the world for no apparent reason.

Maybe not the best gun, but a gun nonetheless. Think about Kino Der Toten. There's a gun or two in every room. Now, in BO2, it's different. Since the maps are larger, there's a lot larger space in between placement of guns, meaning after respawning, it is a lot harder to get to a gun to survive. They are few and far between.

Now, some people don't even know about this place (surprising, I know) but it is absolutely glorious. Here are some reasons that i choose choose this place over any other place.
Pros!
1. It has the m16
2. The m16 has the highest damage out of all the wall weapons
3. It is an assault rifle, meaning the second highest headshot multiplier (second to snipers)
4. The pack a punched version has a noob tube attachment which is excellent for insta kill (and should only be used then). Because its huuuuge blast radius takes out your whole crowd in one hit (with insta kill). This means amazing ammo conservation.
5. Big place to run, If you want, you could run two trains with two people in that tunnel.
6. Potentially infinite ammo if you don't miss all the time (pack a punched)
Cons!
1. Very secluded. You won't be able to help your teammates if they go down. (Only an issue in multiplayer of course)
2. The bus can kind of be interruptive but it's very easy to work around it
3. The weapon placement is kind of sketchy because the platform is a little skinny and you could potentially get trapped. Just play it smart. Wait till you have a crowd then go so none spawn in front of you.

What do you guys think about it? Any comments?

Edit: As Zyner mentioned, if you have that rammer thing on the front of your bus, you could use it to kill your whole crowd if you time it right.

Seeing as first Mob of the Dead, and then Buried, both nerfed training (Mob of the Dead made it more difficult, particularly with more than one player, and Buried came damn near to making it unviable, although that's more because camping became better, not training harder) and Origins is based in trenches. I believe that there will be little room to maneuver and few areas to camp it out, (see: Giant robot stamping on campers heads) so my personal prediction is that Origins will be more of a run and gun style map, with emphasis on the tank.

Thoughts?

P.S. The smaller Zombies in robot suits have Iron Crosses on them, they're German designed (probably the larger ones as well seeing as the teasers hinted towards this).

I was playing town survival with 2 randoms, both in party chat. So we couldn't communicate. Anyways, we got to round 17, and I had revived them both a number of times, so it got to the point where they were useless, and had no points to spend on weapons or perks. During round 17 they both planned to trap me upstairs in the bar so that the game ends. They were successful. So I sent them a message to switch to game chat, so we could play again. They assumed I didn't know they were trolling. I was a bit upset that they found fun in being stupid. This time though, they said they'd play seriously. And they did. I let them get almost all the kills. All I did was run around with jug and stamin-up, letting them do the killing. They felt real good. By round 14, both of them were ready to down themselves to get all the perks when they'd re-spawn the next round. Both had PaP's weapons. And so they went down, with their tombstones ready. My time came: to waste their time like they did mine. I purposely killed myself and the game ended. The tone in their voices was golden. Sheer disappointment. My job was done, and it felt good. They learned their lesson. 

Another time this one kid (on nuketown) would keep bringing his train to mine (I was behind one of the houses), creating a huge cluster. And he'd laugh every time I'd tell him to stop. Sad thing was that he'd be the one to go down, and I wouldn't revive him. I'd throw a monkey and teabag him endlessly. 

Anyone else here encounter trolls who want to give you a hard time? I feel like I get unlucky quite frequently. I hate trolls, but I will find a way to give them what they deserve.

The answer, like all other plot holes in the zombies trilogy, is time travel. 

Richtofen, or another entity, realizing no matter what they do, the current events make a victory improbable. Or, perhaps in Richtofens case, he realizes his one insanity. 

In a final, desperate attempt to change the future or perhaps seeking redemption, said entity sends message back in time to his younger self, telling him what he must do. 
Said entity tell the young original crew that in order to truly find redemption, to save themselves from eternal damnation and to save the souls and livelihood of the innocent, they must change what is to be. 

They must fight their way through the bunker at Nacht der Unto ten and save the Marines. 

They must travel back to Verrukt and save Dempsey (Version 1, time line 1) and his comrades. 

They must go to Shi no Numa and rescue Peter. 

They must travel back to Der Riese and uncover the truth of the giant. 

They must discover the truth about the Theater of the DAMNED. 

They must go to Ascension and free Gersch and the souls of the Russian research team. 

They must travel into the mystical place of Shangri-la and unravel the ways of time. 

They must go onto the Moon and remove Richtofen from having a chance to take his power. 

And then. 

They must destroy the final, greatest, and most  temporally out of place machinations the organization known as Group 935 can offer.

Nothing to very minimal information so far has been confirmed, but all we have are clues towards the next map and yet all we can do is just wait and guess.

What we do know is that we could possibly be seeing the return of the original 4, last seen on Moon. Many rumors about the next map have been tossed around. We have all heard the theories of maps like The Dark Side of the Moon, World War I era, Paris, agartha etc. The rumour that got me interested the most was The Dark Side of the Moon, because if you think about it, the original four must need to get off the moon some how, and this is where the ""Reverse No-Man's Land"" comes into play.

As most of us know, The no man's land from moon, is at the very beginning of the game, and can also be referred to as round 0. Infinite zombie spawn, and your only way of escape is through the teleporter. The idea that I had is exactly the same thing, except, instead of trying to escape area 51, you are trying to escape the moon.

This is why it is reversed: You are doing the same thing, but you are escaping the moon, as opposed to going there.

This could actually take place on the exact teleporter spot as seen in the moon map, where mule kick is, and above the M.P.D

Although the telporter links to the telporter in Area 51, I am sure that it could be configured to send the crew elsewhere, perhaps through Maxis giving them instructions, or maybe even an accident (Der Riese - Kino Der Toten. I am sure that Richtofen did not mean to send the crew THAT FAR into the future: The Wunderwaffe overloaded the teleporter.)

However, this is the catch: When you spawn on the Moon's No man's land, that is the only time you can go there. You are trapped in that room with the telporter and that is it. You can only escape through the telporter. I thought of this because it would add to the effect of the telporter possibly malfunctioning.

As a side note, this could be the perfect opportunity for treyarch to troll us further: If you are in that place for one time only, then maybe, they would put PhD flopper where mule kick is. This would be a troll, as you would have to gather the points for it, buy it then leave. If you get downed, then that's it. You've lost it; as there is no way of getting it back.

Anyway, I just thought that this would be a cool idea to implement anyway. So what do you guys think about this, and how could this be improved further?",,False,self,t5_2sal9,False,,deadshot,True,t3_1j9zgc,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1j9zgc/idea_for_next_map_reverse_nomans_land/,

I think it'll be cool, I liked when they did that for mule kick because it added a new way to play all of the maps and I think it would be interesting. Imagine if it negates fire damage in TranZit (probably unlikely if they were to add it, but maybe it would make TranZit more popular).


Here are some location ideas I had in mind:

**TranZit** - Upper floor of the small house at the Farm (Where jugg is on Farm Survival) 

**Bus Depot** - Where quick revive would be located on TranZit (if they were to add it in Bus Depot)

**Town** - Semtex room; across from Double Tap II/Box Location

**Farm** - Bottom floor inside the Barn, below Double Tap II

**Nuketown** - Self explanatory (one of the perk/PaP spawns)

**Die Rise** - In the Buddha room, maybe by the closed elevator

**Mob of the Dead** - where it is located in Cell Block Grief, library (right next to spawn area)

**Cell Block** - Already in Cell Block (located in the library, spawn area in MOTD)

**Buried** - Maybe in the Barn right when you drop down from Quick Revive

**Borough** - Same as Buried


Again just an idea, what do you guys think?

And ya I realize that maybe to some people the perk isn't as useful as everyone makes it out to be. I personally enjoy it and think it would be pretty neat for Treyarch to do this.

No two players can have the same guns, and if lost they don't go back into the box, but back into the Safehouse.

However, the only way to get ammo for these weapons would be to get a Max Ammo or Pack-a-Punch them.

(Steps)
Spawn in the starting room and attempt to make about 1,500 bucks (stay on round 1 if you can). Take the freight (spawn room) elevator down, and jump across. Grab your PaPed gun, and withdraw your 6k. Open up the power room, power up, and ride the elevator to the roof. Once you are on the roof, jump over to the Bz3r/Trample steam crafting room. Jump down onto the pink mattresses in the next building over. Go down the elevator shaft and buy the Galvanuckles.
Now you are on round 1 with a pack a punched gun and the Galvanuckles. Reimbursing yourself for your initial Galvanuckles purchase should be incredibly easy. Now just train/camp wherever you want, and make sure to come back and put the money in.

**Further Explanation**

(Setting up the game)

You should probably set this strategy up in multiple games.
The set-up game should focus on pack-a-punching your gun. I would recommend pack-a-punching the AK74u because its close to the fridge, and it serves as a decent weapon. Once you pack-a-punch, simply drop it in the fridge, and its up to you whether you want to continue the game, or end the round and head into the real money making phase.

(Start making the money)

So follow the steps mentioned in the simple explanation above. Now I would recommend camping the area near the dragon, because there are only two ways they can come at you (the paths dead ahead of you or the small window behind you).
If you want to train Buddha room, that is an excellent idea. I would just recommend purchasing the AN-94 first, so you will have a killer gun to pack a punch down the road.

**Most important note**

Don't hang on to your money for too long! Many people here can tell you they thought they had it in the bag but got caught off guard and lost it all. Try to put it away ASAP.

1371933664.0,23,self.CODZombies,1gvg0w,My thoughts on Black Ops 2 Zombies so far,37,14,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1gvg0w/my_thoughts_on_black_ops_2_zombies_so_far/,"**Tranzit**
Tranzit more or less met the requirements of a basic zombies map, and just spread it out, introducing the fog and desmends (or whatever they're called). The easter egg was the major focus of the map other than that, which is fine. It was what it was, *Green Run* was a nice introduction to zombies for those who didn't play previous games, and had a similar but intriguing environment for veterans.  

**Let me be clear; I enjoyed Tranzit,**

I did not like the fact that Black Ops 2 featured *only* tranzit as a major game mode. Even with the addition of Nuketown, (which I think is a great map, but more of a bonus-map type feel), the game lacks variety. Grief and survival take place within the world of green run, and frankly I didn't like it. 


**Die Rise** 
Die Rise was a great map, and challenged just about everyone... at first. Once you got a feel for it, it was the easiest map in the game. You could camp in the Buddha room, train on the roof, not to mention  the free perk system. The only downside was *whose-who*, a terrible perk in my opinion, at least for that map. It may have been more suitable in previous maps, like on BO1. Kino would be awesome to have whose-who on, but Die Rise just doesn't suit it. 

Anyway, Die rise was an interesting map, there wasn't too much to do, but hey we all had fun (for the most part). Perma perks were back, which was cool. A little annoyed that there was no Der Reise reference or anything....


**Mob of the Dead** 
Mob of the Dead was the **coolest f**king* map. It introduced an entirely new set of characters, in a real life setting, with new guns, weapons, motives, and features in general. An entirely new map, very refreshing. And the newness starts just as you begin, in the *afterlife* which had never been in any map before. The afterlife was also the method of powering perks, instead of just flipping a lever. Brutus was a homage to George and COTD, as was the map in itself really. I liked MOTD, but again, a little easy to train, and there weren't really any bad guns. The RPG I guess, but you could easily replace it. The Blundergat and VW were nuts op, but who cares, it was sick. 

I guess individually I like each map a lot, but the game leaves something to be desired, and I'm annoyed that it has to come through DLC. I wish games had completeness when you bought them, and then they added cool stuff... I wish BLOPS2 had more maps to begin with, even if they were unrelated to the story. I feel like Treyarch sold out on us, but are using the money to make a good game. 

What do you guys think?",,False,self,t5_2sal9,False,,phdflopper,True,t3_1gvg0w,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1gvg0w/my_thoughts_on_black_ops_2_zombies_so_far/,
1371487994.0,26,self.CODZombies,1giwhu,[Long Theory] The Unusual Suspect is in control.,32,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1giwhu/long_theory_the_unusual_suspect_is_in_control/,"I'll get back to the title later on but let's look at things like this. Call of the Dead presented an alternative future in our current zombies timeline. In that future, the zombie outbreak isn't as bad and Samantha is in control still. Everybody knows that already. Now Mob of the Dead may be presenting an alternative past. One where the're's a rift in time, which is why all the perks except electric cherry aren't actually on the map but stuck in a time rift. This is another theory that has been explored as some people already know. But the question is why? Just to back track a bit, look at what happened on Die Rise. We know Richtofen has the ability to teleport people. He's also in control of the zombies, so why would we need to do Easter eggs to help him? Whatever we're building is a time machine. 



We've had some time travel previously but this will be on a larger scale. Something that can teleport to any time period with large groups of people or even buildings themselves. Richtofen and Maxis both know this because Nacht Der Untoten was teleported from Germany to Green Run but they both want it to gain control of the zombies. This also might explain why it is called ""The Prototype.""



But wait, Richtofen is already in control of the zombies. Yes, he is, for now. What if he somehow loses control and he knows he's going to so he has a massive time machine built for some reason to prevent it. Maxis also knows this, and is planning to do the same but this time finally be in control of his zombie army. 



How would Richtofen lose control though? Remember, the small faint voice that sounds like Richtofen on Die Rise begging for help. The reason he wants help is because he has grown lonely and having all the power isn't as good as he thinks. He would decide to give someone else control of the zombies, but he couldn't just give it to anyone. He would have to give it to the one person he actually likes. Who is the one person he likes? Who would he trust? Who is the least likely of all the characters we know of to control the zombies? Nikolai.



What? Where did that come from? Yes Nikolai. Richtofen misses him and never had a problem with him. He even speaks to him as if he is a child and he would figure Nikolai would be too drunk to cause any real havoc with the zombies. He gives him some control but Nikolai is smarter than he appears and betrays Richtofen, in a Julius Caesar type of way. But Nikolai doesn't betray Richtofen in the present, but in the past. Past as in during the 1930s. 



So Nikolai is Brutus? In Mob of the Dead, Nikolai is in control of the undead, while Richtofen is in control of afterlife. In afterlife, the characters have more knowledge of what is occurring and that they are dead. But while they are alive, Nikolai is in control and Weasel hints towards this with his quote about Nikolai. When the cycle continues, they all die, realizing Nikolai is in control where they overthrow his control. When the cycle is broken, Weasel still lives. For some reason Nikolai needs Weasel to live and that is the reason the zombies do not attack Weasel during the Easter egg. Brutus' was created by Nikolai to prevent the crew from succeeding. This is why he locks the perks, the box ect. Knowing that the Bridge is where the rift in time is supposed to occur Nikolai spawns in more Brutuses to insure that they fail. Richtofen is the reason the perks are on the map as well as the box, and this isn't the first time power was required to aid Richtofen. 



But there's no way this all could happen? This may have been planned all along. One of the best ways to deceive people is to have a decoy. The decoy is Russman. The DLC names might spell F.E.A.R. R.U.S.S leading people to believe it means Russman, but russ is also a nickname for a Russian person, pronounced ruhs. Russman was named that to purposely throw us off. Think about it, if Nikolai, a stereotypical Russian, during the rise of Communism were in control of zombies, what color would their eyes be?

I sometimes get cornered in bad places trying to help teammates and when I am surrounded I crouch then stand then crouch to buy reload time to shoot my way out. It works 9/10 times, which has improved my games insanely. The 1/10 times is because I melee mid reload. The crouching method has also improved my ability to revive people much better than the revive and shoot method. I run up, revive, and once a first zombie hits me or my revive bar makes it 2/3 the way I crouch. It causes the next few zombie hits to miss. I have been able to revive my entire team multiple times past round 30 with so many zombies around it's just stupid I even try. Over the past weeks crouching has become second nature, and has greatly improved my game play since first trying it. I am wondering if anyone else practices this or has something to add to continually improve this method?

There have been many proposals of this prior and not 1 has actually happened, I intend to break this trend and have something fun started for our community. Please up vote for visibility. 



Let me start by making it clear this is not for any reward at the moment, this is for the spirit of the game and bragging rights here in our community. I will restrict this to the continental US (PST-East). This will be to help schedule matches between our time zones, set up teams and get the ball rolling quickly. Sign ups are here so feel free to voice your opinions, input and concerns. Last day to sign up is 12:01am this Thursday the 30th.


Disclaimer: this will be the first of hopefully a weekly community game night that I would like to start with our community. To all our members out side of the US, the idea is that this gets the ball rolling and sets up a successful system for tournaments and therefore we can expand it further in order to include more people. This will be for the XBOX 360. 

Please put your input wether you would prefer 4v4 or 2v2.
Thanks

EDIT: using glitches is an automatic disqualification. Lets keep it civil, no using the pile up glitch near PaP or the ledge by wardens office.

It just added to all the mystery, and made it all a little creepier. I also prefer the maps that could be traversed completely on foot, and had less perk-a-cola machines.
This is just me, and I do enjoy the new maps, but I feel like some of them take too long to really get going. 

Also: Hellhounds, when did these guys stop being cool? I get that maybe 3arc wants to shake it up a little, but these guys were awesome, and provided some challenge, enough to make you move, but not get you killed if you have some skill. Plus the glitches with these guys were pretty funny.

And if not changing map styles, how about reusing some of the old awesome wonder weapons? The Ray gun has been around forever, but what about bringing back the Wunderwaffe or the Thundergun? Even the Winter's Howl was pretty fun, and the Wave Gun was B-E-A-Utiful. Maybe Gersch's or Matroyshka's. Some of the newer ones kinda blow...

Anyone out there agree that, despite being smaller and having less features, the older maps may have been the better maps?

My team and I have made it very far in Richtofen's Easter Egg. Click off if you do not want to see, but we could really use some suggestions.


The easter egg can be done by following these steps:


* Find all the parts to the Guillotine and build it
* Charge up all four red orbs with the paralyzer
* Knock down the floating purple lantern with a frag
* Charge up the lantern by killing ghosts
* Place the lantern on top of the rooftop
* Decipher the code using a tic-tac toe cipher
* Place a time bomb on the guillotine
* Galvaknuckle the signs in the correct order
* Run and touch the blue orb of energy (wish) that pops out of the sign. You need to keep touching it until it appears at the guillotine and before it disappears.
* Kill zombies near the guillotine. Capture 5 souls.
* After doing so, use the time bomb.
* You will then be sent to infinity mode and **must find some kind of switch**. We are stuck here. Zombies are invincible but can be killed with buildables.
* You can return to infinite mode by getting a Max Ammo and placing and using a new time bomb on the guillotine.

UPDATE: 10:54 (PST) -

* We found the bodies of our characters in infinity mode. You need to search them and eventually find a switch
* You can then add the switch to the guillotine
* Levers are then added to the doors in the maze
* We are currently trying to find the order.


~~So far, in infinite mode, we have tried:~~

~~- Paralyzing the switch in the witch's house~~

~~- to touch/galvaknuckle/hold X on the switch in the witch's house~~

~~- to hit the power switch~~

~~- to hit the bells scattered around the map~~

~~- Looking around the map for a lantern~~

~~- to get the witch to play the piano~~

~~- to re-activate the signs to get another wisp~~

~~- hitting the dartboard~~

~~- taking the portal back to spawn~~

~~- using Huck to kill zombies near the guillotine~~

~~(We will continue to update as we continue our attempts. As of 6:26 PST, we still have come up with nothing)~~

~~All of this to no avail. Any hints or suggestions?~~

-if you hold your turbine out you can knife/punch twice as fast.
if you knife a desmond twice before it jumps on you, then you can kill it. This makes running through the fog 10000x easier. You can also build windows while holding the turbine out. This can help immensly on the bus.

edit: this also works with: the trample steam, electric fence, and turret

-Do not knife the bus driver.Ever. You can rush the bus driver without pissing him off by repeatedly jumping in the bus. Also, if you knife the bus driver it makes him more likely to try to leave you at the next stop. Ex: he will wait for you to drop down to the power then immediately leave. Or he will sit there and wait and wait as the zombies tear the bus apart to get to you.

-You can move while reviving others and you can also push y/triangle to pull out your gun and shoot while you revive them. If someone gets downed next to the bus, you can stay in the bus and revive them, even if the bus drives away with you on it.

-lastly, **The hatch goes on the diner, NOT on the bus.** Don't be an asshole by cutting off galvaknuckles.

Size is obviously an issue, among other things, and I think with just a few adjustments they could really shine as standalone maps.

Bus Depot:

Obviously this one I don't wanna touch too much because its supposed to be hard and basic. Only thing I would do is open up the doors that you use the turbine on in TranZit, at 750 each (or 1000/1250 to open both? Suggestions?), and put a mystery box spawn in there just so it has somewhere to move, and it'll be even more difficult if it moves in there.

Diner(Should it be made into a standalone survival):

Again, turbine shed really needs to be opened up, and roof access. Roof would have PaP. Replace the assault shield buildable spot with a perk, as well as one in the garage, turbine shed, speed cola where it always is, then one just up against a car somewhere or on the roof.

Mystery box spawns- fit one in diner? And the default spot.  

Wall weapons- mp5, across from the climb up spot to get on roof, across from the window in the back door of the garage, on the column holding up the now die sign, move galvas to the little electric box on the roof across from where it is now.

Farm:

Open the fence and put PaP out there, or tombstone/staminup/another wall weapon, or leave it empty for training, whatever, if you wanna keep the ""No PaP"" thing on farm. 

More wall weapons if we're not gonna get PaP. Another on each barn floor, one on the lower floor of the farmhouse, one on the chicken coop- hopefully not going to overboard here with spots.

Town:

Oh my god this one could be so much. My ideas are kinda gonna trounce the ""Few Wall Weps on Town"" thing but oh well.

Areas: Okay so open the PaP in TranZit area up. Maybe make the two doors buyable instead of blow up. (Again, 750 for one, 1000/1250 for both, which would you all prefer?) 

Wall weapon ideas: Remington, M16, B23R, claymores, AK74u. Wall spots: in the back area between PaP in the bar, in the PaP vault, in the back Safety Deposit Box area between the vault and the Bank itself, in the bank. 

Move PaP to its usual spot in TranZit and move jug to the middle to keep the whole ""really valuable thing in the huge lava pit"" thing. Put a box spawn where jugg was just to add variety.

Instead of relatively open spaces, Die Rise places you in a crumbling skyscraper. Its much more claustrophobic than Tranzit, consisting almost entire of tight hallways, many of which have holes allowing in them allowing zombies to attack from above. You can use the elevator to move around, though doing so can be... err... risky, and usually pieces of the building break in such way that you can leap between sections.Just like Tranzit, taking the time to learn the level will be paramount in Die Rise. Run around a corner too fast and you might fall to your death, and you'll need to save your precious resources to purchase access to new parts of the world. A ton of parts are scattered about the building, though my team and I never managed to find a work bench.On top of the undead legions, you'll also face a deadly new minion. They look similar to goblin-like enemies that lash out at you in the fog on Tranzit, only they come during specific waves, and can do short teleports around the environment.

So I go on the Internet and start reading about it, and, as a total cinephile, I was thinking ""Hmm, this could be a nifty movie if done right."" But I didn't take the idea seriously, 'twas merely a thought.

But a few nights ago after some heated zombies it was like...4AM and I couldn't sleep well, so I busted out my phone and started reading all about the storyline in-detail and thinking how it could be put together as a film, just for a goof. I tried to think of how the story could be given more depth or background, using what was there and thinking of how to flesh out a lot of the details and characters. I've only thought up the first few scenes, and its fun to sort of think about it in my head when I'm bored but I haven't actually written anything, lol. The hardest part would be balancing the tone between the dark and light hearted. Zombies is undoubtedly dark but I think the characters really inject a playfulness to it all, which would be the key IMO. 

Basically what I'm saying is what would be your thoughts if they ever decided to make a film adapted from the pre-existing storyline? How would you do it? I'm interested. 

Personally I would not want a direct adaption per-say, but have it be heavily based off of WaW and BlOps1s zombies. I think it would work best as a film first, video game adaption second. A title I came up with randomly would be something like ""Richtofen's Grand Scheme,"" something that'd grab people's attention as a film, not a popular video game adapted as a film.

Casting would be very tricky. I haven't figured that out in the slightest. ",,False,self,t5_2sal9,False,,,True,t3_1igm0w,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1igm0w/as_a_film/,

Right now, the following are fully confirmed (results reproduced AND the method known):

* The Spork [and the golden spork]
* The afterlife skulls and free Blunder Gat (which should be the only way to get multiple Blunder Gats post-patch, limiting it to two)
* Hell's Redeemer (the upgraded Hell's Retriever)
* Pop Goes The Weasel
* The bottle song (Secret song #1)
* The lockbox song (Secret song #2)
* Samantha's Lullaby

Now, according to PlayTheGame, there are TWO major easter eggs left, and to the best of even my research, those easter eggs are:

* ""Hell's Bells"" (Sal's ""Route"")
* An unknown Billy-related Easter Egg

Out of those two, only Hell's Bells appears to have been reproduced by others, and the requirements for it aren't yet clear (although it does involve 5 Brutus's being on the map at the same time - so two people are required).

It should be common knowledge at this point that PlayTheGame not only got insider information (which is probably the only reason they know about these Easter Eggs), but got early access to the map.

What I wish was public knowledge is that PlayTheGame is talking out of their collective asses on some of the stuff they're claiming as ""secret"". I fully think PlayTheGame is bullshitting at this point for exposure. If you watch one of their latest videos which contains allegedly not-yet-heard-ingame quotes from the characters, they play a few lines from two of the characters... that you probably already heard if you frequently played split-screen, as they're the bleed-out monologues of the characters. This was noticed by MANY people earlier, and even NextGenTactics (NGTZombies) beat them to posting them, and they did it without the PC version to extract files from.

Back to the actual alleged easter eggs, they are, by PlayTheGame's own admission (assuming they aren't bullshitting), INCOMPLETE, and Treyarch even patched out part of one of them. Now why is Hell's Bells nicknamed ""Sal's Route""? Because (again, according to PTG) there were supposed to be four different routes through Mob of the Dead: one for Weasel, one for Sal, one for Billy, and one for Finn, and out of those, only Weasel's remained fully intact. Hell's Bells was to be one step of Sal's route, and the other supposed easter egg (which was supposedly partially patched out) was to be a part of Billy's.

Misty is obsessed with Marlton, Marlton is a super nerd, and Russman is crazy. My thinking on how they all got 115 inside them is this. Russman is crazy and probably joined Stu in the eating of the zombie flesh. There are two ways Marlton could have gotten 115 in him. The first way is that he was a scientist working with 115 and he got it in him while working with it. The other way is that while in the Nuketown bunker he ran out of food and was forced to eat zombie meat. I'm assuming Misty sexually contracted it from Marlton.

***

Gonna give you guys a quick synopsis of the map. 

When you select the map on the globe, it's located in central Europe. It says ""Breslau, Germany"" (not sure of the exact spelling) when highlighted and is represented by a picture of a skyscraper. When you select it you are given a few options like in Green Run. You can either play Die Rise (the whole map) or play in one of the smaller areas: City, Village, Nuclear Plant and Jailhouse. I'll describe a game on Die Rise since it includes all of the areas.
 
In Die Rise, you start of on a hill in the middle of a field surrounded by fog. There is a tree on the hill with Quick Revive right in front of it, and there are two pickets around the base of the hill, one with the M14 and the other with the Olympia. Zombies will come out of the fog and attack you. You can step foot into the fog, but you will be attacked by Denizens. This hill is basically the central hub of the map, all of the areas are located around it. The bus in this map has been replaced with a wagon ride, once again piloted by T.E.D.D. except this time wearing a farmer's outfit. The wagon will come by the hill at round 5 (I think) and if you get onboard he will take you to one of the 4 areas that make up the map. The wagon travels along dirt trails that run through the field. (the field is very big by the way and I've already found some secrets in it, such as a crashed fighter jet)
 
So to keep things simple I will describe one area at a time.
 
**CITY** 

The title is self-explanatory, this area is a cityscape environment. There are a few points of interest here. First and foremost is the skyscraper. This building contains Speed Cola, a box spawn, and a few other things. The roof area is where the PaP can be found. You can navigate the different floors with the elevator. There are 5 or so different floors including the roof area. There is also an unfinished building in the city which was obviously under construction when the apocalypse occured. In there you can build the Headlamp using a hardhat and a flashlight. Wearing it lets you see your way through the fog easier and makes you immune to Denizens when you have it switched on. I think it also causes more zombies to come after you but I can't say for sure. There are also a few small buildings that don't need to be opened which have weapons in them. Last but not least there is a small park area, which is where you'll find another box location and Double Tap Root Beer. Something interesting here is a toppled statue of Adolf Hitler.
 
**VILLAGE** 

This area is a simple rural village, with a windmill, a well, a few houses and some farmland. Nothing too important here except a box location, Juggernog and Deadshot. This place seems to be the best for running trains.
 
**NUCLEAR PLANT** 

As you might guess, the main point of interest here is the power. The plant is one of those big white tubular structures. You can head down some stairs and open a door to get inside the underground facility. In here you'll find a box location, Mule Kick, and the power switch itself, which thankfully doesn't need to be built. There is also an under-construction atom bomb in the center of the facility.
 
**RAILROAD STATION** 
This is a small train station. It consists of a building, a train and the boarding platform. Here you'll find Stamin-Up and Tombstone, a box location, and the Galvaknuckles (in the train itself).
 
So yeah, that was just a brief description of the map. Obviously you can't get the full effect by just reading my breakdown of it, but from what I've played I really like it. I haven't played much so it's extremely likely that there's a lot more content than what I've seen already. The city is the only area I've really explored in. There are definitely a lot of secrets to be found in this very large map. If you have any questions about the map post a comment and I'll do my best to answer. And no I won't post a vid or pics, as that'll probably get me IP-banned. Not to mention I have nothing decent to record it with.
 
Hope you enjoyed reading, 
-J.L.

So if I get this straight there is a Playstation Magazine UK that gives Zombie tips and on their last page they say:

""There is a narrative in Tranzit, and an endgame of sorts. Death is the most common ending, but it's not necessarily the only ending. Pay attention to dialogue between the four new heroes and you'll begin to unravel the mystery behind the zombie takeover of Earth""

So what this is saying is that you somehow can ""survive""? My first thought was that they were just probably talking about the EE but it says that you are supposed to listen to the 4 Tranzit characters.

From what I have heard they don't talk about anything that could lead to something.

But what do you guys think about this?

Looking through the pictures of the loading screen for past zombies maps, I have found some interesting things.

1. The Nuketown loading screen page is actually the middle of the comic book. [You can actually see the staples in the middle of the page.](http://imgur.com/5USXacQ) Usually in comic books the staples are in the middle of the book.

2. There is a mysterious page in the book seen on the edge of the pages in: [Moon](http://imgur.com/t4FYWfx), [Sangri-la](http://imgur.com/GGfbGQJ), and [Nuketown](http://imgur.com/jyBppE1). I believe this page is DLC 4 which is believed to be a prequel.

3. The [Nacht Der Untote](http://imgur.com/Wjbrjkh) is either the first page or the second. In the loading the screen (Black Ops 1) on the left of the page, you can see another page. This is either the cover or another page.

I used [NGT's video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr_7rygEHoc), and made a transcription. I noticed some things that could be relevant to the zombies storyline. Here's the transciption:

Here's the transcript:

George Barkley:

&gt;attention all on this channel. This is George Barkley, former assistant director of the CDC facility in [Druid Hills, Georgia.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druid_Hills,_Georgia)


&gt;prior to the destruction of our headquarters, our research found evidence that contaminants are now infecting the very air we breathe. As such, exposure of some sort appears inevitable for all survivors. 

&gt;symptoms are variable, but most subjects display [short-term memory loss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_term_memory_loss), [psychosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis), [delusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion), and [paranoia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia). Short-term memory loss has also been reported, but as of yet, we've been unable to confirm this. 

&gt;Be advised to all individuals to monitor their fellow survivors for the above symptoms, paranoia in particular. Ask yourself, are those closest to you *really* who you think they are? Are they following their own secret agenda? Are they perhaps plotting against you? The dangers presented by such symptoms can not be overstated. It is with deep sadness that I myself was forced to euthanize 14 members of my own team. My condolences to their families. [unclear zombie voice]

&gt;I hope this message serves as a warning to all survivors; we must all do whatever it takes to ensure our survival as a species. Thank you.

Woman:

&gt;If there's anyone out there, *please* respond. I desperately need help. The others left me, and I'm alone, and I *need* help. [breath] I tried to do it, to do it right, but the others, they wouldn't listen. This piece goes here, **this piece goes there**, I couldn't do it on my own. [crying] I need help, I really do, the German man stopped talking to me and I don't know what to do... [crying] what do do. 

The Flesh guy:

&gt;Science has failed us. *He*, has abandoned us. In this new world, we alone are your salvation. We alone can light the way. 

&gt;[partial zombie voice, in background: ""help me, please""]

&gt;Heed our words, heed our call. There is but one path to enlightenment. Just as they would consume us, we would consume them. We are the living, *and* we are the dead. We are The Flesh, and The Flesh, is us. We will not starve. We will thrive.

Saber One-Zero (military Op?):

&gt;Red-Con Five, this is Saber One-Zero. Our sweep failed to find any evidence of survivors on site. Broken Air was not viable for new F-O-V. 

&gt;That's a negative, Sir. Records appear to have been destroyed in a fire prior to the facility being overrun. 

&gt;Sir, we believe Stab may have been trying to destroy evidence implicating them in the outbreak. 

&gt;Understood, Sir. Confirm drop in T Minus 5. Retreating to safe distance.

Survivor:

&gt;To anyone listening: We have food, water, and medical supplies. Enough to last several years. [indecipherable zombies voice]

First off, in Barkley's audio, he says that the virus spread by air as well. This means that all four of our characters have the zombie virus, not just Stuhlinger. Well, we already notice that Stu is paranoid, and is a conspiracy theorist, which shows that he is definitely contaminated. Also, Barkley says that he killed 14 of his team because they were infected, and they were plotting to kill him. Not very relevant, but it's probable that he was contaminated and not his crew.

Next, the woman. She says the others left her. This could mean that she was with another group of survivors. She talks about pieces, as if she's building something. This could either be a reference to the buildables that were introduced in BO2, or possibly an easter egg. She also says that the German man stopped talking to her. This could be Richtofen, or Maxis. I'm not sure if Maxis is German, but I'm pretty sure he is. This means that one of them is talking to her, possibly trying to get her and her group to do a similar task/the same task our group is doing, but her group left her, and now she's alone. She could very well be a character in future maps. Also, since it sounds like she was the only one in her group capable of hearing ""the German man"", that means that she's probably also consumed zombie flesh, like Stu. 

After that is a person from The Flesh, which seems like a cult that has decided to eat zombie flesh to survive. It sounds like their theory is that if they eat the zombie flesh, they'll neither be alive or dead, and thus the zombies won't attack them. It sounds like there's a possibility that Stu and the woman from the last audio clip were in The Flesh at one point, but left. We also hear a zombie voice asking for help, probably meaning that eating zombie flesh doesn't turn out too well, and that guy is turning into a zombie. Maybe a reason why Stu and new girl left The Flesh. 

Okay, then there's the military guy, talking to his commanding officer. we don't know much about it, but it looks like they're looking for survivors, but we have no idea what Broken Air is, who ""Stab"" is, what his connection to the zombie outbreak is, and what is being dropped. We can tell that Stab probably had something to do with the zombies, or else he wouldn't be destroying evidence about himself. Also, who is ""them""? It sounds like Stab might actually be a group of people, rather than one person.

Then the survivor. Not much there, but it could be a person from the mystery girl's group, or a random person, just showing off that there are other survivors, that aren't necessarily in as bad a situation as our group is. 

A lot of this stuff could be pointing to future maps/EE, or it could just be fluff, filling in the spaces of the storyline, showing backstory, etc. What do you think?",,False,self,t5_2sal9,False,,paralyzer,True,t3_1g380o,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1g380o/die_rise_tv_clues_on_storyline/,

But this is my last attempt at anything related to tranzit EE continuation. So, On the license plate of the bus it read ""XP-79"". Well there was a prototype plane called the XP-79. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_XP-79
Now, There are a couple of things i find interesting about this plane and its relation to tranzit. First and most obvious is that the plane is powered by a single jet engine, with that said the first thing that comes to mind is somehow using the build-able jet gun somehow to continue the EE. Second interesting fact about the XP-79 is that the pilot operated the plane from a prone position. So maybe while using the jet gun in a certain spot on the map while prone you could get a new Richthofen or maxis quote. Lastly, the plane only had one flight, in which it crashed. So maybe you would have to either break the jet gun or get downed to get a new quote. And my other theory relating to this is that you might have to do any of the tasks mentioned above, while on the bus to possibly unlock the 2nd bus route. Any other leads would be appreciated.

Zombies run too fast.

What's the point of giving the human power ups if he'll die within seconds and some are even useless. Max ammo? You'll be lucky to even use one clip.

**EDIT:** In my personal opinion, the mode has quite some flaws when played by the majority of the community who is good/1+ k/d at the game and find the mode easy. If the same mode was played by someone who doesn't take the game so seriously it might actually be a good mode.

Basically, Turned should have different difficulties and each mode has its own levels and etc. Work on the DLC a bit more to make it just as good for the Zombie players as it is for the Multiplayer base.

 Then, I open the bank, and withdraw untill I have 20,000 points. After that I buy jug, staminup, and semtex. 

Next I will run into the woods and purchase the bowie knife (I don't like getting the galvaknuckles since melee is a bit dodgy after round 11 and points aren't a problem.) 

Then I go crack the power on and make my way to the farm. I get Double Tap II and claymores.

 Finally, I arrive at the diner. Buy speed, and build the zombie shield, and train there.

 I get the MP5 and use that + the bowie until round 16 or 17. Then I hit the box until I have 25,000 points, keeping the two best weapons it gives me.

Well dont feel alone, i like the thrill of having to try and hold out somewhere as long as possible.  So ive made a list of a couple of places i found fairly fit!!

- The bus depot!!

Go outside with a turbine and place the turbine on the furthest LEFT side of the outside door.

If done correctly you shouldve only opened 1 of the double doors.

Now you have a hold out room with 0 windows and only 1 point of entry!!!

If things get to hairy you can always lay down another turbine to the other door and get out of dodge!!

- The farm

The same thing applies to the farm

Go up to the barn

place the turbine on the LEFT side of the barn door

You should only have the front barn door open(and the back window)

the side barn door should be closed

Now you only have 2 points of entry

the window at the back and the front door of the barn

also again if things get to hairy place a turbine by the side barn door and get out!!

- Power station(this one is the hardest having no perks)

go down into the white power room and make sure the power is OFF.  Know that having the power OFF means that even if you have perks they will not be useable.

Go into the room with the power switch

you now have 2 points of entry

the front door and the side window

the metal rolling door should be closed as you have the power off

again if things get too hairy, drop a turbine by the steel rolling door and out you go!!!

- The town(2 possible)

probably the easiest of them all is above the bar

you have 2(3) points of entry

the window to the left, the stairs you just came up, and be aware they drop in from the roof where the box spawns.

if things get bad just run out the back of the building ;)

(Second location, probably the safest in regards to entry points but hardest in later rounds)

Go to where you open the single door to look for the bus part, across from where the box spawns behind the chain fence.

place a turbine down and enter the room

you now have 1 point of entry, a single door

bunker down and make sure you have ammo and ray guns and monkeys :P

like i said this is a super safe place, aside from the fact that you have no way out lol unless you have monkey and or EMPS.  So at high rounds this would be extremely difficult just due to the amount of zombies and their health.

Theres a few more spots that could be considered ""Hold out"" locations but i thought these were some of the lesser known. :P

If you go to the pack a punch room, you can find crates that have the [USSR State Quality Mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Quality_Mark_of_the_USSR). This was established in 1967, and discontinued in 1991.

[The logo on the crates in game.](http://i.imgur.com/tVw6z.png)

[The actual logo.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Znak_kachestva_2.svg)

You can see they are the same, sorry for the in game image being blurry.

Anyway since we know that Green Run is after Nuketown, which was between July 1966 and June 1967, we can conclude that Green Run took place at least in 1967, right? Not so fast, there is this radio recording by Dr. Maxis:

""You! You are not one of those foul creatures. Excellent, I have been searching for decades. Listen now, what I have to say is of the utmost importance to mankind. If you would see this planet free from the curse of these wretched undead creatures, and the monstrous evil which controls them, then you must obey my every command. I cannot affect physical change... yet. You must be my hands. Only you can stop that awful worm, Richtofen.""

**""searching for decades""**
That puts us at least at 1986 (Chernobyl?).

Yeah, they had a great success with Mob of the Dead, but supposedly the only reason they did DLC 2 was so the Zombie Team could work on DLC 3 and 4 simultaneously. The Zombies team also always goes out with a big, crazy bang (Der Riese, Moon) and despite how fun Buried is, it just isn't that big of a bang.

But the big thing is they are the ZOMBIES TEAM! Why would they take the back seat and give the campaign team the finale? It just doesn't seem like something they would do.

I have two theories as to the campaign teams involvement, since I do believe they are involved in DLC 4's production.

A) We are getting one, big, super awesome map and the Zombies Team and Campaign team have been brought together to put everything they possibly can into this map.

B) We are getting another big Zombies specific pack, but not 100% Rezurrection style. Maybe 2 brand new map, 1 or 2 throwbacks, and then some other new stuff (Weapons, Perks, Gamemodes) that get added in across all maps like the Ray Gun MK II. Because of the scope and scale of this theoretical map, Treyarch is having the Zombies Team work on one map and some bonuses while the Campaign team makes their own map and bonuses.

Theory done.

You know how you can press that big red button when you have a lobby full of people who have done the easter egg? It gives ultimate power to whichever side you picked and erases your easter egg progress in every story map, right? I thought about why Treyarch would do this, I mean we wouldn't do this all for nothing, right? It dawned on me: our easter egg choices aren't going to effect the map in the way many of us thought before.

What if pushing that button is our vote for which side's easter egg we want canon? Treyarch would look at which choice we made, and then impliment the easter egg in different ways depending on which side we chose. For example: if Treyarch saw that we voted for Maxis, the next map's dlc would focus on stopping Maxis. And if they saw we voted for Richtophen, then the next's map dlc would focus on stopping Richtophen.

This also lines up with what Vonderhaar said [here](http://imgur.com/q3dmZyW). We will ultimately decide the New Crew's fate forever with our vote. It's an ""unorthodox"" idea because this is the first (and probably last) time we choose what happens to our heroes.

Now, what's interesting about Mob of the Dead's (MotD) map is that there are a lot of ways to end the game, unlike the traditional one. What I noticed that because of this, it opens up the possibility of you hearing another easter egg song. Now, take note of this. [This is the game over song](http://youtu.be/-ZnsBiehXBI?t=4s) when you die traditionally in MotD. Now take note of the song that plays after you complete the easter egg (Pop Goes the Weasel achievement) [here (courtesy of NGTZombies)](http://youtu.be/0jRGXZacRuk?t=1m50s). We will notice that there's a difference: that choir piece at the end of the latter version.

Now the last time we heard that familiar choir piece in recent memory is from Moon, [when you see Sam](http://youtu.be/azZ9bZa3GgM?t=9m59s) (Controller of the Zombies since CoD:WaW) for the first time. So here's my question: since Weasel also hints Nikolai's name a lot, will the original characters let themselves manifest in the next map? Is that choir piece a nod to Sam?/Is that her theme song?

Yes, a lot of us believe that they're probably dead, since there's been no clue of their existence since the last three maps. But since MotD introduces the Afterlife mechanic, it's not impossible to get them back (for example: the next map might support 8-players [since our zombie engine now supports the multiplayer engine] to solve the easter egg so one team will play as the original characters in the afterlife, solving puzzles together with players who are ""alive"" (our Tranzit characters) like how the current map (MotD) introduces the mechanic).

All you have to do is build the plane. It doesn't involve the blundergat or hell's retriever or anything. I'm not sure on where every place is called but I'll do my best to describe it. This can be done with any number of players. I did it solo.

Steps:

1. Get the warden's key. The key is hanging from an electrified pole in the prisons(where all the cells are). Just look around and you'll find it. There are a couple different spots but I'm pretty sure they're all by the cells. To get the key you have to enter the afterlife and find a spot you can jump in close to the key. You will overload the box that is electrifying the key and then you can grab it.

2. Get the plane parts. Once you have the wardens key you can access all the spots where the parts are. The shirt is in the laundry room, the oxygen tank is on the docks, one of them are by entrance to the roof(above the cafeteria, I forget what that part is called). Those three are very easy, you just use the wardens key. 
The next two require a little more work though. The one one the elevator requires you to go to the afterlife and travel to the bottom of the elevator. On the way down you'll see three numbers(they're very easy to see so I won't explain where). Enter these number into the combination at the the bottom. Go revive your self and then run to the very bottom of the elevator(Down the stairs from where the combination thing is). The part is sitting there now. 
The last piece is the engine. This is in the warden's office. You have to de-electrify the fence before you can unlock it though. To do this go buy the gate/door that costs 1500(not the 2000 door that goes to the docks). Go into the afterlife and overload the three machines. Two of them are in the room you are in. The last machine is in a room only accessible in the afterlife. Look around and you'll see it. After this go unlock the door and grab the engine.

3. Getting on the roof. Go to the area above the cafeteria. Get into the afterlife and find the hole in the wall(this hole is in the hallway before the room with the dog spot). You can open the door from that side. Go revive yourself and get on the roof!

4. If you have all the parts go to the spot to build and and hold x. Afterwards get on the plane and get the achievement!

I'm sorry for how vague this is. I'm in a rush to type this and I have only played a couple games so far. If you need me to elaborate more on any of the parts just leave a comment and I'll try to respond as quickly as I can. Thanks!

I've played every map and I understand it's usually love it or hate it when it comes to preferred maps for most of us. 

I always felt I like the same ones as everyone else and disliked the same ones too all for similar reasons. However it seems a lot of you here have some very derogatory things to say about my all time favorite map; Tranzit.

here's why i like it: buildable items give you an additional edge to your 'class', there are so many ways to navigate the map, the bank account helps you bounce back after an inopportune death, pack a punch is actually a challenge and has to be earned especially in solo or a game with no mics, no dogs/minions, so many great areas for running trains but most of them can be hazardous because of the bus, if you get bored you can always hang out in the nacht throwback area and relive the glory days!

what does everyone have against this amazing map?

EDIT:
if i called you a noob it's because you can't evolve your style to suit your environment. you are not a ninja. quit bitching that the maps are different or more complicated than before, you should retire your ps3 and go play pong or monopoly or some shit. it's like me saying i don't like die rise because i die a lot. i don't care about that, i don't like the map because it's too cramped and moving from one area to any other area is very restricted. i've never liked maps like that. also hate the closed quarters aspect most of the map provides. i LOVE die rise because it challenges me to become a better zombie slayer.

But you would actually drive it. and it could be upgrade-able like the bus. maybe you could add a manned turret that you could have another player operate. and i was thinking of more of a zombies-esque  warthog from halo. It sounds very overpowered at first, but there would be limited fuel and there would be a drop that would look like a fuel canister and it would give you a full refill on gas. There would also be a new perk called ""fuel efficient"", there's really no need to explain what it does. And you could use the vehicle to get to places you couldn't normally get on foot. for example there might be a jump that you would need to hit boost right before hitting it and you would get to a new part of the map. And it breaking and having to rebuild it would obviously be an issue because it would most likely be a fairly large map. So there would be a equipment that you could buy that would repair the vehicle( all players could have the tool at once). This tool would work very similar to how you repair vehicles in battlefield. and the more people you have repairing at once the faster it would repair. and most importantly, you couldn't repair while you were in the vehicle. But if you didn't repair the vehicle and kept damaging it you would have to build it again. Lastly there would also be another new perk called ""mechanic"".

When I got to the point close to the beginning of zombies, I found a strange fact: Richtofen had made the other original three players super soldiers. This is interesting in and of itself and it explains the enhanced powers that they have (fast healing, stamina, strength, ability to use various classes of weapons, etc.). However, there was a fourth man, a Mexican, who died from the testing. I realized that these people were working with stuff to reanimate people, hence the zombie apocalypse. This is where the abomination/giant tie in. I thought of the movie ""the Incredible Hulk"" and I remembered the Blonsky guy who took a super soldier serum and then took doses of the hulk's blood. This combo turned him into an incredibly huge and powerful monstrosity, dubbed the abomination. If richotofen gave the Mexican 115 to bring him back to life, perhaps he was transformed into a beast. Richotofen could then lock him up until he had control of the zombies aka now. Now richotofen can let the giant loose.

(Spoilers),29,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/17nfsr/die_rise_first_several_steps_towards_the_high/,"Alright, for those of you wondering in general about the process so far, or who have not watched any videos, this is just a general outline of the first couple steps. 

Start the game, buy the SVU off the wall once through the first set of doors. Then turn on the power.

There are 4 elevators that have gold medallions on the top of them. All 4 players are required for this. Without being crushed or killed by zombies, all 4 players must be on the medallions at the same exact time, you either have to jump, or just stand on them. If done correctly, they will begin to glow.

Now you must find the other 4 similar medallions on the floor just outside of the elevators. Stand away from the medallion, and one by one have people walk up to it. They will begin to glow when stepped on in the right order. This will take several tries of trial and error. Once done, all of the medallions will glow and continue to glow. 

Now is the part where the SVU comes in. Take it to an area where you can see both of the dragons that are on the opposite roof from the main spawn. Aim at the mouths and you will see black orbs inside of them. Shoot them one at a time, and if done correctly there will be sparks shooting out of the dragons tails. 

The orbs will then transport to the lion statues that can be found on both sides of the double doors at the main spawn point.

This is where the split in the story line will occur. If you are a fan of Maxis, two people can grab the orbs, and go down to the room with the upside down Buddha statues. There, Maxis will command you to give a blood sacrifice, which basically means to kill zombies in that room. I would suggest using all 4 people so that it can be accomplished quicker. When you do this correctly, Maxis will say that you have given enough blood.

If you prefer to follow Richtofen, you must build the Sliquifier, have 2 people grab it, and return back to the statues that have the orbs. You then shoot the orbs with the sliquifiers until they are spinning. This will be a trial and error ordeal. 

This is as far as I have gotten, and as far as NGTZombies or anybody else have gotten. There are multiple medallions around the map that I haven't found any use for yet. There are at least 3 medallions featuring a zombie, and at least 2 featuring the lions from the lion statues that held the orbs after shooting them out of the dragon mouths. Also there is a ton of speculation that the next step has something to do with either Mahjong Tiles, or with the Who's Who perk.

Personally, although the Raygun is an iconic zombie weapon, I think its overrated in black ops 2, and here's why:

* No PhD Flopper means that the raygun can no longer be used as a weapon to get out of tricky situations, as your more than likely going to down yourself.
* The raygun is only really effective up until the point when it become multiple shots to kill one zombie, which is fairly early on, compared to something like the voice of justice, for example. however, the early rounds are the ones you kind of want to 'point whore', and it seems that the raygun doesn't give nearly as many points as a gun that shoots bullets, due to no points from hitmarkers.
* At higher rounds it creates crawlers. these can be useful at the end of the rounds, but not if your running a tight rape train, as they can easily get you trapped. Besides, if you need a crawler its easy to get one with claymores.

Although it seems like I'm hating on the raygun, its still a cool and fun weapon to use, I just don't think its as effective as it used to be, especially with new weapons. I would rather choose the voice of justice of the raygun any day, due to the fact that the VoJ is a 1-hit-kill until round 30 (I think?), it doesn't have splash damage yet its still a small weapon which is good for running around, especially if you don't have stamin up.

If the map I linked is correct (up is north), this would make the map take place slightly after sunrise. If the map from the game is correct, it might be slightly before sunset.

**1.**Feed him near a Mystery Box location and he will go retrieve the mystery box and set it down in the location you fed him by. Lots of speculation on this one so if you have trouble try having his back turned to the box or feed him while your touching the box location.


**2.**Hit the mystery box and if you wanna reroll without spending any points just feed him while the gun is still outside the box and he will kick it for another roll


**3.**Feed him near a crafting bench and he will go retrieve the parts and build it quickly. If you don't have the Turbine built and you feed him near the bench in the court house or by the jail cell bench he will build that first before the trample steam.


**4.**Feed him near the subsurface resonater and he will go grab the turbine and set it down near the resonator.

It's pretty much common knowledge that MoTD takes place on New Years Eve 1933. This is from the audio logs that are obtained during the Pop Goes the Weasel easter egg. It is commonly accepted that Sal, Billy, Finn, and Weasel are mobsters in prison for doing mobster shit (honestly can't remember off the top of my head if there is actually anything in game to verify WHY they are in prison, it's early).

And that is where the problem starts. In 1933 Alcatraz wasn't in operation as a federal penitentiary until 1934. Prior to its use as a federal prison it had been used a military fort and prison. As a federal prison Alcatraz opened ""officially"" on July first 1934.

So what gives? Is it a simple mistake on the game designers part? Or is there some strange, as yet unrealized, significance to the fact that the events take place at a time when they couldn't have taken place? It could be a simple mistake/oversight, but with as much effort as they put into getting so many other details right....

Also an interesting side note: I learned something while double checking my facts this morning that I found interesting. There was never an electric chair or gas chamber or any other form of capitol punishment located on Alcatraz Island.

1363126708.0,20,self.CODZombies,1a6c9y,Ski Resort map idea,31,11,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1a6c9y/ski_resort_map_idea/,"I was inspired by another redditor, and came up with this cool (IMO) map idea. It would be a cross of classic Kino style maps and Tranzit. SO here goes:

The setting is at a mountain, possibly in the Alps, and the mountain has skiing trails. There would be 4 lodges, one at the East base of the mountain, one at the West, one at the North and finally one at the South  base of the mountain. There would also be mini lodges on the East, West, North and South sides of the mountain halfway up. Finally there is a small lodge at the top. Here comes the interesting part: there are ski lifts from each base lodge to the lodge halfway up the mountain (i.e. from East base lodge to East halfway up lodge), and then from there they all go to the summit. To activate each ski lift, there is a control panel that must be built, similarly to the power in Tranzit. After they have been activated, you can ride them. You might be wondering how you get down from the summit. Well at the top, besides Jugg, power, and maybe the PDW (or a new wall weapon), there would be a buildable sled. It would be the only buildable that you can carry around, like the Trample Steam is the only one on Die Rise. When you take it out, you can melee with it like the Zombie Shield. But, you can place it at the top of one of the ski trails. These ski trails are from the top to the 4 halfway up lodges, and from each one of those down to their corresponding lodge. When you place the sled, you press X (or the corresponding button on PS3/PC) to get on and you sled down, like a cross of the ice slide and ziplines in COTD. You can turn around and shoot, but there is a predestined, curvy path. Once you get to the bottom of the trail, you get kicked off but automatically pick the sled back up. You might be thinking that it would be annoying to have to go all the way up to the summit and all the way back down to get from the East base lodge to the South one or whatever lodge. But, alas, there would be trails you can run/walk along around the middle of the mountain. There might be weapon on the rock face along one or two of these. BUT, if you spend too long on these trails,you can freeze the same way as in COTD (Think ~3 minutes to freeze completely). This would not apply at the bottom of the mountain. There would just be a road. JUST THOUGHT OF THIS there could also be tunnels from the halfway up North lodge to the South one and East to West. There could even be PAP in one of these tunnels, but you have to activate it somehow, IDK how though. Also, there could be two of my Perk ideas, Medi-Milk (Costs 2500, white colored, makes you heal 50% faster) and Perko Bismol (Costs 4000, pink colored, lets you buy as many perks as you want, not just 4). The Perks, wall weapons, box spawns, and buildables would be in all the different lodges. That just about wraps it up, I'll add some things I thought of as I was writing this below.

There could be buildable coat thing, build it once, it doesn't take up a slot, it just makes you freeze about a minute slower than normal.

It would be cool to have a SCAR-H, make it feel like Battlefield Bad Company 2 and Black Ops 2 Zombies Combined.

There would also be a flamethrower in the box, like from WaW, and shooting it at your friend on the trail would make their freeze timer reset.

On it there was the hint for ascension in both the top display of Woods and the bottom left that showed the Campaign scene of Woods and the person you play as (can't remember the name) infiltrating the launch facility.

The Middle display showed the scene in the campaign were you descend from a mountain in a snowy area (which name I can't remember either) that hinted towards Call of the Dead DLC.

The Bottom right display showed a helicopter scene in the jungles of Vietnam that hinted towards the Shangri-La DLC.

And the last was the tattoo of the Moon with a werewolf howling in front of it on Wood's arm in the top display that hinted towards the last DLC being the Moon.

Outside of the case giving hints, there were plenty of theorists that got the map to be released, spot on simply through in depth analysis of the radio messages and bits and pieces of Easter Eggs strewn about in each map.

So my question is: does anyone have a theory based on the back of the case for Black Ops 2 or even through the Easter Eggs on Tranzit that predicts the next maps to be released?

I believe everyone is under the assumptions that the dlc is going to add to the tranzit map making it larger, not sure how much larger. But if this is the case I hope they add in multiple places to pap. As of now you can pap in the town, but lets say the first dlc adds 3(doubt this is the case) more locations to the tranzit map(given a total of 7 stops) then maybe one of the new locations will have the options to pap. 

I know people have been complaining about not being able to see how many points they have in the bank, so I would love be able to see the total with out having to take all my points out. 
I would also like to be able to get my points out easier, it would be cool if they add an ATM to the maps. That way you don't have to go all the way to the bank to draw points out. This will be especially usefully if they make tranzit very large.

For Reference, heres the video I will be basing this assumption off of: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2211LnfoM (Uprising Trailer from IGN)

So there has been much debate here and on the official CoD Forums as to whether hell hounds are in the new map, Mob of The Dead (MoTD). Well... the truth is, they're not HellHounds specifically.
Why They Are Not HellHounds: HellHounds were created when Samantha's pregnant Dog, Fluffy, got teleported and was lost in the Ether and started producing the HellHounds. People always seem to forget that this is taking place during the Prohibition Era. We can specifically pinpoint the date to somewhere between January 5, 1933 - April 19, 1937. Why? because in the background there's the unfinished Golden Gates Bridge, and seeing as its close to being finished, I'd say 1935-1937. So clearly not during the WWII era where the HellHounds were created.

What Could They Be?: I Personally believe that Dog in the Video (2:59-3:00) is the Wardens Guard Dog.
""That's stupid DeathGod616, how is the Warden's Guard dog?!"", I'm Glad you asked. If you watch the video (2:59-3:00), even though its for literally a second, you can see the Dog Barking at you, yet its not moving. Upon further inspection, I think i can see Chains around the dogs ""Neck"" (I say ""Neck"" since the Dog just seems to be a head). This would make complete sense given the Prison Environment... and why its not moving towards the player even though it clearly acknowledges the Players presence.

Boss Zombie: Why i think there's is most definitely going to be a boss zombie is because for some reason I just have it in my mind that this is going to be very similar to Call of The Dead (CoTD), while not exactly the same, but similar. I already told you why i think the GuardDog is not the boss zombie. I think it's the Warden. I have looked around a bunch and haven't really seen people mention this, or even speculate on this.

THE WARDEN: http://i.imgur.com/7cnf5SB.jpg

Obviously this zombie sticks out the most. Very well dressed, Clean hair, Gloves... this Zombie is living the good life. Now there can really only be one person this Zombie could be... The Warden. I can't think of anyone else, can you? Now, from his appearance alone, he doesn't seem to be able to tank a lot of hits like George A Romero... Nor does he seem as slow as George Either... so maybe this Warden is a speedy little fucker that just runs around locking you up? I don't know. Maybe this Zombie is the reason this map is the ""most terrifying"" map yet.

Well those are my thoughts. What are yours?

Tl;dr, Evil dog thing in the trailer is actually the Wardens Guard Dog and the boss zombie is the Warden himself.

This post will be put in the sidebar, so please kindly point anyone asking in that direction.

For starters, there is NO official information on how the rankings work. The only information that we can be pretty certain about is that tally marks are an indicator of how often you play, and are not considered a rank. Blue eyes are attained by getting five tally marks.

There are five ranks, single bone, crossbones, skull, skull with knife, and skull with shotguns.

Everything from this point on is speculation. 

Kill to down ratio seems to be the biggest factor in ranking up. A k/d ratio of 30 is needed for a skull ranking, 100 for skull with knife and 180 for a skull with shotguns. Other factors that go into the ranking are highest rounds, accuracy, headshots, and a combination of all the other stats, although the first three seem to have the biggest influence.

If there is anything I missed or got wrong feel free to correct me and I will edit the post.

- The ""Green Run"" was a secret U.S. Government release of radioactive fission products on December 2–3, 1949, at the **Hanford Site** plutonium production facility.

- 'Green Run' (zombies map), is set at Hanford; The layout of the map is ""near identical to that of Hanford"", according to Wikipedia. I'm a little skeptical of this claim honestly after seeing pictures of the site, save for [this image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Pic_hanford_streetscene.jpg) of the town pre-government facility, which looks a little like the town in Zombies.

- Worth noting that Hanford, Washington was a small agricultural community, decommissioned by the government in the 40s and 50s. The architectural style of 'Green Run' in zombies is definitely 40s and 50s-ish. 

- The town (Hanford, Washinton) was condemned by the Federal government to make way for the Hanford site. Most buildings were destroyed, with the notable exception of the high school. The school still stands today, marred by its use during the years for SWAT practice, and ***can be seen from the Hanford tour bus operated by the U.S. government.***

I enjoyed being able to have half your team die, yet you could keep the game alive by spreading the zombie hords around the map and actually have some strategy.

In case you didn't know, Samuel has a book in his vest in Buried and possibly other maps. I know the Zombies community has been involved in numerous tinfoil theories, but this one may have some merit. What if it is Maxis' diary? Stu doesn't seem like the type read books or to write down his thoughts and feelings, and even if he did, we would've at least had a loading screen entry of his work at some point. Speaking of loading screens, ever wonder about the Maxis diary entries. Sure, it can *just* be a little insight to this whole situation in a canonical (and cheaper compared to new radios and voicelines) form. What if there was something more to it? How can we be getting all this information if the book hadn't been found. Maxis is hesitant to talk about his plan for total control, so obviously he's not letting a group of imbeciles read his thoughts and personal opinions on topics.

""But Gaaame! Where's your proof? You're not ""Perform Actions in an Activity in the Middle""! You're right, I'm not them, so I won't be talking about France today. Recently, I've stumbled upon a post by the [lovely CoDz forums] (http://www.callofdutyzombies.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=100&amp;t=34328) that contained quotes that pertained to a story in either a minor, or major way. Samuel has some quotes in Die Rise which I find is very very interesting. Particularly *""Oh - it's this book! It's cursed!""*. Even though  he doesn't provide audio proof of the quote, I'll happily trust a regular poster in the forums. 

How did Sam even find the Diary? Why did he keep it? Was it the voices? Answers to that and more on the next episode of *""As the Post Apocalyptic World Turns""*!

here I believe is [takeo](http://i.imgur.com/e4aURj4.jpg) in the black is his katana, red is his satchel and i have no idea what that is in the green on his side.

now is [this](http://i.imgur.com/jxXLwap.jpg) a new golden rod?

first impressions, didn't stare at every frame of the video for an hour. so downvote all you want.

[here](https://vine.co/v/hbF5W35QvBx) is the vine teaser, it doesn't work on Internet explorer so use chrome.

EDIT: I've kinda looked at it more and most of the pics look like they are on a belt on takeo. i'm guessing takeo is being a big thing from what I see.

It already does tons of damage as the regular version, but when you pack a punch that son of a bitch it is ridiculous! At round 20 I was still getting one shot kills! I didn't even know till about 15 rounds later that it could be fully automatic!

Not just that but the grenade launcher on it makes it super versatile!

I will probably use this every game, and highly recommend it for you guys to use.",,False,self,t5_2sal9,False,,,True,t3_1jrcqg,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1jrcqg/holy_crap_the_m16a1_is_incredible/,

Basically, half the time (or more than half the time) I can't even get in lobbies, and I literally CANNOT play grief, because there are never enough players! i had always thought PC dominated the zombies world coming from WAW customs back a couple years ago, but unfortunately it seems like somehow there are MORE people playing WAW zombies, than BO2 zombies! What's up with that?

Can anyone relate? Most of the time I just end up playing solo, but there's something about playing with a team that makes zombies more fun :/",,False,self,t5_2sal9,False,,electriccherry,True,t3_1jr0hd,http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1jr0hd/anyone_else_hate_this_pc/,
