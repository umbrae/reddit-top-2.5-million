****

**EVERYONE GET ON BOARD THE MURDER EXPRESS!! IT'S TIME TO BRING YOUR PAIN GAME, AND WE'RE GONNA BREAK DOWN WHAT OUR NEW KROGAN CLANMATE HAS TO OFFER! SO SIT BACK, KNUCKLE UP, AND GET READY TO BUST SOME SKULLS!!**
****
&gt;What you will be bringing to the fight
****


First things first, your arsenal.

1. **Biotic Charge**: The **TRAIN** of **MURDERTRAIN**'ing. For the build that I will show you, this will be one of your main methods of moving about the map. It's your *fastest* way of moving around the map. And you can also spec it to recharge your shields. Making this talent *INVALUABLE*.

1. **Carnage**: A projectile that has some pretty gnarly reload times. And by gnarly I mean terribad. It has it's uses, and I'm not about to say it's useless, but for the sake of our eventual build, it is. Our goal will be to cut down on Cooldown. Taking this will defeat that purpose, as our next talent...


3. **Barrier**: **THE MOTHER OF ALL TECH ARMORS.** Not only will you get a boost to your **MASSIVE** shields, but you can also buff your Powers. See where I'm going with this? We're beefing up the Train.
4. **Krogan Battlemaster**: Oh, what's this? Why is he listing this? **BECAUSE MURDER TRUCKER!!** The new Krogan Battlemaster Skill has a new Bonus to Power Damage! 35% total over that measly 27.5% the little Soldiers and Sentinels get! Aww! Look at the wittle Krogan babies! 

No. Really. Next time you're in a game with Krogans, look how small they are compared to you.

**BECAUSE THEY AREN'T THE MURDERTRAIN INCARNATE!!**

Take the Power bonus over the Weapon bonus. Except maybe slot 6. But we'll cover that later.

For those wondering, **RAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE** is built the same as the other Krogan classes.  Shield and melee buffs.

****
&gt;How to put the **PAIN** in **MURDERTRAIN** (can't you spell?)
****


**:HEADBUTT:** I can spell just *fine*.

So where do we go with this?  We know we won't use Carnage. And Rage is the same as Soldiers/Sentinels in clan Krogan. So how do you **MURDERTRAIN**?

Let's go down the list:

**Biotic Charge**:Damage(Radius)/Melee Synergy/Barrier

*MELEE SYNERGY IS UNIQUE TO KROGAN VANGUARD*


I chose Damage over Radius for the sole reason that I want to deal as much damage as possible when I charge into someone. You can take whatever you'd like here.  It's really up to you.  You hit the force of train, and that's not being punny at all.  Adding Damage to the mix makes you even more fearsome.  Radius makes you stun some more baddies, but you lack an effective crowd control follow up, which is why I prefer the single damage dealer.  You could argue that taking radius is supposed to help, but to each their own. Damage, or Stun.  Melee synergy is there for this wonderful trick: RIGHT after you charge, hold down melee.  You will do your Heavy Melee. Then follow up with a melee.  Very little can withstand this combo.  If *that* doesn't work, shotgun. Rinse, repeat. Barrier is for shield recharge.

~~Carnage:~~ We're skipping this.  Too much cooldown for us.

**Barrier**:Blast Effect/Power Synergy/Power Recharge

Now here's my reasoning behind this.

The idea is to not **TANK**.  While our goal is to melee, our goal is to melee *smart*. How, might you ask?

First, we have taken Blast Effect. And over a 5% durability. Why? Because 5% isn't going to do much. Not much at all. Not for Gold anyway (am I saying to take this into Gold? NO. But from what little I've used this in Gold, and have played Gold, you play smart anyway).  Blast Effect will do a couple things for us. First of all, it gives us an AoE attack that can shove enemies out of our way with a pretty quick cooldown.  Plus, it will give the humorous effect of lifting enemies into the air around us.  You can combo into these 'floaters' with Biotic Charge, if you'd like.  I like using this when I'm surrounded by Husks, Soldiers, Swarmers, and other Squishies.

Power Synergy turns Biotic Charge from a **MURDERTRAIN** into a **MURDER-FREIGHT-TRAIN**.  You'll reliably 1HKO Cannibals and all other Squishies with a Biotic Charge (tested with Damage upgrade) on Bronze, and take off a large chunk of health in Silver.

The cooldown reduction should make sense.  We want to reduce our cooldown, while still taking some durability increase, and upping our power output.

**Krogan Battlemaster**: Damage &amp; Capacity/Power Damage/Shotgun Weight

The goal here is to up our power damage for the **MURDERTRAIN A COMIN'** and lower our cooldown.  This accomplishes that.  You *can* take weapon damage for the last spot, but that's up to you. Your Mileage May Vary.  Would you rather have a heavier shotgun, or just something light that a squishy little Drell likes to use?

**RAAAAAAAAAAGE**: Durability/Martial Artist/Fitness Expert

Self explanatory, and coupled with our Biotic Charge-&gt;HeavyMelee-&gt;Melee combo, you should be able to hit rage no problem.  You want the extra shields over the 2 rage option since we aren't take the durability in Barrier.  So we make up for it here.
****
&gt;What weapon should I take?
****


**WELL THAT'S A SILLY QUESTION!**

Honestly, take what you like.  But take ***ONE***.  You want to keep your cooldown **LOW**.  The Disciple is a good, lightweight shotgun if you have nothing else leveled up.  The Claymore is *STRONG, AND MAKES KROGAN PROUD*, but VERY heavy.  Katana X is light, as is the Scimitar.  Go with what makes you happy, and comfortable, but I prefer shotguns.  Adjust accordingly in ""Krogan Battlemaster"" if you aren't taking a shotgun into battle.

**THAT'S IT! YOU ARE READY TO MURDER SQUISHY LITTLE THINGS! Just remember! Fight smart! You're not invincible, even though we tell the soft little ones we are! HEH HEH HEH!!**

Since there are always posts every few days asking for advice for getting started out, I decided to put a thread together that the Mods have offered to sticky to the sidebar for new players to check out.  

**EDIT**: Updated as of October 23, 2012

**1.  Getting started**

ME Co-Op is first and foremost a team game.  This means you live or die by the quality of your team.  You need to work together in order to succeed, especially on the higher levels.  The other thing you really, really need to learn from the beginning is that **POINTS DON’T MATTER.**  The scoreboard is there, of course, but at the end of the match all points are aggregated and experience is divided equally.  Points make you feel like you did more but they don’t really matter.  Be a team player.


Each match consists of 10 rounds + 1 extraction round.  Each wave is more difficult than the last.  On Waves 3, 6, and 10 you will have one of five possible objectives.  


* Hack: you have to find the hacking terminal and activate it to start the hack.  You must stand in the hacking circle in order for the bar to fill up.  You have a limited time to do this.  **It is almost always the best idea for all four party members to stand in the circle and defend it.**  Four players hacking make the progress bar increase significantly faster.  Enemies also spawn infinitely while you are hacking so the longer it takes, the more enemies you have to fight.  Anyone who is outside the circle running around fighting their private war is almost always not a team player.  Wave 10 hacking missions are widely considered the bane of all players’ existences.  This is why it is so important for everyone to hack: the faster it goes the better off you are.  Also, if you attract all the enemies to same place you can more effectively Cobra nuke them.


* Capture: this involves running around the map and activating four different devices by standing there and holding down the activation button.  The devices are randomly spawned around the map and must be activated sequentially.  Strategies for this include all four players going to the device and guarding it while one player activates.  However, a more effective strategy on harder difficulties is having one player, preferably a cloaked Infiltrator, activate the device while the rest of the team “aggros” (aggravates/draws the enemy into attacking) them somewhere else.


* Assassinate: this involves sequentially killing four randomly assigned enemy units.  You have a fairly limited amount of time to do this although you gain extra time for each assassinated target.


* Collect Objective: this was newly introduced in the Rebellion DLC (May 29, 2012).  This involves collecting two objectives, one at a time, and walking it back to the drop-off point.   You cannot run while holding the objective, as you will drop it immediately if you do.  If you are cloaked you will also immediately de-cloak.  You can otherwise take cover and move normally.  This is pretty straight-forward: one person collects and the others protect.  The second objective spawns randomly as soon as you return the first one.  

* Escort: you must run to a designated spot on the map and activate a drone.  The drone then makes it way to another spot on the map as long as a player is next to it.  The drone moves faster if there are more players near it and the drone will periodically recharge your shields.  Escort missions can be tough as it necessarily draws you out into the open.

You are awarded credits after each successful objective wave and bonus credits based on how fast you do it.  Even if you all die and fail the mission, you will receive credits for the completed objective waves.  Non-objective waves offer no credits at all.  If you are incapacitated you come back to life at the end of each wave.


The extraction wave is last and involves being in the extraction circle at the end of two minutes.  It is not necessary to be in the circle for the whole two minutes, but you must be there at the end to get a full extraction experience bonus.  There is 10% credit bonus for successfully extracting yourself, i.e., as long as you extract you get the bonus credits.


The game has four levels of difficulty: Bronze (easiest), Silver, Gold, and Platinum (hardest).  The game’s default setting is to match you to ANY level of difficulty.  Do yourself a favour and select Bronze when you are first starting out.  Even after you have lots of experience, Bronze is the best way for experimenting and trying out a new class.  There are fewer enemies, they are easier, and you will spend more time fighting and less time dead.  


Winning matches raises your Galactic Readiness Score in single player.  If you have 100% GRS in multiplayer, you get a 5% experience bonus per match.


**2.  Consumables**

In the game you have 4 types of consumables, Cobra Missiles, Ops Packs, Medi Gels, and Thermal Clips.  These are all limited use items.  You carry a limited number into battle and these are drawn from your total pool of these items.  Items you don’t use in a match go back into your pool but if your total pool is empty you won’t bring any into the match.  

**EDIT:** Some additional pointers in Thermal and Ops packs thanks to Chetyre


* Cobra Missiles: these are Instant Kill emergency weapons.  They will instantly kill any enemy they hit in a fairly large radius.  They will NOT damage you or your team mates as there is no friendly fire.  DO NOT waste these on small easy enemies or even large groups of easy enemies.  These should be reserved for Banshees, packs of Geth Pyros, pairs of Phantoms, etc.  Also, don’t waste Cobras when you are working on an Atlas or some other heavy and it’s the last unit.  Just kill it with conventional weapons.  If you are running out of time on an Assassinate objective, Cobras are very useful for quickly taking out an enemy.  Cobras often miss if your aim is poor or there is a lot of lag.  You can help yourself by firing at the feet of the enemy.


* Ops Packs: these instantly restore your health and shields.  Use carefully though.  Sometimes there is a split second of lag and you may use the pack and still die.  Take cover first.  Ops packs can basically double your Medi Gel capacity if your timing is good.


* Medi Gels: these instantly revive you when you are incapacitated.  Be very careful using these as Medi Gels and Cobras are probably the most used items and therefore in the shortest supply.  DO NOT waste these on wave 1 or by popping it instantly.  It’s a good idea to keep spamming the spacebar (or equivalent) until you’re nearly out of time and then use it; this gives time for team mates to come revive you.  Keep in mind that sometimes it is better to stay down.  If there are two Geth Primes standing on your body, you will be killed instantly if you revive, so don’t waste your Medi Gel.


* Thermal Packs: these instantly refill your ammo.  You won’t likely use these much as ammo is generally plentiful around the map.  However, try to space out where you refill as if everyone grabs ammo from the same crate there won’t be any until more respawns (usually 20-30 seconds?).  Thermal packs also refill your grenades.  


There are also weapon, ammunition, and armor powers that can be used to give you a bonus for the duration of one match.  As of the new patch, there is now a description of what the bonus does.

**EDIT:** Weapon bonuses only apply to the specific weapon type.  So for example, shotgun rails give bonuses to shotguns, not a shotgun damage bonus to any weapon.  Ammo powers, however, do apply to any weapon you choose. *thanks to JadeEmpress for this clarification*


**3. Characters**

There are six classes of characters: Adept, Soldier, Sentinel, Engineer, Infiltrator, and Vanguard.  Within each class are several different races.  When you gain levels by earning experience, you level up the entire class not the individual unit.  This means that if you level a Krogan Soldier to 20 (the maximum) then if you create a Human Soldier she will be level 20 automatically.


You put points into skills, just like in single player.  Pay very close attention to the skills and which evolutions you want at skill level 4,5 and 6.  Read about them from some of the many guides available online for the classes.  Once you spend a skill point you can’t undo it unless you use a respec card (limited items) or promote the class.

**EDIT:** At level 20, you'll have the ability to skill yourself with four skills at max rank with the fifth at no points. Most common builds will be something like 6/6/6/6/0 or 6/6/6/5/3. Note I'm NOT saying that's how you should spend your points for every class, just that most people either do max 4 skills or max 3 with 5 and 3 in the remaining two. *thanks to Chetyre*


When a class reaches level 20, you can “promote” it.  Promoting gives you +10 to your N7 score and gives you 75 war assets in the single player game.  Promoting resets the class to level 1 and you must level it up again.  Your N7 score is calculated from the combined levels of all your classes plus previous N7 scoring.  N7 scores don’t necessarily mean much but can be a quick-and-dirty indicator of player “skill” or at least, experience in the game (time played).  That being said, some people never promote so are very good with low N7 scores and some people are awful with N7 scores in the multi-hundreds.  With the latest patch when you promote all the skills points for that class are unassigned, so you don't have the 1 default point assigned.  This is a good thing.

Please read this for important changes!,228,31,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/szvs6/hey_coopers_please_read_this_for_important_changes/,"As of now, we will begin a trial of filtering out Memes, picture posts of packages/characters/results sreens, threads started for the purpose only to complain and rant, and so on. This community was built for many reasons: Helping new people get used to the MP, posting tips/hints/tricks/starts to playing the MP, finding others to play with, and more. Recently, the front page has been cluttered with more memes, rants, and pictures than actual MP talk.

We would like all memes to be posted to ~~/r/masseffect~~ /r/masseffectmeme for now. THIS IS NOT A PERMA BAN ON MEMES. We will soon get a poll to see who does or does not want memes. We are here to make this place the best we can, and as some of our members have brought to our attention, memes bring little to the actual subreddit other than karma and a quick chuckle or annoying sigh and a downvote.

Please stop and think before you post a rant. This is a positive place and there is NO ACCEPTANCE of hate/racism(krogan are people too)/descrimination/sexism. Rants also bring very little to the subreddit. A post doing nothing but complaining about a player, a group of players, krogans being large, and other simply negative posts will are not welcome. Giving advice to the krogans about not standing in front of other players is okay as long as it is not negative or rude.

Pictures of your packages, character unlocks, gun levels, and so on are also something that may be considered MECoOP specific but bring little to the actual subreddit. It is very nice you got your Black Widow to X but we didn't need to know. Tell us how the X level BW works and it is okay. Also, pictures with text in them that could simply be used in a text based post should not be used normally just to farm Karma.

Again, we will NOT be banning people or memes as of right now. This is a TRIAL period. Mods will be talking this over and the poll will be up soon. Thanks and please voice your thoughts in the comments and BE KIND and RESPECTFUL. Thanks!

Edit: Also, please upvote this, I recieve no karma and this needs to be seen!

Edit 2: Also, please do not downvote posts for people asking actual questions, commenting on the topic at hand, and anything that does contribute to the subreddit or conversation. The downvote should be used if the person or post does not contribute to the subreddit/conversation, if they are rude or negative, and so on.

Edit 3: Thanks for all the feedback. Again, these changes are not offcial nor are they staying for sure. The mods still need time to see how the community is reacting and feels about this. So far, as I have read, rants are about a 50/50 good/bad ratio. Memes are around a 20/80 good/bad as are pictures. Some think that if we take out the memes, negative rants, pictures of items and packages, and so on, it will ruin our subreddit. I disagree. Many places have taken out memes and it has worked well. I don't want this place to become a go to place for memes and a quick laugh. This place was made for people who enjoy the multiplayer and want to talk, help, and get help from other people. If you want memes, plase go to /r/masseffect or /r/masseffectmeme. Also, lets not push all memes to /r/masseffect but instead push them to /r/masseffectmeme where they are 100% welcome.

Thank you all and please know we are regarding your input with every intention of keeping this place amazing. Keep up the awesome attitudes, actions, and posts. Us mods are not here to run this place but to help govern the content that flows through. This is not an attempt to simply take out memes and the like because we don't like them. I have seen MANY people talk about the overflowing amount of pictures and memes and useless rants (not the thoughtful kind) taking over. Our purpose is to make this place as enjoyable as can be to people who love MEMP as much as we do.

A couple of months ago I had a stroke that affected by right side. I could not sign my name, had slightly blurry vision on the right, and therefore couldn’t play worth crap.

I had a number of physical therapy options to choose from, one of which I decided was continuing to play ME3 Coop. Armed with the knowledge that our brains will migrate certain functions to alternate areas, I began working on using my right arm and hand motor functions as much as possible. I also need to use a cane, but that’s also improving.

The good news is that my right arm and hand motor functions have completely returned. The brain is an amazing thing. So is gaming for this kind of problem. Now I’m more or less back to normal on my right side, and I’ve even moved on from just playing bronze to playing a lot of silver.

I think soloing on bronze for a long time before the stroke helped me, but I’m not sure. But I do know that gaming has helped me recover, and may be the single most effective element next to determination. If any of you have played with me then you may have noticed that I often thank the players when I leave. Now you know why.

So when people say that gaming isn’t valuable in life, you can tell them to piss off if you like. Just tell them *horsedragon* sent you.

Hey everyone, I regret to announce that we will no longer be releasing any more balance updates. There are many things we wish we had time to fix and improve, but as Jonathan Warner mentioned in Bioware’s blog post here (http://blog.bioware.com/2013/03/22/blog-the-multiplayer-team-retrospective/), the team is moving on to new and exciting projects.

I just wanted to say that our team has really enjoyed interacting with the community this past year through weekend events, balance changes, and discussions on the forums. We learned a lot about running a multiplayer service, and the community definitely taught us a lot about our own game through amazing gameplay videos and in depth analysis of our weapons, powers, and kits. I know Mass Effect 3 multiplayer was a bit controversial when it was announced, but I think it’s safe to say it was a huge success. 

Although weekend events and balance changes are finished, you will still see us around the forums. Thanks for playing!

Its always the same missions with just different characters and 1 new gametype, the Pizza Delivery. While I like Bioware for trying, I just think we need more full missions instead of just Horde mode-style games.

My idea: Take missions and locations from ME3 (possibly even some ME2 locations, if they are bold enough) and have people take a 4-man team to complete objectives within them. It would be a lot like a mix of a ME3 mission plus the MP teaming/enemy waves fighting, but with the team moving along the path and with areas getting more difficult as the mission progresses. Each map would have 1-2 unique missions specific to that location.

The first thing that comes to mind for me would be the mission on Palaven's moon when you meet up with Garrus.

---------

**Start Mission**

**Wave 1:** after the team lands, you have to take out all the enemies in the area. Once the Area is secure, you can move up the path just ahead to face...

**Wave 2:** Take out more enemies, continue on path. Once you reach the operating base (empty except of NPCs for the devs to save on resources), you enter, but then...

**Waves 3-5:** complete a few waves here, holding off enemies before doing an ""objective"" mission-like ""hack the computer"" or ""enable the 4 devices. Something like that.

**Wave 6:** Defend the wall. A new Objective type exclusive to this map. Enemies will come from over the wall, trying to assault the base. The team has to stop them WITHOUT a heavy turret on top (otherwise its too easy). Its basically a destroy the enemies wave, but the wall takes damage over time from enemies. BUT if its destroyed, then I think the enemy numbers in later waves double instead of a ""Mission Failed"" screen. But thats an opinion I have. Anyway...

**Wave 7:** Head up to the AA gun and ""Hack the Point,"" standing around the tower while holding off enemies.

**Wave 8:** Staying in the area, you defend it from an enemy wave.

**Wave 9:** get back to the base you came from and destroy the enemies that entered from the nearby airfield

**Wave 10:** Pizza delivery time! This time you have to carry 2 items from the base to the airfield nearby. this is tricky because there is only ONE way over, so you have to work as a team to get the package there.

**Extraction wave:** Stay in the LZ at the airfield and hold out. enemies will come from all around it, not just over a wall area.

**Mission Accomplished!**

-----------

As you see from my idea, this basically uses resources from the first part of that ME3 mission. While I liked that whole mission/location, I realize its a challenge for devs to turn real missions like Palaven into MP maps.

But with this game-mode, its less of a Horde mode and more of a teamwork style game.

Of course this all depends on IF the servers are more stable; people being able to drop in/out; and also if these are paid or free missions (because of all the hate for Bioware at the moment).

So, what does MECoOp think of my idea? Also, what ideas would YOU want to see in ME3 MP?

**TL;DR** - Remember Palaven, the ME3 mission? Yeah, imagine it as 4 player co-op, kinda. Thats my idea

EDIT: Some clarifications.

1. I'm not saying these would just be SP missions with 4 players. I'm saying to take SP levels and missions and use them to make a form of MP mission system. Like Battlefield 3 or CoD. Maybe those are bad examples, but they took in-game segments of the SP experience and made them multiplayer. And it worked!

2. This would definitely need to be a new MP mode just so people looking for Classic MP won't get thrown into wave 10 of this type of a game. Thats annoying enough as it is now with standard MP.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1339449132.0,,,True,t3_uwjnf,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/uwjnf/me3_needs_coop_missions_not_just_maps/,

1335885056.0,98,self.MECoOp,t1k15,The Biotic Throwdown: in-depth human sentinel tactics and character building,116,18,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/t1k15/the_biotic_throwdown_indepth_human_sentinel/,"Sentinel has been my favorite class since ME2. I was discouraged when I started reading that it was one of the worst classes in ME3 multiplayer a month or two ago. After I had finished the game and subsequently repressed any knowledge I had of the ending, I started playing multiplayer and discovered after a week or two that human sentinel was by no means bad, and although I've spent a lot of time playing as all six classes, human sentinel remains my favorite. So it makes me sad when I see people saying it's bad or that tech armor sucks or what have you, and makes me even sadder when I join a pub and see someone playing human sentinel finish at the bottom of the scoreboard. When played correctly, the only class that should be outscoring a human sentinel is a good infiltrator. I've posted a lot of information on the class in various threads in the past, so I've finally taken all the useful stuff from previous comments of mine and coalesced it into one topic that I hope will serve as Human Sentinel Mecca for the next day or two.

All right, so let's get the build out of the way first so we can then move onto the more interesting  stuff. [Check it.](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#30ORKIDO9@0) This build utilizes maxed tech armor, which is the first point I want to make: **tech armor is your friend.** A lot of people see the cooldown penalty and immediately get it in their head that TA is a bad tradeoff. That's reasonable, considering how important it is for powers-based classes to get 200% cooldown bonus. Let's take a look at the actual numbers here though: the difference in warp cooldown between a human sentinel with 200% and 170% cooldown is .2 seconds. The difference in throw cooldown is .13 seconds. This is so negligible that it can't with any honesty be counted as a genuine disadvantage, especially considering what you gain. Rank 5 of tech armor provides you with a 20% boost to power force and damage. This is a very important distinction for people who start comparing the class to asari adept (**also, I'm in no way trying to invalidate the awesomeness of asari adept in this thread, it's a great class that I thoroughly enjoy playing. However, I believe that although they have similar abilities, human sentinel and asari adept actually play fairly differently in practice, and hope to make the distinctions clear to people who think they are clones of each other**). The alliance training tree offers a 35% boost to power force and damage. The asari justicar tree offers a 45% bonus. So if you're playing a 0/6/6/6/6 sentinel that doesn't have the boost that tech armor gives them, they are essentially an asari adept with weaker powers, no stasis, and more health. Adressing the issue of health/shields, you gain an almost identical amount of effective health/shields with 30% DR in tech armor and 3 in fitness as you would with no DR and 6 in fitness. I'm not the best at math, so I'm not sure whether to add 30% or divide by 70%, and in either situation one comes out slightly ahead of the other, but it's a less than 100 point difference total either way, so it's negligible. In summation, the only thing you are gaining by eschewing tech armor for fitness is .2 seconds of warp cooldown, .1 seconds of throw cooldown, and 20% weaker powers. Don't do it, because that boost to power damage is crucial when it comes to your main weapon: throw.

That's right, say it with me folks: **throw.** Throw. Throw, throw, throw (in case you haven't noticed, we have officially segued from boring build discussion into awesome gameplay strategies), throw, throw. **This is what you do as human sentinel. You throw.** You throw as many things as you can, as often as you can. Think of each throw you toss as a mini vanguard you're sending charging at enemies every 1.36 seconds.Asari adepts have a lot more options than throw for dealing with enemies, and they tend to use them. As a human sentinel with the most powerful throw in the game, you don't *need* those other options. Why? Well, because you have a throw, of course. Obviously, biotic explosions are an incredibly useful ability to have, but on any enemy without protection, you shouldn't waste your time. Those enemies are not worth your time. The only thing they are good for is getting thrown. You can decimate entire groups of unprotected enemies with just your throw. Even on gold, you should be able to one-shot enemies with it, provided you curve it correctly so it smacks them into a wall or sends them flying off an elevated area. The strategy that I like to use with my phalanx is to toss a throw, then pop off a few headshots while it's en route to ensure the throw kills, then rinse and repeat. It's one of the most efficient ways of laying waste to groups of trash mobs in the entire game. Throw curving becomes something of an art form, but it's not that hard to get used to, and soon you'll instinctively be moving your crosshairs in whatever direction will curve the throw to send your target flying into something that will painfully introduce them to Newton's Third Law of Motion.

Hopefully, this has captured some of the fast-paced aggressive nature I feel the human sentinel should be played with. This is another difference I find between the asari adept and human sentinel. When I play asari, I tend to be more reserved and calculating. I'll freeze groups of enemies I see firing at my teammates with stasis. I'll provide covering fire with my carnifex. I will occasionally throw and I will use biotic explosions on large targets. I tend to stick very close to my teammates and stay in one spot in cover for much longer. But when I play human sentinel, I'm not focused on support so much as I am focused on moving around and fucking everything I see's shit up as fast as humanly possible. That's what the human sentinel is, an asari adept that's focused on pure offense rather than a balance of offense and support. **Your sole purpose as human sentinel is to nuke the fuck out of everything with your powers until nothing is left to stand against you.** You can be more aggressive because of your additional health and shields, coupled with the extremly important fact that your dodge roll doesn't reset your shield recharge (more on this and why it's important later). Where an asari adept is going to be supporting with stasis and detonations from safely behind or alongside the rest of her teammates, a human sentinel is going to be blazing the trail ahead of them, deftly moving from cover to cover while dodging weapons fire and cutting through groups of enemies like a knife. Most classes are afraid of banshees. When a human sentinel sees a banshee, his eyes turn into 2 dollar signs an an audible ""cha-ching!"" sound is heard. Between your biotic explosions and your godlike throw, you have an answer to everything as human sentinel.

Now, it's time to meet your greatest enemy, the only thing human sentinels truly fear: a gameplay mechanic called the combat roll. The combat roll will be the bane of your existence against about 3/4 of the enemies in the game. They will clumsily roll or hop slightly to the right as your warp fizzles harmlessly out on the ground next to them. They will throw off your rhythm and destroy your efficiency, but only if you let them. Protip: don't let them. Say, ""Fuck your combat roll son, I ain't no punk bitch human sentinel, I AM A **BIOTIC GOD, A TECH ARMORED DARK ENERGY SLINGER THE LIKES OF WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN!**"" Do not let the combat roll make you its bitch. Kill the combat roll's parents and feed them to the combat roll in the form of chili.

The first and best way to shit in the combat roll's mouth is to simply avoid using warp on any enemies with a combat roll to set up your biotic explosions. For example, the only reapers that can dodge are marauders. Inconveniently, the fastest way to kill a marauder is with a biotic explosion. But if there's a cannibal in somewhat close proximity to the marauder, you can hit them with the warp since they can't dodge at all, then detonate it, which will kill all cannibals and husks in the radius and at the very least strip the marauder's shields. The marauder will then be staggered from the explosion and can easily be deprived of saving Shepard from the horror of the ending with a single throw.

Now, there won't always be enemies that don't have the ability to dodge in the immediate range of the ones you want to kill. In that case, you're going to want to **stagger them with your weapon by popping off a couple quick headshots until they flinch, then immediately fire off a warp.** The phalanx is the perfect gun for this because of its fast firing rate. It will stagger targets very quickly and ensure they can't dodge your warp. Even if they dodge the followup throw, the throw cooldown is so fast it will be finished by the time you've even seen them dodge the first one and you can toss another one to seal the deal. Punk bitches can't dodge twice.

Against cerberus and the geth, the headshot stagger tactic comes into play much more, since almost all enemies can dodge. If you see an atlas or a turret against cerberus, you can use them to set up dodge-free explosions to slay anything remotely near them. Geth primes are the only geth without any sort of a dodge, but cloaked hunters tend to almost never dodge until they've run out of shields and decloaked, so they make excellent warp targets. You simply need to shoot them with your weapon to light them up and make them flicker, then your warp will be able to lock on.

**HAPPY ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY, MASS EFFECT 3!**
-
*POSTED ON MARCH 7, 2013 BY BIOWARE*

Months have passed and seasons have changed since we released Mass Effect 3—many of which here in Edmonton containing snow—and yet it’s still hard to believe that an entire year has gone by! From beginning to end it has been an amazing experience, and we were so happy to be able to keep Mass Effect 3 alive with additional single-player and multiplayer DLC.

We dove further into Commander Shepard’s adventure with the From Ashes, Leviathan, Omega and Citadel single-player DLCs and introduced new allies and enemies along the way. Players got to meet Javik, the last surviving Prothean, learn more about the origin of the Reapers, and revisit the Omega space with Aria. We also saw an opportunity to expand upon the events at the end of Commander Shepard’s journey with the Extended Cut DLC.

We are extremely proud of the work done by our multiplayer team, who has supported players with five add-on packs and weekly challenges over the last twelve months. Over 40 new kits, 10+ new maps, and dozens of new weapons and upgrades.  And let’s not forget the Collectors, and entirely new enemy faction and the return of the dreaded Praetorian.

To help us in celebrating this milestone, our multiplayer team has provided two new updates that we’d like to share with you.

First, is the “Stood Fast, Stood Strong, Stood Together” banner, which can be earned by participating in Operation: LODESTAR and completing the second-tier challenges.  This banner features the entire cast of Mass Effect’s multiplayer mode.

[http://blog.bioware.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/FinalChallengeBanner.jpg](http://blog.bioware.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/FinalChallengeBanner.jpg)

Second, is an all-new infographic with updates on the multiplayer war front.

So, on behalf of the team here at BioWare, thank you for making this one incredible year, and thank you for your continued love and support!

With the last DLC looming, it feels like the end of an era for me. I know its not strictly rule abiding, but I felt like I needed to say something. I will be praying that the mods are merciful on me today.

My story with mass effect is an odd one. I had no previous experience with the mass effect series, but my best friend *loved* it. (I still haven't played through mass effect 2 single player yet as of today). He would constantly be playing it, while I played vidyas alone. I didn't have any interest in mass effect then, but one day we got into an argument over the fact that he wouldn't ever play any vidya with me. So I promptly went out and bought it there and then. Didn't tell him, until I called him on skype later and waited till he logged into PSN and saw what I was playing. Dude was on the verge of tears he was so moved by the fact I had bought a game for no other reason other than to play with him, while I biotic charged someone on bronze and had no idea wtf had just happened. That person is known here as Exxtrooper.

Then I discovered /r/MeCoOp shortly after the Resurgence DLC came out. I lurked for a bit, then started posting. It was like no other community I had ever been a part of before. I learnt so much from here, and exxtrooper practically being my personal teacher, I was soon playing gold pugs in no time at all. I had my first post removed by Carbon, and I called everyone out on the 'geth were buffed' threads. I continued posting though, and made a few builds, and made more friends over PSN to play with.

Drellstep, FBWGG, Krysae, Piranha, vanguard glitches, Glacier box of shame, hard infiltrator nerfs and then the infamous buffing of the geth later, and I became a moderator of this place. Carbon started having IRL things to deal with, and the subreddit began to become unregulated. I piped up and offered to help out, with success. On the 25th of august 2012, I was added as a mod, and as the new mods can verify through the mod logs, I pretty much single handedly regulated the sub. A few months later, I starting having IRL frustrations myself, and took it out on some stupid balance change. Regrettably, a huge fight in a rant thread was had, words were said and enemies were made. I explained some shit to InterwebNinja and RepublicanShredder, who both listened to what I had to say. And for that, I greatly appreciate it. However, I knew it was time to pass the baton. 

RepShred was a mod ever since it crossed my mind. I promised him that. I did feel like I should 'recruit' more than one mod though, given black ops 2 was round the corner, and I intended to leave the game for good (Turns out, call of duty is still shit, so I came back naturally). I made a post announcing that SWfanboy and Pantsonhead were to be the new supreme rulers. A decision I have no regretted. This place is better than it ever has been. And I speak for all of us when I say that the 3 mods of this place do a fantastic job. I can't praise them enough. We are over 5000 members strong now. Something which would not have been possible without the changes that were invoked. So to RepublicanShredder, ImNotASWFanboy and PantsOnHead719, congratulations for giving this community the lifespan it has gotten. 

None of you really have any idea how much of a getaway from my personal life this community has been, and is. Now that I think about it, if me and Exxtrooper hadn't have had that argument that day, none of this would ever have happened. 

So you can stop downvoting all our shit now for no reason whatsoever. Hurts our feelings you know.

Seriously though. Thankyou. Thank you all for making me so happy and proud to be a part of something great.

1358761312.0,95,self.MECoOp,16zcwq,ME Co-Op College 501:  Making the Jump to Gold,110,15,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16zcwq/me_coop_college_501_making_the_jump_to_gold/,"####OVERVIEW

This guide is a compilation of information relevant to making the jump from Bronze / Silver up to Gold.  It assumes you have knowledge of the game's basic mechanics as covered in earlier articles in this series.  While this information applies to all difficulties, it is particularly relevant for higher difficulties.

The guide starts with some of the mechanics you will want to consider when designing builds, and then covers good build / loadout strategies and playstyle considerations.

#### MECHANICS

There are a few more advanced mechanics which are important to understand before making decisions on your builds and loadouts in Gold+.  They are covered here briefly.

***Enemy Armor***

When shooting against enemy armor, your weapons will take a flat damage penalty depending on the diffiulty:

* Gold / Platinum - 50
* Silver - 30
* Bronze - 15

At higher difficulties, this can have significant effects on your damage output, especially on weapons with a low damage-per-bullet.  Many guns take a huge hit to their damage output without some sort of anti-armor mod, equipment, or ability.  Note, most shotgun shots are 8 individual pellets, and each pellet suffers the armor penalty.  There are ways to mitigate this, and they will be covered below.

***Shieldgate***

When you attack an enemy with shields / barriers, if the bullet does enough damage to destroy the shields / barriers, only a percentage of the remaining damage passes on to the enemy's health / armor.  On Gold, this percentage is 25%.

For example, if an enemy had 200 remaining shields, and you fired a shot that did 1000 damage, the first 200 would strip the shields, and the remaining 800 would be reduced to 800 * 0.25 = 200.  Thus, a shot that would normally do 1000 damage only does 400 damage in total.

This is important to consider when speccing for high damage-per-bullet weapons (e.g. single-shot sniper rifles).  If your first shot doesn't do enough to strip an enemy's shields, your second shot ends up wasting a lot of damage.  Phasic Ammo is useful for overcoming this issue, as it offers huge boosts to shield / barrier damage.  

Note, shotguns are also effective against the shieldgate mechanic, as only one pellet will suffer the shieldgate penalty.

***Cooldown***

Based on the weapons and mods you equip, you will see your Power Recharge Speed Bonus change on the weapons screen.  This number is misleading, as the formula for power cooldowns is not linear.  That is, the difference between 200% and 150% is not the same as the difference between 150% and 100%.  In the former case, for a power with a relatively long base cooldown like Biotic Charge (10 seconds), the difference is about 0.6 seconds.  In the latter case, the difference would be about 1.0 second.

In practice, this means the difference between having a 200% Power Recharge Speed Bonus and an 180% one is often negligible, especially for powers with quick cooldowns.  Generally speaking, a 200% bonus should not be a goal when deciding on your loadouts, even on caster classes.  You are often likely to get more benefit from carrying a better / heavier weapon and suffering a penalty to your cooldown.

If you want to see more numbers on the cooldowns, reference [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgplnRtUmXxmdEtsUmZSZDRtTVM5SUtLQ3gxTVc2U1E#gid=1) spreadsheet (note:  Sabotage has had its base cooldown reduced from 14 seconds to 10 seconds).

One other thing to note with respect to the Power Recharge Speed Bonus is that it is bugged for the weapon mods that add weight.  For any weapon that was not released through DLC, this weight bonus will not work.  For example, you can get the benefit of a mod like the Heavy Barrel on the Carnifex without having to suffer the weight penalty.

***Combos***

While knowing which powers are capable of priming and detonating Biotic or Tech combos is critical, there are some other helpful things to know about these combos.  First, each combo type can receive a 2x bonus to its damage, depending on the enemy protection.  The table below lists each type of combo, as well as the multiplier it receives against each enemy defense type.

Power|Health|Barriers|Shields|Armor
:---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
Biotic|1|2|1|2
Fire|1|1|1|2
Tech|1|1|2|1
Cryo|1|1|1|1

As a side note, Snap Freeze is bugged, and as a result, Cryo Explosions primed by it receive a 2x multiplier against all enemy defenses.

Another important thing to note with respect to combos is that the strength of explosions depends on the rank of the powers used to prime / detonate them.  Two rank 6 powers used to prime / detonate will have a much stronger explosion than two rank 3 powers.  For this reason, it is usually advisable to put 6 points into powers that will primarily be used for priming / detonating combos.  Note, combos primed by Ammo powers (Incendiary, Cryo, or Disruptor) are the same as combos primed by a rank 1 power.  In addition, Ammo powers are not guaranteed to prime a target, but higher rank Ammos have a higher probability to prime.  The likelihood of priming a target varies by Ammo rank and gun.  Projectile weapons (e.g. Falcon, Graal, Kishock, Acolyte) prime at a 100% rate, but results vary with other weapons.  The best practice is to just watch the enemy.  You will be able to see the effect when they have been primed.

Powers and Ammo that prime can layer on top of each other.  That means that if a teammate throws Warp on a target and you then hit it with Overload, the Overload is sitting on top of Warp and is the active power waiting to be detonated.  Thus, the next detonator thrown at the target will set off a Tech Burst rather than a Biotic Explosion.  This scenario would be unfavorable against an armored defense, as the Biotic Explosion would be much more powerful than the Tech Burst against armor.  If the target is hit by a second detonating biotic power, though, a Biotic Explosion will be set off (provided Warp's priming effect is still active).  This principle applies to some Ammo (Disruptor, Cyro, Incendiary) as well - they can layer on top of other primers (though Cryo will only prime / override on targets down to health).

Finally, the bonus to explosion strength upgrades that you see in many powers (e.g. Throw, Shockwave) are multiplicative bonuses (as opposed to most bonuses in the game, which are additive) and should almost always be taken.  The bonuses for Electric Slash and Snap Freeze are bugged, though, so don't bother taking those *(edit - testing reveals that the multiplicative tech combo bonus on the AIU works (evolution 6a), so it's definitely worth considering)*.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1374130467.0,,PS3,True,t3_16zcwq,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16zcwq/me_coop_college_501_making_the_jump_to_gold/,

He also found that scions are doing double damage on each of their cannon shots, which explains why they've been two-shotting krogans. And the devs have just recently confirmed that these are actually bugs and figured out what's causing it.

So yeah, if the collectors feel a lot harder, it's because *they actually are*.

A user from GameFAQ played with a Bioware employee earlier today, here's what he had to say after a few hours of play
&gt;We played unknown/reapers on gold for almost 10 straight hours, with his friends and my friends shuffling through the party.


&gt;I bombarded him with a lot of questions, some I may have forgotten, but here is what I remember:

&gt;Vanguard glitch cannot be fixed without a huge overhaul of the original programming, which they will never do. He said if you were about to charge an enemy that is behind cover, and you go down, the game thinks you are inside of the cover, hence you fall through the map. I did not know this! He said they could put a patch in that would simply not allow you to charge places that could result in glitches, but that this would render vanguards useless and unfun
He mentioned that they could not simply reset a glitched player without having to overhaul the programming.

&gt;When I asked him about smash being overpowered he mentioned that it has already been talked about and that the most likely nerf would be to the recharge speed, but that they haven't made a decision on it yet.

&gt;He confirmed the studio is aware ultralight materials still do not work but they haven't figured out what is causing the bug and that simply adding more code would not fix the problem because it would overlap with the existing one.

&gt;Mass effect mp suffers regular server overload during the heavier traffic times of the day. So if you think your connection is just acting funny, think again!

&gt;There is a natural handicap built into the mp so that the person leading the scoreboard has a 100% chance of getting ohko'd during a grab sequence, whereas the person in fourth has a mere 25% chance of actually activating the grab.

&gt;Another handicap is rocket troopers, who selectively fire at the player with the most points, however they only fire at players they are aware of, so the leader isn't being hunted. They also have a greater frequency of firing double rockets at the leader, In case you've ever been surprised by that.

&gt;I didn't know this, he told me the paladin's shield has its own health limit and will need to regenerate if you go over it. 

&gt;When I asked if earth would be the last mp dlc he actually laughed at me and explained they are making way more money developing mp content than they would single player content, though both are being made. 

&gt;When I commented that I wish there were new opponents, he confirmed the studio was already working on a new faction. He also says they have written plans on making 4 player cooperative missions that play like the single player, but he said that it was at a very early stage of development and cannot be guaranteed.

&gt;Very cool guy, we spoke a lot about how games get made and whether it is a good job and what the work is like, he gave very detailed answers to all of it and knew biowares history as a studio extremely well.

&gt;(sorry for any typos)

&gt;If I remember anything else I'll add it to this post, but I think I got it all.

 Have you been looking for a bad-ass build that melts damn commie ass like no other? Look no further than Liberty Prime! His face-melting prowess is unparalleled by any other build. Now let's get to the meat of the build.

-Hex Shield-
    You know who hides behind shields? Not you. You didn't choose an eight-foot tall ass-frying monstrosity to hide behind a wall like a little girl did you? Bitches hide behind shields. Don't be a bitch.

-Seige Pulse-
    There's nothing better than a big bad-ass gun that turns your enemies into little piles of gooey freedom. That's what this gun is. Freedom. You want to take radius, to spread this freedom over the greatest area possible. Next you want the DR. You've probably figured out by now that this build is all about melting bitches. You've also probably figured out that you can't melt bitches when you're dead. Whether you take more shots or damage is your choice, that's what freedom is all about (also I don't know which one is better).

-Geth Turret-
    As a big wonderful hulking war machine, you can't always get around that fast. With a damage specced turret, you can spread freedom even further. Sometimes you get tunnel vision in your face melting fury and can't take care of what's behind you. The turret can help prevent the spread of communism when you're worried elsewhere. And besides, you don't need its shield help anyways. 

-Passives-
    You'll be using the Particle Rifle here, so you don't need to worry about ammo reserves. As such you want to go for power damage, increasing your glorious commie-fryer's power even further. If you want to go for weapon damage to melt bitches that way you can go ahead.

-Fitness-
    Go for more durability here. You melee is wonderful regardless, and you can't melt bitches when you're dead.

-Weapon-
    Particle Rifle is a must. The slow speed of the class means you can't be running around to ammo boxes all the time. With the extended magazine the continuous fire bonus of the Particle Rifle gets will be even better. That plus the barrel attachment of your choice and you've got a freedom-spewing monster.

   Any comments or advice will be appreciated, the more freedom of speech the better. Be sure to deck out your giant walking patriot in the appropriate colors before use.

1338249224.0,82,self.MECoOp,u9gss,PSA About Spawning and Wave Budgets,88,6,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/u9gss/psa_about_spawning_and_wave_budgets/,"Many of us already know this, due to a thread on the subject a week or so ago, but I had a request to post this for those who missed it.
--------------------------------
Many of us assume that waves work something like this:

- Each enemy type is set to spawn a certain number of times per wave. For example, on Wave 5 the numbers might be 8 Assault Troopers, 4 Gaurdians, 1 Atlas, and so on. Each enemy type also has a maximum number that can be on the field at any given time. 

This would mean that it is not a bad idea to kill the big baddies at every available opportunity, so as to get them off the field as soon as possible. 


-------------------------

**However,** according to Bioware and independent empirical testing*  this is **not** now waves work.


The basic principles of spawning (not including spawn location mechanics, which are pretty self-explanatory) are as follows:

- **Each wave has a *wave budget,* and each enemy unit has its own budget cost.** 

- 

- **Killing a certain unit type means that another *of that same unit* will spawn to takes its place.**

- 

- **In general, the cost of units does not differ that much (**~~the range I remember being posted was only from 80 points minimum [Assault Troopers] to 200 points [Atlas]  or something like that~~ **For instance, Assault Troopers cost 20, while Atlases only cost 100), and as such is not [directly] proportional to the danger of that unit, or the amount of health they have and how difficult they are to kill.**


In other words, *the more of a certain unit you kill, the more of them you're going to see until the wave budget is depleted.* 

Further, because the cost of the big baddies like Phantoms and Banshees isn't actually *that* much more than basic mooks, it is a good idea to kill as many of the easier to kill enemies as possible before tackling the 'bosses,' to make sure that you deplete the wave budget as fast as possible and don't find yourself killing &gt;9000 Phantoms or something along those lines. 

Clearly, most of those big bads are enough of a threat that your hand is often forced into killing them so that you and your team can survive to the next wave (or at least not need to pop Medi-Gels or Ops Packs). 

*However,* it remains the case that ***it is generally better to focus on killing mooks over bosses until enemies stop spawning, as this is the fastest and easiest way to burn up the Wave Budget.*** (This may be debatable, but at least your strategy should be informed by these facts of spawning, one way or the other) 


-------------------------------

I'm not sure about the other factions, but from what I understand Guardians are perhaps the most ideal Cerberus unit for quickly depleting the wave budget, as their cost is 120 IIRC, which (also IIRC) is actually nearly the same cost as a Phantom, and they are fairly easy to kill and also easy to avoid once they respawn. Keep killing them at every opportunity (just don't let yourself get swamped by neglecting everything else either) and you should eat up the budget rather quickly. Nemesis are also good candidates, as hard as they are to chase down sometimes, as they are among the lesser threats (they really just make it easier for -other-things to kill you and can usually be evaded) but are pretty expensive.


I hope this was news to some of you, and that it helps you avoid shooting yourself in the foot by accidentally forging Phantom/Banshee/Ravager-saturated waves.

Cheers.

*Batarian Soldier*

1. From the Trailer we can see they a sort of flechette punch. This could be a unique melee animation, but if you pay attention to the first and last scenes in the trailer you can see a Batarian doing a very different animation for a heavy melee. My guess is that this is the Batarian Soldier's equivalent to Concussive Shot/Carnage. Seems to be a Graal-esque flechette burst meant for close ranges.

2. The blog mentions nets and spiked weapons but I'm willing to bet this applies to the sentinel's stasis move and the new harpoon gun, not anything specific to the soldier.

3. His version of Adrenaline Rush/Marksmanship/Fortification is unknown.

EDIT: Playstation blog mentioned 'Blade Armor' as a soldier ability which would fit into the Bioware blog's description of Batarians as fighting with spiked armor. I'm guessing something very similar to Fortification.

4. His 'grenade' is also unknown.

*Geth Infiltrator*

1. Ostensibly has tactical cloak, though it's not seen in the trailer. The blog mentions that they will 'converge quickly on a target while remaining undetected', so they obviously have some stealth mechanism. This and the video footage seen seems to imply Geth Infiltrators are less designed around sniper rifles than other infiltrators, probably taking cues from Geth Hunters.

2. They have an enhanced vision mode (as do the Geth Engineers) which spams triangles all over your screen but also highlights enemies through cover and walls (same effect as the Javelin scope, but not limited to light cover).

3. If they follow the theme of other infiltrators, their third ability will be a sort of explosive in the theme of sticky grenades and proximity mines.

*Geth Engineer*

1. Has a sentry turret, but it doesn't fire the same as the Quarian engineer's. In fact, the firing seemed very similar to the Javelin in both sound and tracer. He seems to deploy it by firing it from his gun a-la concussive shot rather than lobbing it like the quarians do. Probably has the same sort of upgrades as the Quarian turret, though, as we can see the rank 6 flamethrower. 

2. They have an enhanced vision mode (as do the Geth Infiltrators) which spams triangles all over your screen but also highlights enemies through cover and walls (same effect as the Javelin scope, but not limited to light cover).

3. Some sort of ground slam move which seems to give them a shield as they stay crouched on the ground and damages nearby enemies. Could actually be a heavy melee attack in the same vein as the Asari, given how close he is when he uses it and how troopers only marginally farther away seem completely unaffected.

EDIT: The recent blog on the Playstation site mentions Geth engineers having a shield recovery move. This could be the ground slam, if it also includes a damage component. AoE energy drain type thing? That sounds a bit crazy, but it looks to be very range limited. 

*Batarian Sentinel* 

1. Has a unique version of stasis, could be mechanically different as well but I doubt it. This is likely what the blog referred to when it mentioned that Batarians trap opponents in nets.

2. Blog also mentions bludgeoning opponents with spiked armor at close range, might be a special tech armor? Very speculative.

3. He uses shockwave later in the trailer, so my guess for his abilities are Tech Armor, Shockwave, and Net-thingy.

*Asari Justicar*

1. Large biotic bubble shield similar to the one seen during the final mission of Mass Effect 2. Ostensibly it will do a bit more than just keep bugs away in Multiplayer. If you pause it in the shot where she puts it up, bullets are still firing through the shield towards her (they could be friendly fire or the shield might just have a very brief delay before it blocks projectiles) but I'm thinking it's either a barrier for enemy movement (ie they can shoot through it but not move through it) or a zone wide damage reduction. Maybe even both, with specializations.

2. The trailer later shows an Asari using pull, so that's probably another one of their abilities.

3. Their heavy melee appears to be the same as all other Asari.

4. The blog says they excel at hit and run tactics but it's difficult to know how that might apply to the game, unless they have some sort of ability that allows them to engage/disengage from combat more easily. 

*Krogan ~~Manguard~~ Vanguard*

1. First clip seems to show he shares the usual Krogan propensity for punching things in the face real nice like.

2. They don't really show him using any special abilities other than charge, which is sort of taken for granted as a vanguard. His charge doesn't seem unique in any way.

EDIT: Playstation blog mentions one of his other abilities is Barrier.

3. Seriously though, Krogan Vanguard. There is no way this will not be the greatest stompfest of all time.

**New Maps**

*Firebase Hydra*

&gt; Firebase Hydra – Firebase Hydra is located in an old abandoned Quarian colony which humans took over when they originally settled the world of Ontarom. It has since been converted into a massive dam facility which powers the communications hub located at Firebase Dagger and the kinetic barrier which protects it. Without this critical power source, Systems Alliance communications within the entire theatre would go dark.

1. Gameplaywise it seems to bring an interesting mix of indoor and outdoor combat, which I think is a pretty awesome reference to how the artbook talked about Quarian Architecture blending indoor and outdoor spaces.

2.  Looks much more close quarters than Firebase Condor, though not small by any means. In fact it seems to rival Firebase Dagger and Giant in size.

*Firebase Condor*

&gt; Firebase Condor – A warzone outpost located on one of Palaven’s moons, Firebase Condor represents a crucial asset in the defense of the Turian homeworld, providing the beleaguered turian fleet with a place to refuel and repair. Its loss could grant the Reapers unparalleled access to the Inner Council Theatre.

1. If you played single player, this map is instantly recognizable. While the layout will probably be different, the idea will remain the same: wide open spaces punctuated by small bunkers, with lots of elevation change in the form of conveniently waist high ledges.

2. The main difference is that there appears to be two larger, more permanent looking bunkers in this map, probably located near the center.

3. It's difficult to tell the size of this map because distinguishing the actual playing area from the background isn't easy during the zoomed out shots, but the very first first 'sweep' during the trailer seems to show the entire plateau which combat takes place on, with the two bunkers in the center and open areas on either side.

4. Who comes up with these names?

**New Weapons**

*Striker Assault Rifle*

&gt;Krogan rifle with explosive rounds. Its rate of fire increases when the trigger is held.

1. This may be wishful thinking on my part but this seems to function very similarly to the original Falcon (ie: a fast firing AoE staggering monster). It fires much faster than even the pre-nerf Falcon, however, and probably does significantly less damage.

2. There doesn't appear to be any significant travel time or arc to the projectiles.

3. Depending on how you interpret the quote and video, it either has a 'build up' time to maximum rate of fire (much like the geth minigun from single player) or it operates like the Eagle and can be fired single shot or automatic depending on whether you hold the trigger down or not. Personally I'm hoping for the former, because it would be an interesting way for them to balance out the obvious disadvantage automatic weapons have against single shot weapons at the moment (by giving them higher damage overall, but with a warm up time before reaching full potential).

4. Either way, the ROF increase obviously appears to work in tiers. It doesn't gradually increase, but instantly jumps to fully automatic after the second shot and then stays there for the rest of the clip.

5. Very very low capacity (six shots?) and high rate of fire means this weapon is going to spend almost as much time reloading as shooting.

*Geth Plasma SMG*

&gt; Fully-automatic geth submachine gun. Its rate of fire increases when the trigger is held.

1. Again, the way the ROF increase works is unclear. The opening shows it transition from fast (though not necessarily automatic) fire to very very fast full auto. The next clip shows it being fire much slower (almost like a pistol) for precision when dealing with a guardian. The final clip shows it at full automatic once more.

2. Probably a lighter weight, lower damage equivalent to the Geth Assault Rifle.

*Kishock Harpoon Gun*

&gt; Deadly one-shot batarian weapon. Causes bleed-out or disruption of target.

1. Seems like a sniper, given the built in (and unique!) scope.

2. However, the scope seems to have much less zoom than most snipers (during the Batarian sentinel section), more akin to the weapon mod scopes.

3. Fires goddamn harpoons.

4. Unique melee animations show it being used almost as a sword. Maybe it has a built in melee damage bonus, much like the Widow/Black Widow have built in armor piercing mod?

1353348498.0,78,self.MECoOp,13gl1r,Three things that starting over from scratch has taught me.,89,11,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/13gl1r/three_things_that_starting_over_from_scratch_has/,"Back in August my account was deleted.  Imagine you have every character (with all appearances), every gold weapon to 10, and every black weapon unlocked.  Then, poof!  I took a break from mecoop but recently came back.  EA Support was awful, Bioware support was okay, but in the end I had to start from scratch or give up.  I quickly learned that some things are more effective than others.  I hope some of this advice will help out newcomers and veterans alike.


* **1.  You are not as skilled as you think you are.**


Think months of sniping cannibals on Gold and Platinum and earning the most points makes you a friggin' awesome player?  Wrong.  Try that with a Mantis 1 and no equipment bonuses and limited medigel/missiles and get back to me.  

The correct combination of (leveled) weapon mods, equipment bonuses, leveled weapons makes or breaks any character.  This would be a rude awakening to most players.  Even if you're good, you cannot play on Gold or Platinum without the proper equipment and weapons, unless you learn some alternate tactics (like I did).  Those follow.

* **2.  The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.**


In other words, play as a team.  When you have equipment that makes killing an enemy in a high level match tentative at best, you quickly learn that you can contribute to the team in ways that aren't dedicated to racking up points- and guess what, they're almost always superior ways of playing.

I learned quickly that the Volus characters are among the best in mecoop because of how much they ensure the team's survival.  Pay attention to how you can help your teammates; don't just score whore the whole time.  I'd rather have an abysmal 10k points at the end of a gold match and get 80k credits than have the highest score on a game ending in wave 5.  Stick with your team.  If someone goes down, drop EVERYTHING you're doing and revive them at all costs.  Use ops survival packs and their short invulnerability bonus.  Use missiles to clear baddies away from the body.  Use a thermal clip to help you drop 10 grenades at a time.  If I see someone that doesn't revive when they can, they're getting booted when the match is over.  That being said, be smart about it.  Don't kill yourself to revive someone when it's wave 2 and there's a single enemy left.

* **3.  Synergize.  Everything.**


Beyond just generally working as a team, think about how every piece of your equipment, character, teammates, level, and enemy fit together.  Some levels are better for snipers than others.  Some are easier against the Geth for certain classes than others.  While it is fun to do unknown/unknown every now and then, it's far more effective to try and think how your characters and classes work on certain levels against certain enemies.  Can't snipe well on glacier?  Use hunter mode and bump up your armor piercing capabilities.  Biotic explosions work best in close quarters.  Ravagers are incredibly dangerous at distance, but not up close.  

Also work with a friend to create synergistic builds.  Don't try and set off every cryo explosion yourself; have one person use cryo blast and the other use shockwave.  


Anyway, after about a month of play I'm working steadily towards getting everything back.  I've learned that there's a time for trying to top the scoreboards, but the game is most fun when you play as a team and actually, uh, win.  So!  Enjoy, and keep on mecooping.

1338487798.0,77,self.MECoOp,ue7qy,Different races/classes are not the way to keep people playing multiplayer. Having missions recreate key moments in Mass Effect history is the way to go. ,96,19,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/ue7qy/different_racesclasses_are_not_the_way_to_keep/,"Think of all your favorite moments in the Mass Effect games. Think of how differently you could replay those moments as different classes. Now think of how fun it would be to replay those moments as the class you want, the race you just unlocked, and with three of your friends. 

I feel that a lot of people in this subreddit are focused on what new race/classes are coming out next. Personally, I think the multiplayer experience could benefit from mission based game play, with small tie-in to previous and current Mass Effect games. 

Basically, all missions would technically take place in a training facility that would be able to work for previous and current operations. Image holodeck/danger room. This would allow current players on the PS3 to see some of the greatest moments from ME1, and also allow other players to relive awesome memories. 

I think the best way these missions would work is to have about 20 minutes of running/gunning and objectives to do in previous Mass Effect area/map that are redesigned for multiplater. These would be much more linear and straightforward, with waves of enemies and objectives placed in specific choke points. These missions would end with an extraction or mini boss challenge (time specific). 

My current idea for this kind of playing would be Virmire from ME1. Cut out the driving, focus on most of the run and gun through those sections (outside of facility, fighting your way to the bomb) and work on small objectives (disabling barriers to progress forward). Once you reach the bomb, you face Saren for a bit (think Kai Leng battle on Thessia) and then wait for evacuation while defending the bomb. 

The potential for this kind of game play is incredible. From Mass Effect 1: Contamination team dealing with rachni on Noveria, an assault team when Eden Prime is under attack. From Mass Effect 2: An assault team when Horizon is under attack, Cerberus security detail on the Collector Ship, Shadow Broker infiltration/shock troopers. From Mass Effect 3:  Defending and activating defenses against the reapers. My personal favorite idea is this: defend a battalion of Elcor soldiers while they take out Reaperized Thresher Maws and Harvesters. 

I think that this new game play style would be a great way to draw new and old players back into the multiplayer without a huge focus on grinding for credits for new races/classes. 

**TL:DR** - New style of mission based game play that would let players relive great moments and see pivotal scenes from the single player in a different light.

But most of my friends have stopped playing because the game was starting to get boring. So i've started playing a lot of pug matches and just trying to keep the game interesting.

Some people try speed runs, soloing or playing while keeping to lore. Thats fine, some people don't like to play with weak players and would prefer a team that can run through a platinum game in 20 minutes.

Personally i find the game gets too easy playing with a team thats too good. The game starts to become stale and more about getting equipment than the actual challenge and uniqueness of matches. Its almost a competition for points rather that just trying to survive. Playing with pugs reminds me more of how the game was meant to be and how it used to be when i first started playing. 

Thats why I LIKE playing pug matches. I even don't mind having to carry a team for a couple rounds because its a challenge and its just a part of the game for me. I understand that a lot of people don't play as much as i do and don't have the characters/equipment unlocked to play at the same level. But i don't kick those people from lobbies just for that, if they are honestly trying to play as a team and want to complete matches then i enjoy playing with them. Having to run for sketchy revives is part of the game and it keeps you on your toes. 

There is a limit of course, if you are playing a level one on gold/platinum of course i will kick you. If you are charging in, getting sync killed every round and just not being a team player then you will get kicked. But all in all i don't kick players for weak equipment, i like to give people a shot.

Regardless of the messages you send, the words you speak or the amount of kickvotes you can muster; this player will not use gear. His stacks of Cryo Ammo II, Shield Power Cell I and Pistol Amp III's are too valuable for use in your Collectors Condor Platinum run. He refuses to leave even with 15 minute lobby times, two kickvotes and constant debasement. Bonus points if he's the leader.

The ""Newbie""

They just don't know what's up. They don't. Their N7 level is 83 or their weapon setup is a ballin' Avenger X/Widow I combo. It scares you to imagine their build. They, and there is no exception to this rule, never wear a mic. Bonus points if for some reason they've created a Collectors Condor Platinum run (or at best forced out enough teams to end up with this setup).

The ""Coaster""

Rail Amp I or Headshot amp II. You realise they have a mic, but they will never speak, only rarely if ever offering a critique of your play as you double, triple, then quadruple their score. Bonus points if their last stand includes being surrounded by enemies and a call of ""I didn't want to waste my gels or missiles"" on the last target of a target elimination objective.

The Know Nothing ""Know it All""

""Are you sure you should be using a Reegar on a Salarian Infiltrator? I liked it on a Vorcha but I don't know if it's any good there...""

""Yeah, that guy is just outscoring me because he's an Infiltrator and he keeps using cloak to get the damage bonus.""

""I bet that guy cheesed his solo rounds for the Lone Wolf rank with a Krogan Vanguard,"" proceeds to play the Krogan Vanguard and rank under your score by almost a factor of 10. Ragequits on wave 6 on being sync killed after dozens of revives.
Bonus points if they were in a lobby you happened into with someone that lapped up their bullshit and actually turns out to be a decent person and player.

""The Blind Captain""

Horrifically under geared but queuing for Gold Collectors Condor. You question their choice of map, and likely their gear and weapons setup just to be met with casually confident retorts. You give it a go. They quit on round 2.

""The Inexplicable Retard""

A cool looking banner. A Harrier X. Optimal gear. Underscores you by a factor of 10. Bonus points if they're using a Turian Ghost and ruin each and every one of your biotic explosions before taking a Banshee arm to the chest.

""The Idiot Savant""

Their setup in the lobby is so questionable, you refuse to leave, if only to see what happens. The Black Widow IV and Grall Spike Thrower X with a Mental Focuser and Strength Enhancer I on a Human Soldier level 15 beggars belief. Ingame, on round one you're lagging behind them by 7000 points. This lead increases in multiples as each round is finished effortlessly. It's the easiest Collectors Condor Platinum run you ever did; sub-20 minutes and two survivor medals. Without a single word, as soon as you're back in the lobby they're gone. Bonus points if their N7 level is below 120. Bonus points if you have to go offline for a while to ponder on what actually happened.

The ""I don't yet realise the missile glitch was fixed do you mind if I do it in this lobby no it's not it's a glitch where you fire missiles every time fine but watch no it is a real thing seriously it is free money""

FUCK YOU GET OUT OF MY LOBBY

""The Constant Volus""

You recognise that name. Wasn't he playing the Volus Adept four or five rounds ago? Oh well, give him the benefit of the doubt. He can keep himself alive, but little else.

I am a N7 400+ player on XBL; not to brag, just to provide context.  I play Vanguard almost exclusively when running Gold with randoms and sometimes real friends/ME CoOP friends. I am also the creator of [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/rss6i/you_cant_go_charging_around_the_map_like_its_a/) awhile back which caught some attention. I have seen a lot of people having trouble with the class/race I love and have decided to write up a simple “How To” guide. There are a few things to know about Vanguards before you start:

* During Biotic Charge, you are invincible.

* During the Nova animation, you are invincible from the moment your feet leave the ground, until the Nova shockwave dissipates.

* If you are staggered by a melee, missile, or Banshee scream, you will not be able to Charge or Nova until a quarter second after the animation wears off.

* **HOST THE GAME!** Vanguards are notoriously susceptible to lag and of course, everyone’s favorite… [flying off the map](http://imgur.com/bWeEa). Hosting the game gets rid of all that. I have yet to have a problem since I’ve been hosting every match.

* If possible Nova before charging. You’ll regain your shields anyways, and if you choose Power Recharge as your 5th tier talent, you’ll have that active after you Charge.

* Holding back on your controller/keyboard after you Charge will take you out of melee strike distance so you will not get staggered before being able to drop a Nova, however sometimes the mobs will still melee at you, leaving them open for an attack.

* Get to as close to 200% recharge as you can, unless you are a Pewpew Laser Vanguard, you’ll never attack with weapons.

* Avoid bosses with instant KOs. Seriously. Banshee Magnet Arms are not to be trifled with. And Phantoms will give you the skewer even while they are in the middle of their stagger animation. It sucks.
Now to the classes: here are three types of Human Vanguard to play, Tank Vanguard, Biotic Murderspree Vanguard, and Pewpew Laser Vanguard.



**[Pewpew Laser Vanguard](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#50LAKNR)** &lt;-- This is link to build

* This Vanguard is not very good on Gold runs, but is quite fun to play on Silvers. Playing it is like playing an ME2 Vanguard; usually with some kind of shotgun or heavy pistol (the Talon is amazing here). The build revolves around dealing weapon damage in addition to all the biotic damage you’re dealing with Charge/Nova. Grabbing all the bonus weapon damage gives you huge ups and one Nova-Charge-Shotgun-Nova blast can take care of any non-boss in one blast. You’ll want to Nova first to get the recharge speed bonus, and then Charge to get the weapon damage bonus on top. By the time your shotgun goes off, you’ll be ready to charge again. I recommend the Talon, Disciple, or Geth Plasma Shotgun/Graal Spike Thrower (which allows full power usage while the gun is charged). Aim for the head.



**[Biotic Murderspree Vanguard](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#50MAKOR)** &lt;-- This is link to build

* This Vanguard is here to smash and deal massive damage as fast as possible. This class involves careful timings. If you Nova directly after charging, you’ll be sitting around waiting for the recharge. It helps to Nova first, and then Charge and wait a half second or so while enemies are still staggering to then Nova. By the time you land, you’ll have Charge off cooldown and be able smash into someone else. Alternatively you can Nova cancel by rolling directly after pressing Nova. This will make you invincible during the roll without dropping your shields, then just pop out of the roll and Nova. Your charge will be off cooldown when you are finished. If you noticed that I have chosen the Bonus Power as the 6th tier Biotic Charge talent. This is entirely up to you. Since you are going to be dropping a Nova after charging, having full shields when trying to deal as much damage as possible is kind of moot. Instead having the chance to immediately blast off another Charge can increase your damage output. I’ve gone back and forth with this but, in my humble opinion this is the better of the options if damage is your game. Feel free to increase your survivability if you like, these builds are just guidelines.



**[Tanking Vanguard](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#50RAQOR)** &lt;-- This is link to build

* This is the Vanguard I mostly play on Gold. It trades high damage output for threat control and exploitation of invincibility frames. Half Blast Nova and increased Radius is really your key for this build. The entire essence of this build is to attack as many groups of mobs as you can while setting off every tech burst and biotic explosion as possible. You do not have the power recharge bonus for this build, so feel free to charge immediately. **DO NOT DROP A NOVA WHILE CHARGING!** I do not know if this is a bug, but sometimes if you try to Nova during the Charge animation, you’ll come out of the Charge as if you have already Nova-d, and will only get one before your shields drop. Then you’ll be sitting waiting for a recharge, and will probably die. I know, it’s happened to me a lot. Be patient and calm with your Nova timings. After your second Nova, Charge will be off cool down. As described above, you’ll be invincible during both Nova animations, so it is easy to avoid death. Feel free to leave mobs you’ve been attacking to focus a new group of mobs on you instead of your team mates. Your team will finish off what you’ve been attacking while you help keep them safe from harm. Your role is not damage with this build, even though you’ll be doing a lot of it. Survival and threat control win Gold games.

1347127631.0,70,self.MECoOp,zkbl7,"What you didn't know about Overload:neural shock=double damage vs health, Shield damage evolution is useless, third bounce doesn't do damage.

",77,7,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/zkbl7/what_you_didnt_know_about_overloadneural/,"After a bunch of testing I finally think I get how this power works.


**1.With Neural shock evolution Overload does twice as much damage vs organics**


As you might know Overload has this multipliers


&gt;Overload (Base against organics) (Armor=50%, Barrier=300%, Shields=300%)
&gt;
Overload (Base against robots) (Armor=100%, Barrier=300%, Shields=300%)


It also does 50% damage vs organic health and 100% vs synthetic health.


__________________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________________

**Neural shock DOUBLES THE TOTAL DAMAGE  done vs organics. That is vs Health, Shields and Barriers.**
_____________________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________________________

This makes it an absolute must have,  its the difference from doing 1122 damage and 2244.
If you go for maximum single target damage you will be oneshotting the barriers of gold phantoms.
With consumables and gear even the barriers of a Platinum Phantom in one hit.

If you are worried that the neural shock effect will mess up their aim, note that enemies only fall on the ground if you hit them when they have health, the first hit that removes all their shields will not drop them on the ground.
Also only the main target falls, the second and third are just staggered.

_______________________________________


2. Shield damage evolution gives you 100% damage bonus vs shields. That is not as good as it sounds.
All it does is change the multiplier vs shields from 300% to 400%.
But if you chose the other evolution you get a 15% damage increase


**So with Shield damage you get 407x 4 =&amp;nbsp; 1628
With the other evolution you get&amp;nbsp; 440 x 3 = 1320**


You get a small damage increase (308) on your main target, but you lose 792 damage done to a secondary target and a stagger on that secondary target.


So unless you are doing a very specific widow/Javelin build and the shield damage gives you just enough to oneshot the shields, I advise you to avoid this Evolution.

_______________________________________

3. Bounces to secondary targets work in a very weird and buggy way. The way I thing it works is this.


**The secondary bounce does 60% damage of the full damage, but the third does 60% of the 60% of the secondary.**


So it should do 374 first, 224 second, 134 third.


When you cast overload I thing this happens:


If you are hitting health the game checks if you target is synthetic or organic and do you have the Neural shock evo, if it's organic and you have the neural shock perk it does not apply the damage penalty.
If it is synthetic it does not apply the damage penalty.


If you are hitting shields it applies the 300% or 400% damage multiplier.


**There is a chance that the game will fail the health check and it will do half damage to health, even if the target is Geth! It is a small chance on the main target.**


**However, on the second and third target it never does the check, so it always does half damage,even to geth.**


**So vs health is 374 first, 112 second, 67 third!**


**Vs shields the damage multiplier is applied on the first and second, but not the third.**


**So vs shields 1122 first, 673 second, 134 third!**



The damage of the third bounce is so low that it becomes irrelevant(it would take 158 his from the third bounce to drop the shields of an atlas on gold) The only thing it does is stagger.

_______________________________________

With this in mind I recommend to chose damage on evolution 1, neural shock on evo 2, and damage + bounce on evo 3.


With this on a human engineer you get vs heath&amp;nbsp; 440 first, 132 second, and vs shields 1320 first, 792 on secondary target.


I wish the tooltips were more clear, why would they not mention that neural shock gives you 100% bonus damage vs organic health.

Guys, I gotta say, Hackett’s  (possibly final) little missive for Lodestar has me kind of almost just a little bit choked up. Whether or not this is the final challenge for ME3 Coop, today it feels like it is.

As I read our mission flavor text this week, I had an inspiration tying the current state of the multiplayer mode to the end of the war in the singleplayer campaign. Maybe the Citadel DLC has me feeling a little extra nostalgic, but hear me out.

As the months have passed, we the players have gained not just loot, but also skill, and as we’ve done so we’ve moved to higher difficulties: to Silver, to Gold, to Platinum. The fighting grows fiercer; the enemy has become more diverse. As the battle raged, lesser kits have fallen – the once great Turian Sentinel now all but replaced by his more powerful cousin, the Ghost; the god-tier kit of the demo era, the Asari Adept, first challenged by the Fury and eventually toppled altogether by the Huntress. These are the actual casualties of the war.

Some of the old soldiers, the ones from the left side of the character select screen, still fight on, but for the most part all that remains is the true elite, a final ragged band of strange but effective warriors – Krogans wielding hammers, self-repairing sexbots, the odd Falcon-punching Volus (???), and the chittering Vorcha in their barbaric battle-diapers. And who cares now for the Mantis sniper rifle? Whence the mighty Carnifex? All gone. In these final days it’s all the Lancer IX or nothing.

Well, not for me, folks. Not every game, anyway.

…

Somewhere, in the flickering darkness of a forgotten medical wing, something stirs. A form rises, and pulls on a – what is that? – a blue on black leather tuxedo with pink tiger stripes and full frontal man-cleavage...it could only be a Drell! A Drell Adept, in fact. Once my go-to class for serious business, for whatever reason – maybe he has that lung disease thing, or maybe it was the three consecutive Banshee stomach impalements in that one match – my Drelldept has never even heard of a Reegar, much less used one. You said Volus have WHAT instead of a melee attack? And, most devastating of all…THEY PATCHED THE WUBWUB???

But check this out: I’ve got a Hurricane V, buddy! And this little thing here, this is called a Power Magnifier…

That’s right, guys. I can’t let this last challenge go by without bringing my old favorite class out for one more extraction. And maybe he hasn’t gotten tougher in all that time – no, he doesn’t compare to the EDIbot - but I’ve learned a few things (right hand advantage FTW!). This weekend, I’m going Platinum. And I’m taking the wubwub with me.

…

On a personal note, thanks all for making this board what it is. Your endless patience, erudition, and creativity have made this otherwise totally opaque and impenetrable game probably my most played of all time. For reasons I won’t get into, this has been the hardest, most hopeless, most difficult year of my life – and when nothing else, no book, no movie, no other game, would hold my interest, I’ve kept on playing ME3 coop, often just to see what the hell your new weirdo Human Adept Melee build, or whatever, looks like in practice. Thanks.

So enough of that. ‘It’s been a hard, road, but…’ Join me! What build are you bringing back in these last weeks? Got an old dog you want to mod new tricks into?

*Whether you want to improve your skills, or you are in it for the challenge, or if you just want something to brag about in the boasting thread, soloing is a great way to do it.* 

*One big problem with learning how to solo is that when you watch videos of other players, whatever they are doing usually looks easy and like you just have to copy their build and do the same thing.* 

*For most of you, that probably leads to you getting horribly murdered.* 

*The goal of this guide is to explain why that is, and what you have to do differently.* 

*Because I can't simply explain everything, here are two posts with information that you should know before reading this guide.* 

* [Interwebninja's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16zcwq/me_coop_college_501_making_the_jump_to_gold/) on how to transition to gold.
* [RepShred's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16weze/me_coop_college_maps_301_overview/) on maps

*If you need visual examples of what I'm talking about, I link to specific parts of videos several times, but if you just want some general solo videos you can check [my youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/cledioify?feature=mhee).*

*Also note that if you are not a comfortable gold (team) player, even bronze will be very hard to solo.*

**Settings**
--

There are a couple of things that you can do to help yourself out. Sadly these only apply to pc users.

* **Field of view**

I highly recommend [increasing your fov.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/14b1ek/guide_how_to_change_your_fov_pc_only_sorry/) I use 100. It helps a lot lot to be a little more aware of what's to your side.

Also if you are sitting close to a big monitor, the standard fov is way too small and that can really mess with your brain. (Some people can get nauseous or dizzy from this). 

* **De-tangling the omni-button**

social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/11603699/

This is more important in team games than in solos (because of reviving), but it's still nice to have.

I have to admit though that I personally haven't changed anything because I'm really lazy and don't want to learn new buttons. 

* **Controls**

I don't know anything about how to set up a controller (or if it is even possible to remap), so I'm just talking about pc again. Maybe someone else could post some console specific tips down below.  

Remapping your keys is obviously relevant for team games as well, but in solos it can be an even bigger deal.   
If you need a thermal pack, you want that ammo right fucking now, not after three seconds of fumbling for the right button.

The most important thing is that you can reach all your buttons comfortably and comfortable can be very different for different people, so I'm just going to say how I've set it up, and maybe that will give some people ideas. 

I leave the powers on 1; 2 and 3. I have ops-packs on Q, missile launcher on E. Medi-gel is on mouse wheel turned up (for reload-canceling). Melee is mouse-wheel pressed down. 

My thermal packs are on 4.

If you have any extra mouse buttons, you can also use those. 

---

**Gameplay**
---

*Now let's get to the actual fun part. [Part 3 of interwebninja's guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16zcwq/me_coop_college_501_making_the_jump_to_gold/c80rwp3) covers this very well so check that out first. But there are some things I want to expand on. (And some I want to reiterate for importance.)*

* **Right hand advantage**

Interwebninja explains this quite well, I just want to mention how incredibly important this is. Often times, especially when fighting enemies like atlases or primes, this is the only way to do damage to them without getting hammered yourself. 

* **Dodging**

Well, this is kind of obvious. If you are soloing, you are host, that means you can dodge almost everything if you react quick enough. 

The most notable ones are rocket-trooper missiles and banshee warp thingies. Both come with a warning sound and move slow enough to not require super human reflexes.

Dodge them either by doing your dodge (...) or by entering hard cover. Against banshee balls, you will often not take damage while in hard cover, [even if it looks like you got hit.](http://youtu.be/Iw_pANXsPkU?t=13m45s) 

It takes some practice of course, but I personally feel that if I get hit by one of these, I made an avoidable mistake. 

* **Movement**

Most enemies have pretty terrible aim against moving targets. So if you can't be in soft cover using right hand advantage, being on the move is the next best thing. 

Never run straight away or straight towards enemies though, they can and will hit you if you do. Always move diagonally. 

Don't stand still in the open, you will die. 

* **Kiting**

Most people probably know what this means, but for those who don't: Against melee(ish) enemies (brutes, banshees, pyros, abominations, praetorians, dragoons) you want to always move backwards while shooting, so you stay out of range of their close range attacks.

This way you can kill them without ever giving them the chance to touch you. 

It's important to remain aware of what is behind you while you are doing that. 

* **Strafing**

Strafing while shooting is almost always a good idea, unless you are already in a good soft cover position.

As long as you are moving sideways, enemies will have a much harder time hitting you, and some enemies (scions) will just become plain incapable of hurting you. 

* **Which enemies to kill first**

One of the more important decisions you have to constantly make is which targets to focus your fire on.

The big bosses are usually best left for last. The reason being that the bosses are worth relatively little in wave points. All of the big stuff is worth 100 points (praetorians are 120), basic troopers are 20 to 25 and the mid level stuff is 40 to 70.

I don't know about you, but I'd much rather kill three abominations than a praetorian. 

It's best to kill the things first that are a) easy to kill; b) an immediate threat and c) worth a (relatively) large amount of wave points. 

Thing that are a first rate target in my opinion are hunters, dragoons, guardians, ravagers and abominations. On some classes phantoms, brutes, scions are also good targets. 

Marauders, hunters, centurions, captains as well as the basic troopers are always decent targets, but in my opinion they are harder to kill in relation to their points than some of the above. They are also not as dangerous as most of them. 

---

**Awareness**
--

*Awareness is the single most important thing in a solo. The most common death reason in solos is something sneaking up behind you, or you running away only to have your escape route blocked by an enemy.* 

*You have to do everything in your power to avoid getting surrounded, and here are some ways you can make sure it doesn't happen.* 

* **Counting enemies**

There are always eight enemies on the map. So, if you see 8 enemies, you know that nothing is behind you. 

If you want to solo anything involving cerberus, I would also recommend memorizing [how many phantoms there are on each wave.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgoNSTctMEekdEJZUFQ0R1pid0JsY25QRUZrbE50QlE&amp;output=html&amp;gid=3) It's extremely helpful to know whether all of them are accounted for, or if there might be one sneaking up behind you. 

Same goes for hunters if you are playing geth. 

* **Spawns**

Always memorize all the spawn points on a map. We have college posts for the different maps too and all spawn locations should be mentioned in those (hopefully).

At the beginning of a wave you want to block spawns, so that enemies spawn in desirable positions. Most maps have 5 to 7 spawns, which means if you block two and are in vision of one, you only need to check one or two more spawns to know where the enemies are. 

Keep in mind that this is just personal preference and comfort. It isn't really important which spawns you block, but I think it's good to block the same ones every wave, so you game gets more consistent. 

Also you don't want enemies to spawn on both sides of you, so blocking spawns in the middle of the map isn't the smartest thing. 

In the middle of the wave, don't forget that any enemy you kill will immediately respawn elsewhere. 

It can be hard to keep track of, but most of the time you are in vision or blocking three or more spawns, which means you should at least know the direction the respawned enemies are going to come from. Maneuver yourself so that you don't get sandwiched. 

Sadly on platinum this kind of goes out of the window again, because [platinum spawns are retarded.](http://youtu.be/dszdBo08R2g?t=23m16s) 

* **Listening**

Most enemies make distinct sounds. In solos this is much easier to make use of because there aren't three teammates running around doing their thing. 

I recommend using headphones for this reason, they make it much easier to tell which direction sound is coming from. 

* **Looking**

I try to look to the side everytime I reload. Additionally I usually try to do a 360 look whenever I switch cover.

Most of the time I do know where all enemies are (or at least where they are supposed to be) from observing spawns, but being safe never hurts, and enemies sometimes do stupid shit.

1351261610.0,68,self.MECoOp,124hk8,Fucking Aimbot Wallhacker: my geth infiltrator build,73,5,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/124hk8/fucking_aimbot_wallhacker_my_geth_infiltrator/,"Gather round children, as I tell you one of the ancient legends from long, long ago, back when Mass Effect 3 was a new game and people still cared about single-player and the ending. See, back in these days long past, people still actually played infiltrators, the sniping class, with sniper rifles.

""Sniper rifles?"" you say. ""But in all my years I've only ever seen infiltrators use shotguns or a cerberus harrier!""

And that's a damn good point. You see, for a while no sniper rifle was good enough to match the potential of these other guns. This all resulted from a dark, dark time in the history of Mass Effect multiplayer, a time we now refer to as the Great Infiltrator Cataclysm of the Post-Krysae Era.

""Krysae?"" you say. ""Now you're just making up words. I ain't never heard of no krysae!""

And there's a reason for that son. Not too long after the game was released, the gods bestowed a new sniper rifle upon us, one sniper rifle to rule them all, the krysae. It flooded into every loadout, and soon infiltrators around the world had turned to the dark side, seeing no reason to use any other weapon. And it was true. There legitmately was no reason to use any other gun. The krysae could do it better, with less effort, and with an area of effect. I myself contributed to the catastrophe that would soon befall us. For the gods became angry. And in their Divine Retribution, they said, ""Your misuse of the krysae brings with it a terrible price! From now on, **ALL** sniper rifles will be a shadow of their former selves!""

And in this great cataclysm, all other sniping builds that had previously existed were washed away along with the krysae plague, and the new era of assault rifles and shotguns began.

Noblest among all the sniper rifle casualties was the Black Widow. Before the Sundering, this weapon was truly a sight to behold and a force to be reckoned with. Afterwards it was a shadow of its former self, and my geth infiltrator platform, designation 1337n0sc0p3z420, was forced to abandon its proud heritage of marksmanship and begin using a pedestrian cerberus assault rifle.

**But rejoice I say to ye! For the Return is at hand! The gods have accepted our penance and the sanctity of true sniper rifles is slowly being restored! First among them to make the Return, and rightfully so, is none other than the legendary Black Widow, and it makes its return even stronger than it was in the days of myth!**

So now that story time's over, let's talk about my geth infiltrator. This is a build I've been running almost since the class was first released, and although it had to be retired after the nerf, it's back at full force and has most definitely stood the test of time. In my opinion, this is the absolute premier sniping build in the game right now. [**CHECK IT.**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#43RIMLDd7%400DE%40%40c4R4%400%400)

Some things to go over:

**What makes the black widow so good on this class?**

The rate of fire bonus from hunter mode allows you to get all three shots off with cloak bonus. This class's lack of a shield-stripping ability means that it's going to be markedly less effective against elite units with a single-shot rifle (unless, apparently, you can make javelin headshots on fast-moving targets 100% of the time, which I mean hey, best of luck to anyone who wants to try that). With the black widow, however, everything that isn't a boss dies in 2 shots or less. Let's give it a brief rundown:

*1 bodyshot/1 uncloaked headshot:* assault troopers, geth troopers, cannibals

*1 headshot/2 bodyshots:* rocket troopers, nemeses

*1 headshot/3 bodyshots:* dragoons, guardians

*2 bodyshots:* centurions, geth hunters, collector captains, marauders, combat engineers (shield-stripping may require a headshot or two bodyshots with lower-level black widows against hunters and marauders, that's how it was pre-nerf with my BW IV)

*geth pyros:* 2 headshots, 2 bodyshots then a headshot, or a headshot then 2 bodyshots. Your choice. They are slow as fuck so I recommend just getting headshots to go towards your nice end-of-round gold medal.

*phantoms:* headshot then a bodyshot or 3 bodyshots. Don't shoot them during a ninja flip. Hitting them with a prox mine will make them stand nice and still for you to line up a shot at their head.

As you can see, one of the things that makes this class so good is its ability to kill pretty much every non-boss enemy in the game in a single cloak cycle with ease. After the buffs to the BW, I've found that brutes and ravagers are added to the list as well. Make sure to hit them with a prox mine to get the damage bonus. Ravagers go down in 2 shots if you hit their sac with one, and brutes go down in 3 as long as one's a headshot. Once again, with a lower level BW, your results may vary.

**Sniper rifles are awkward at close range/I have a question about why you picked the (x) evolution on (x) skill:**

Both of these can probably be explained by the same thing. I am very aware of the popular melee build for geth infiltrator, and have seen its effectiveness firsthand many times. I love sniping on the class too much to ever compromise the class's sniping potential, but have found a way to fit a lite version of the melee build into my own to give you a close-range option/panic button. The damage afforded by the prox mine boost, the cloak melee upgrade, and 3 in fitness gives you enough damage to kill weaker enemies in a prox mine and 1 or two pulses. The reason I took power damage instead of headshot damage in the class passive is to give your prox mine enough damage to kill husks without bothering to melee. Here's another list for you of what enemies can be easily killed by your melee:

*prox mine*: husks

*prox mine, 1 pulse:* cannibals, geth troopers, assault troopers, collector troopers, seeker swarms

*prox mine, 2 pulses:* rocket troopers, nemeses, centurions, combat engineers, marauders, collector captains

Anything stronger should be dealt with with your black widow, and frankly, should never get within melee range of you in the first place. Geth hunters and pyros are quite easy to line up close-range shots on though due to their slow move speed. If you see a phantom at close range, do not attempt to melee her unless her barriers are low. If they are, she'll go down in two pulses. If she's at full, run. You can also grab cover, pop off a bodyshot, wait for cooldown, cloak, then run up, prox mine, and melee to kill.

**WTF WALLHAX, PLZ BAN:**

What I imagine geth pyros say after I headshot them twice through a wall as our hero 1337n0sc0p3z420 responds with, ""cry moar, w+m1 scrub."" See when you think about it, armed combat to the geth is basically a video game. They control weapons platforms and respawn in a server hub after they ""die."" Anyways, this amazing new feature of the black widow comes from the addition of the illustrious new sniper mod, the high velocity barrel. Using both this and the old piercing mod on your black widow gives it javelin-like piercing ability. Combined with your hunter mode, most walls pose little to no obstruction to your ability to kill. In fact, the piercing damage reduction doesn't even seem to be enough to keep most of the shot combinations I listed above from killing. I like to go for headshots when shooting through walls just to be sure though. If your BW is at low level, the low spare ammo count may require you to hit up ammo boxes fairly frequently. At high level though, I don't think the spare ammo mod is necessary at all. My BW VIII has 25 shots. Although the gun does have some inherent cover penetration, it's barely enough to pierce the thinnest cover. Back when I used extended barrel and spare ammo, a lot of the times my shots wouldn't even go through parts of those extremely thin little chest-high walls like you see on parts of FBW and Giant. With 2 piercing mods on it though, you won't believe how much cover your shots can go through. It's insane. The floor of Dagger, the sandstone walls of Giant, even a lot of the thick boxes littered around a lot of the maps. Try it out, you'll be surprised at just how powerful this gun's piercing capabilities are with the right equipment.

In summation, I think this is pretty much *the* build for geth infiltrator. Deadly from any range, whether point-blank or across the map, insane damage, ability to kill all non-boss enemies in a single cloak cycle. If you like sniping, look no further than this guy. Some prefer shotguns or assault rifles, but don't feel like those are the only options if you want to make a return to the roots of the infiltrator class.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,PC,True,t3_124hk8,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/124hk8/fucking_aimbot_wallhacker_my_geth_infiltrator/,

---------------------------------------
**Event Description:**

Our successes on Earth have given us the capability to land materiel in several war zones. However, in order to conceal shipments to the resistance, each delivery needs corresponding strikes on Reaper targets to create a screening distraction. The operations to deliberately gain Reaper attention are extremely high-risk and will require increased numbers to spread thin Reaper reaction forces. For this mission, N7 commanders, wherever possible, will recruit and command supplemental volunteer units: recent graduates of our N7 program and soldiers who bring experience from other branches.

**Challenge Goal 1:** Extract once on each Earth map (London, Vancouver, and Rio).

**Challenge Goal 2:** Score 100,000 cumulative points against Reaper enemies.

Challenges can be completed at any difficulty.

Completion of both goals awards the player a Commendation Pack.

**Completion of both goals also awards the player a banner, “Hero of the Last Days.”**

They are the Hornet (Assault Trooper), Mattock (Centurion), Phalanx (Engineer), Talon (Guardian), Phaeston (Marauder), Geth Pulse Rifle (Geth Trooper), and Geth Plasma Shotgun (Geth Hunter). I omitted the Raptor (Nemesis) because she uses it with the special ""Assassination"" ability, which makes a direct comparison difficult.

I averaged out the damage per shot delta (change) from a Level I to Level X weapon, then extrapolated that out to match the posted damage per shot of each enemy version of the weapon.

**M-25 Hornet**

* Silver - Level XVI (26)
* Gold - Level XLIII (43)
* Platinum - Level LVI (56)

**M-96 Mattock**

* Silver - Level XXI (21)
* Gold - Level XXXVI (36)
* Platinum - Level XLVIII (48)

**M-5 Phalanx**

* Bronze - Level XLIII (43)
* Silver - Level LXXIII (73)
* Gold - Level CII (102)
* Platinum - Level CXXV (125)

**M-358 Talon**

* Bronze - Level LXXXIX (89)
* Silver - Level CXXXVIII (138)
* Gold - Level CLXXXIII (183)
* Platinum - Level CCXX (220)

**Phaeston**

* Silver - Level XX (20)
* Gold - Level XXXII (32)
* Platinum - Level XLIV (44)

**Geth Pulse Rifle**

* Bronze - Level LI (51)
* Silver - Level LXXXVI (86)
* Gold - Level CXVII (117)
* Platinum - Level CXLIV (144)

**Geth Plasma Shotgun**

* Gold - Level XII (12)
* Platinum - Level XX (20)

So, next time you're wondering why Cerberus Troops use the Hornet, it's because their version is 16-46 levels more powerful than yours. Also, why the Geth are so effective; their Pulse Rifles are 41-134 levels more powerful than ours too.

I wanted to see if anyone was interested in having an event calendar for Reddit meetups in game.  We could play with each other, teach the new guys, and experiment in an environment without being harassed by other people, and set up gold farming groups for those that want it.

So, if you'd rather play with your fellow Redditors instead of random pubs, I'd be happy to set something up.  Just sign with your XBL/PS3/PC gamertag, and platform of choice.

EDIT: Alright!  I'm glad to see everyone is so pumped for the idea! As SpiceAddict touched on, there are no in-game tools for this, so our organization is going to be Reddit-centralized.  What I'm thinking right now is:

Weekend Group Games: We have weekly sign in sheet, similar to our Weekly Rant Thread, with people that want to participate signing in and confirming their ability to play for that Saturday/Sunday (obviously, if you cancel out, that's no big deal.  Internet web forums are hardly a set-in-stone social commitment, but try to make sure you can play a few games if you sign up), and we can assign some groups of four.  I would love to see everyone add each other, so that each Redditor has a ""master list"" of players, and when the groups come up, they can invite those players.

My idea behind setting up specific groups before hand is so that if some players want to do crazy things (in the IRC, there was talk of a party of four Geth infiltrator melee builds), they can do that, otherwise we could put together some balanced builds and let Redditors meet people they may otherwise have not chatted with.

For Example:

Group 1 - Fochmarc (Quarian Infiltrator), Viskus (Salarian Engineer), capricaswiss (Asari Justicar), ShamelessKarmaW (Drell Adept)

Obviously that's just an example (I don't even know if Shameless has a Drell [SHAMELESS GET A DRELL]), but it would provide decoys, headshots, crowd control, and biotic explosions, and it ensures a nice smooth run.

1357873518.0,63,self.MECoOp,16cugx,ME3 Co-Op College- Races 101: The Base Human Kits,70,7,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16cugx/me3_coop_college_races_101_the_base_human_kits/,"Because of Operation Genesis requiring the use of the basic Human Kits, I figure I return to my roots of rooting for the base Humans. If you could not discern it from my flair, I love the base Human kits because of their versatility and availability. Even with access to powerful alien and N7 kits, the base Humans are still competitive and not to be underestimated. So here is a quick and mostly comprehensive guide to getting the most out of your base Human kits.

From my experience, there are two kinds of base Human players. The first kind of players are the newbies who just got the game and don't have anything else. These people are awesome and you should nurture them to be better players. We can always use some better players. The second kind are the master players, because they realize how amazing the base kits are and shame 80% of the other kits in their raw awesomeness and power.

**Racial Passives and Traits**

Alliance Training and Fitness are the passives every base Human kit shares. They are quite balanced for racial passives and tend not to emphasize one aspect over another. I recommend putting points in Fitness for defenses over melee as I do not see Humans having enough melee or raw health to be a meleeing sort of race. 500/500 Health/Shields is not that much and it goes down quickly at close range.

Humans do possess the ability to do a combat roll, both in and out of cover. In my opinion the combat roll is the best dodge in the game as it can be easily spammed in multiple directions, it does not send you flying far (looking at you jetpack Turians), and the animation is quick. Once you master the combat roll, the Human gain a lot more survivability.

**Human Adept**

First off the list is one of the rarer kits you will see on the interwebs. The Human Adept (HA) is mainly a Biotic power user and has three solid powers to choose from. These powers are *Singularity, Shockwave, and Warp*. These powers can be easily strung together and cause many Biotic Explosions (BEs) by themselves and with other teammates.

* The first one is Singularity, which is an AoE BE primer on all targets on all defenses. It also does a damage effect on anything caught within the Singularity. The AoE effect of priming pairs well with Shockwave as this combo can cause multiple BEs per cast. Targets down to pure Health get lifted into the field, rendering them unable to do anything except cry at the impending BE they are going to receive.

* The second power is Shockwave, an excellent power for any kit. With the highest detonating BE modifier (65% at Rank 5), strong force (can easily break 1000N), the ability to hit two targets per cast, and the ability to go through walls, Shockwave is a hard hitting biotic power that can slam through enemies and is almost always a useful power. Keep in mind that Shockwave may bother other squadmates who wish to aim their guns and it has a limited range.

* And finally we have Warp. Warp is known to be a solid power to have for BEs, and debuffing (with a small DoT effect too), so I recommend that you always take Warp on any HA. Warp and Shockwave can yield a particularly nasty BE and doing so is a highly recommended tactic.

[Look on BBLoB for HA builds](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/145i1k/bblob_adept_characters/) and pick your favorite. There's some variety to choose from, but BEs are the cornerstone for any good HA.

**Human Soldier**

Of all the base Human kits, this seems to be the most popular. Why? Because the Human Soldier (HSol) is a beast with weapons. Alliance Training is a decent weapons racial passive and with Adrenaline Rush, mods and equipment, the HSol can deal ~260% of the base weapon damage. *Adrenaline Rush, Concussive Shot, and Frag Grenades* all mix very well with both weapons and Tech teams, which are common focuses in PUG MP squads.

* Adrenaline Rush allows for an instant reload of a weapon and ramps up weapon damage. It can also allow for tanking with the proper Rank 4 and 6 evolutions. That versatility rivals that of Tactical Cloak and is rarely skipped. It also makes guns with low damage/bullet like the Revenant and Claymore hit like a train.

* Concussive Shot (CS) tends to be dropped from a lot of players minds when they build a HSol, but it has two key attributes. The first is that it is the fastest, reliable, single detonator of Tech Explosions, which allows it to pair well with a [designated primer](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1388bf/it_takes_two_to_tango_human_ingenuity/). The second is that CS can get past the 500N threshold for Platinum minions. This means that a CSs will either stagger a minion or force it to dodge, allowing for easy headshots. Finally CS has 4x damage multiplier vs Barriers, which is incredibly useful against Collectors, Banshees, and Phantoms.

* Last but not least, Frag Grenades. They hit hard and with a wide AoE as well. Solid grenade and I recommend at least putting 3 ranks into it for emergencies.

It's easy to observe the supremacy of the HSol by seeing how many [builds exist](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/145jcw/bblob_soldier_characters/) for it.

**Human Engineer**

Like the HSol, the Human Engineer (HE) is another solid kit that you will see from time to time in a PUG. Why? Because the HE has three solid Tech powers (*Incinerate, Overload, Combat Drone)* that can be strung together to make [many Fire Explosions (FEs) and Tech Bursts (TBs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1388bf/it_takes_two_to_tango_human_ingenuity/), much like how the HAs can string their powers for BEs. 

* The first power is Combat Drone. While it may seem weak at first, it serves its purpose as a mobile distraction and combat buddy. You can spec the drone to either be a floating time bomb, personal best friend, or something in between. It can qualify as the second best player in the game, after you of course.

* Now to Overload. This hitscan electrical power has a damage multiplier against Shields/Barriers and a damage penalty against organic Health. This penalty can be removed by taking the Rank 5 Neural Shock evolution. Overload can also be evolved to chain jump to another target, which can also detonate multiple Tech Explosions. Overload can also prime for TBs and is a solid power on any kit.

* The HE also has the inverse of Overload in the form of Incinerate. Effective against Armor and organic Health (by causing panic), Incinerate can detonate Tech Explosions and prime for FEs. Incinerate deals DoT as well, making it an excellent way to finish off an opponent. It's another solid power on any kit like Overload.

There are [several variations](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/146di5/bblob_engineer_characters/) to choose from and all of them can support a team in their own way.

**Human Sentinel**

The Human Sentinel (HSent) is basically an honorary Biotic with a bit of tanking ability. *Tech Armor, Warp, and Throw* are all solid powers and there is rarely a reason to skip out on any of them.

* Tech Armor is an activated power that generates holographic armor around the user and can be detonated. When turned on, the user gets damage reduction, power cooldown penalty, and a stat boost at Rank 5. When used while active, Tech Armor detonates to get rid of the bonuses and deals damage (and a strong force) over a small radius around the user. 

* As stated in the HA, Warp is an excellent debuffer and primer for BEs. It complements both a BE-focused HSent with powerful BE capabilities and a weapon-focused HSent with its debuffing power. Never neglect Warp on a HSent.

* Throw is another solid Biotic power. It can detonate any Power Combo, making it useful on any team that uses powers for damage. With a fast cooldown and projectile speed, Throw hits its targets accurately and quickly. It even has a strong base force behind it, further increasing its usefulness on any enemy.

[Like the Human Engineer](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/146l59/bblob_sentinel_characters/), there is a solid variety of HSent builds to fit your tastes ranging from heavy power to heavy weapons.

**Human Infiltrator**

Like the HA, the Human Infiltrator (HI) is a rare find when seen in a PUG. Like many Infiltrators, the HI benefits the most from a strong gun and powers to supplement. The three powers are useful (*Tactical Cloak, Cryo Blast, Sticky Grenades*), but compared to other Infiltrators they appear lackluster. Combined however, these powers allow for massive burst damage.

* The first power is Tactical Cloak (TC), where the HI can turn invisible and gains a damage bonus when attacking in cloak. Every Infiltrator has this power, so if you have played any other Infiltrator it's nearly the same power. There are two notes about TC that everyone should know. 

~~The first is that attacking in TC will break the cloak 1 second after the attack is made, while the damage bonus will persist 2.5 seconds after the cloak is broken.~~ (IPTF corrects me on this).  The cloak ends 1 second after an offensive action and the bonus persists for 1.5 seconds after that. 2.5 seconds in total. Infiltrators can therefore spend 2.5 out of every 4 seconds with the cloak bonus. 

 The second is that in order to get true invisibility to the enemy, TC must be activated outside of the enemy LoS. This means activating TC behind a wall or in a corner of the map where no enemy is present. If the enemy sees you enter TC, they will spray where you were and might plan to be. This gives the illusion that TC doesn't make you stealthy when that occurs.

* The next power is Cryo Blast. An excellent debuffer against armor and movement slower by default, Cryo Blast can be upgraded to deal multiplicative damage debuff with the Rank 5 and 6 evolutions. If you are going for a shotgun HI, I highly recommend bringing Cryo Blast to make the shotgun blow right through the enemy.

* Finally, we have Sticky Grenades. A very powerful grenade that has a small radius. It even has evolutions to act as a proximity mine (Rank 6) and Armor annihilator (Rank 5). Even if it's only the first 3 ranks, never skip out on the awesome power of Sticky Grenades.

Since I consider myself a master of [HI builds](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/146ls3/bblob_infiltrator_characters/), I recommend the Cryo Claymore Commando over the Classic Infiltrator unless you are a solid sniper. The Cryo Claymore Commando can abuse both TC and Cryo Blast to give an abusive burst damage output along with Sticky Grenades that can melt Armor.

**Human Vanguard**

I'll be honest and say that I flat out suck with the Human Vanguard (HV) (or any Vanguard really) compared to the rest of the Human kits. I blame it on the fact that I don't enjoy using *Biotic Charge and Nova* and those don't mix well with the third power *Shockwave* at all. If you want a more in depth look at the HV, I recommend starting [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/s09sa/how_to_human_vanguard/) or [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/10m7xn/guide_human_vanguard_novaguard/).

* So most Human Vanguards revolve around Novaguarding, where a player uses Biotic Charge to fill up Barriers and use Nova to drain Barriers for damage, then repeat the process until either the HV or the enemy is dead. Biotic Charge and Nova have such good synergy that it's hard to not play the HV as such. To assist in that, Nova tends to be set at Half Blast (Rank 5) so that there can be two Novas in between Biotic Charges, which can restore 100% shields upon use (Rank 6).

* There is a useful technique called Nova-cancelling, where you cancel the attack on Nova with a roll dodge to maintain invincibility while dodging. This technique is the one technique that separates amazing Novaguards from Novaguards like me.

[Check out BBLoB for HV builds](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/146qdz/bblob_vanguard_characters/), but I cannot comment on any of them because HV is my worst kit in the entire game. He is a solid asset to any Biotic team due to his rapid detonation ability.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully that gives you the basic rundown on the base Human kits. The great thing about the base Humans is that they are available to everyone and they scale fairly well with weapon development. As a player gets better and better weapons, the base Human kits get better and better as well. Even with URs at X, the base Human kits are a force to be reckoned with.

And if you think the aliens are better, then remember this. ""When you need a problem shot, ask a Turian. When you need a problem talked to﻿ death, ask an Asari.

**Introduction**

So you want to take on Platinum? A noble goal indeed. Conquering the hardest difficulty available is quite an accomplishment and I am here to help. This guide does not guarantee perfect play and guaranteed extractions, but it should prepare you for the trials and tribulations that will occur on Platinum.

So this guide is going to be divided into three parts. The first part is *Pregame Knowledge*, where I will discuss everything that you need to prepare for before you hit the lobby. This includes mental preparation, inventory checks, build checks, and a bit of social interaction. The second part is *Lobby Knowledge*, where I will discuss everything that you can change in the lobby, including enemy and map compositions, kit considerations with regards to others, and Power Combos. The final part is *Ingame Knowledge*, which will cover anything that you can change while actually playing a Platinum game. All three sections will follow the path of two builds, which have video evidence to back them up. To prevent confusion, the [Vorcha Sentinel will be abbreviated as VS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWPtCpLluqE) and the [Base Human Sentinel will be abbreviated as BHS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3Mix8kv_bY). If you happen to see VS and BHS, it refers to those two specific kits and their respective videos. I am doing this to help outline my thought process on the matter.

Before you read this post, I highly recommend reading InterwebNinja's [Transition to Gold](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16zcwq/me_coop_college_501_making_the_jump_to_gold/) post and mrcle123's [Guide to Solo-ing](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/17chzb/me_coop_college_503_how_to_solo/). In particular, many aspects of Gold translate straight into Platinum so I expect you to have already read that post to get the best experience.

___________________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________

**Pregame Knowledge**

So first off, why do you want to do Platinum? If all you want is the credits, allow me to explain Glacier farming. Long story short, 4 players can block spawns so that all the enemies spawn in Glacier's basement. Nuke spawns with missiles except for objective waves. Repeat every 10 minutes until you have [LOADSAMONEY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON-7v4qnHP8). Now you know how to play Platinum for credits. Google it if you have any more questions.

Now if you want to play Platinum for fun and for a challenge, continue reading. The joy of surviving such an onslaught of bosses and enemies is rarely rivaled and each victory should be celebrated. Extra credits aren't that bad, but given the necessary consumables to play on Platinum it may be more expensive than you think. 

Anyways, what are some signs that you should give Platinum a go?


* *Desire for challenge*- As stated beforehand, if you want a challenge Platinum will give you it. With enemies that have ~30% more health and with bosses on every wave, Platinum isn't a walk in the park.

* *Maxed out Rares/have access to all URs*- Now I don't expect you to have every Rare at X nor access to every UR, but I do expect the Rares (weapons and mods) that you will use to be at X and the URs to be at a decent level (say III+). Good weapons are the cornerstone of a good build, considering this game is a third-person *shooter*. Make sure to bring your best weapons available.

* *Spare high level equipment*- It's the hardest difficulty, so don't skimp on the consumables. You better have a darn good reason not to equip each slot with a level III/IV consumable, like if you have someone looking over your shoulder that will stab you if you equip a level III Assault Rifle Rail Amp. You will notice in both videos that I don't skimp on equipment, though my massive surplus helps with that. Consider spending money on Spectre Packs to boost your high level equipment stores.

* *Clearing Gold with relative ease*- Related to the first point, you should be able to clear Gold PUGs with ease if you want to contribute on Platinum. The only thing worse than having a sagging teammate on Gold is having that same sagging teammate on Platinum. If you can carry Gold PUGs with low amounts of frustration, then Platinum is the next logical step. 

* *Solid, dependable teammates*- This may or may not happen with PUGs, but from my experience (PC) Platinum PUGs are usually dependable and you can tell who you can count on based on the equipment they bring. I personally recommend bringing at least one friend if possible, as having a dependable teammate halves the difficulty of Platinum thanks to how different kits can interact (more on that later).

______________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Builds**

Now for builds. How you spec out a kit can drastically change the effectiveness of said kit. So like many games, kits can fall under the rule of threes. In this game, this can be defined by the MMO holy trinity of *Tanking*, *DPS*, and *Support*. Granted, there is some overlap (e.g.- DPS can overshadow the need to Tank and Support can enhance DPS) but each aspect can fall under those three categories. *Special Tricks* for each kit can round out these three aspects.


* *Tanking*- This revolves around how well can you resist damage. Things that help include speed, high shields/health, damage reducing powers like Tech Armor and Fortification. regenerative powers like Shield Boost and Bloodlust, and the ability to evade damage such as dodging and dropping aggro (Tactical Cloak and [pets](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/182ehk/mecoop_college_609_powers_drones_and_turrets_and/)).One aspect of tanking that isn't mentioned too often is stagger resistance. Pre-Retaliation Batarians and Krogans as well as the N7 Destroyer (especially with Devastator Mode) and Geth Juggernaut have heightened stagger resistance, making them perfect for tasks that require them to stay out in enemy fire such as ramp-up weapons and close range combat with tough minions like Dragoons and Hunters. Overall, tanking is the one aspect most easily supplemented by smart gameplay such as the [Right Hand Advantage](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19lh02/mecoop_college_tips_and_tricks_505_right_hand/), flanking, and hugging cover. 

In the case of the VS, Bloodlust combined with a decent health pool and a fast dodge ensure he can resist most attacks. You will notice me in the video dodging to avoid sync kills and using cover to keep regenerating my health so I avoid going down. Killing off small enemies also boosts Bloodlust's regen speed, so I try my best to constantly kill enemies to keep that rapid regeneration up.

In the case of the BHS, high shields thanks to a Cyclonic Modulator IV along with damage reduction from Tech Armor and the base Human dodge means he could deflect most minor attacks so he could continue launching Biotic attacks. You will notice me hugging cover to minimize my exposure so that my shields can regenerate.

* *DPS*- The meat of Platinum gameplay is slaying bad guys before than can hurt you. Some kits have extreme power damage (like the [Geth Trooper](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/GethTrooper/LKHIF/Acolyte10BP5BK5//PistolRailAmp3/PowerAmplifierModule4/OmniCapacitors5/) and others can combo their way to victory (like an [N7 Paladin](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Sentinel/NPaladin/GKQDR/Hurricane10AV5BC5//SMGRailAmp3/PowerAmplifierModule4/OmniCapacitors5/)), but for most kits a healthy portion of DPS will come from weaponry. This is the main reason why having an expansive weapon's arsenal is important. For some kits (Infiltrators and some Soldiers in particular), weapons are the core of a kit. Infiltrators with shotguns like the Claymore, Reegar, and Piranha or sniper rifles like the Javelin, Black Widow, and CSR are capable of dropping immense burst damage that is unparallelled. One must consider how their kit will do DPS-wise against all defenses, with Armor being the most important. Ammo powers should compensate a weapons/kits weakness against certain defenses, such as Phasic Rounds for a kit that is great against Armor (like the VS) or Incendiary Rounds for a kit that is great against Shields/Barriers (like the Turian Ghost with his TC-boosted Overload).

In the case of the VS, Phasic Rounds on the Venom (which is already capable of high burst DPS and the ability to charge shots) will take care of Barriers and Shields on every enemy and is particularly effective against minions like Geth Hunters and Marauders due to its staggering force and small AoE effect. Flamer, especially in conjunction of Cluster Grenades for Fire Explosions, does great damage against all enemies and absolutely chews through Armor. Flamer can also take advantage of the Incendiary Rounds bug to deal even more damage. 

In the case of the BHS, we should go on a side tangent on Warp Rounds and Warp Rounds IV in particular. Warp Rounds in general should be reserved for Biotics only as they allow Biotics can deal intense weapons damage that rivals Soldiers and a few Infiltrators. So Warp Rounds IV deals 65% damage to Armor and Health and 130% to Barriers. If the target is primed for a Biotic Explosion (such as getting hit with Warp), these percentages double to 130% to Health and Armor and 260% to Barriers. So basically Biotics that can prime can supercharge weapon damage through the roof and is the ammo of choice for Biotics outside of Incendiary cheese (only suggested on the Reegar).

Now back to the DPS portion, the Acolyte can deal with Shields and Barriers with ease (Barriers more so with Warp Rounds). The Hurricane is also a high DPS weapon and Warp/Warp Rounds both debuff Armor such that the armor damage reduction penalty is zero when shooting a Warped enemy. With the addition of an SMG Rail Amp, the Hurricane is certainly a heavy hitter for it's weight. If I added a Pistol Rail Amp instead, I could deal with boss and Phantom Barriers much more easily, but I wanted to down boss armor much quicker so I chose the SMG Rail Amp. To complement the amped up Hurricane, Warp + Throw can formed supercharged Biotic Explosions to finish off enemies. And when I mean supercharged, I mean it's one of the best around, dealing ~6,000 damage per explosion on Armor and Barriers.

* *Support*- While vague, Support is seen all the time. Debuffs, distractions, and healing are all forms of support players can use game. Debuffs help the most as there are many bosses on Platinum that benefit from being debuffed and they directly contribute to DPS. Distractions force enemies to switch targets, buying precious time to aid a teammate or to open up an attack of opportunity. It's much easier to shoot when no one is shooting you. Finally, healing keeps teammates alive means they can deal damage. This type of support has a caveat as the ""lost"" time spent healing should be made up by damage output. Staying alive means nothing unless you are dealing damage to the enemy. Looking at you, Mr. Scrubbernaut.

In the case of the VS, both the Venom and Cluster Grenades means I can attack beyond the line of sight and stagger them. Staggering enemies is like a distraction as they reel from the damage, buying precious time for allies to move or hit a weak spot. Flamer also causes organic Health to panic, preventing them from firing back (Marauders in particular). 

In the case of the BHS, Warp grants a 15% debuff that is quite appreciable with all the high-damaging capabilities at his disposal. Throw has an amazing force as well, stunning enemies it hits and capable of homing around corners. The Acolyte is also capable of hitting enemies around corners if aimed right. Finally, Tech Armor can be detonated to stagger enemies, even through walls. 

Both of these kits aren't great examples of support, so just keep in mind how to support allies when you are trying a more support-oriented kit like the Volus Engineer and Quarian Soldier.


* *Special Tricks and Tactics*- Finally, there are special considerations in mind that you need to take in mind with your build. Special tricks and tactics can be used to round out a build. These are the little things that can improve the above three aspects. Things like hitting damage/force thresholds, the ability to use animations to your advantage, and interesting power interactions all fall under this category. For example, if you have Marksman or Adrenaline Rush active Seeker Swarms/Plagues will not affect your cooldowns. Another example is adding Phasic Rounds III to a Javelin X, which allows for a single bodyshot to kill most minions. In fact, I encourage you to look through both videos in their entirety and try to find as many tricks as possible. You could put them in the comments as a form of mental exercise. A thorough understanding of one's kit drastically improves the effectiveness of said kit.

In the case of the VS, the Venom can be charged and shot in a whole slew of animations including sprinting and [screaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWPtCpLluqE#t=1m55s). Flamer can also be used to [hide the animation of the Venom's reload](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWPtCpLluqE#t=15m55s) and I can use the Venom to drop a [Phantom's Barriers to force her to cloak as soon as she gets unstaggered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWPtCpLluqE#t=18m55s). Flamer can be cancelled early for a quicker recharge and the Venom itself has [a thousand tricks to it](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19zwly/fangs_of_fury_venom_shotgun_discussion/).

In the case of the BHS, I can Throwsling minions with ease. Throwslinging is the act of launching an Acolyte shot (even when sprinting) to drop an enemy's Shields/Barriers and then [hitting them with Throw to ragdoll them, which usually results in their death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3Mix8kv_bY#t=6m15s). Unfortunately I cannot one-shot Phantom Barriers without a Heavy Barrel or Pistol Rail Amp, but I am satisfied with the current setup's extra punch against boss Armor. You will also notice that I use Throw a lot as it has a quick cooldown, can detonate all Power Combos (including both of the Huntress powers), and can stagger all non-bosses. Finally, I can use Tech Armor to get that last bit of damage to [stagger and finish off enemies near me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3Mix8kv_bY#t=19m50s).

Stuff found so far

Assault rifle, shotgun and sniper rifle ultra light materials (probably primarily for multiplayer).

Most of the recent single player DLC weapons are getting added to multi player.

That said, there's a few bits and pieces that may well tie into the ""reckoning"" multiplayer DLC, including that new game mode that appeared in the last one.

Okay, based on what I've found so far I'd say this ""leaked"" description of the new multiplayer DLC is likely legit

Okaaay, so I think I've confirmed the co-op mode. That's in there, at least it seems like it - we're looking at a multiplayer game mode that pulls your paragon/renagade values, reputation points and updates your plot progress from the single player campaign

You can see my current build [here](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#16NPANRl1q2OBMPQ4R4L4N4).

So I've been doing a lot of random pubs on Gold as well as FBWGG runs with this guy, and having a lot of fun. This build regularly contends for the top two spaces on the leader board, and I have frankly fallen in love with the Missile Launcher Power. My guy is at level 18 right now, but as soon as he hits 20 I'm going to try him in some Platinum runs and see if he can really be solid.


**How it Works**
WIth this build you are playing a beefy, consistent, mid-to-long range damage machine. The biggest advantage of the Missile Launcher is the every-three-second stagger paired without he bonus DPS that does not interrupt your weapon damage. If you are blasting away with a  Typhoon, you never have to pause to launch multi-frag grenades. You also don't need to go snatch up grenades to refill your stockpile, leaving them all for the Demolishers who are showing up in just about every gold game nowadays.

Need to switch into Terminator Mode to tank a capture or make a revive? Just turn off the Missile Launcher and you're suddenly as beefy as the other guys are. After you get back into position, or into cover you pop that sucker back on and you're back to bonus DPS.

The only thing you lose, is the spike damage and extra splash stagger that Multi-Frag provides. That means you need to play more conservatively, and can't just dive in guns blazing like the usual mid-to-short range Devastator can.


**Why do It**
The Missile Launcher actually does a lot of things that I like. When building this guy, my focus was on staggering or forcing dodge rolls as often as possible. That meant beefing up the force and radius as much as possible. You aren't depending on this to power to deal lethal damage. You are depending on the power to give you some bonus DPS, and to stagger anything that gets the drop on you.

* Turn the corner into a Pyro? Missile Fires and you run away while they stagger.
* Pop a Medi-Gel at the feet of a Banshee/Phantom? Missile Fires and you don't get res-killed.
* Hunter sneaks up on you while you're scoped? Missile Fires and you swap to a Piranha to melt their face.

It also helps with shield gating. While using a 3-round sniper rifle in Devastator Mode, you end up with a 4-round clip. With the Missile Launcher, you can drop targets that would have taken three shots in just two thanks to the Missile clearing the shields between shot 1 and 2. That means dropping two Geth Rocket Troopers on Gold before reloading.


**The Trick**
The trick to maximizing the Missile Launcher is to never actually enter cover. The Missile doesn't fire while you are up against the wall or ducking. You need to stay out of cover, and depend on actually moving in and out rather than peaking around the corner. On FBW, I usually set up at the corner of the building outside the server room and gun down anything that comes into range. My missiles are firing as frequently as they recharge, and if things get harry I can duck into cover with a 30% shield recharge cooldown. If a Prime is coming up, I just take cover and empty a Piranha or Typhoon into him, and the missile finishes cool down while I'm reloading.


**TL;DR** - The Missile Launcher has actually been pretty fun to use on a sniper-style N7 Destroyer.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1344294781.0,,PS3,True,t3_xs5yw,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/xs5yw/n7_destroyer_or_how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying/,

I felt like seeing us from the viewpoint of the enemy is a really neat thing to do. I just wasn't a fan of his/her casual writing style.

So, after a pulling some strings with the STG, I present to you:

**Cerberus Anti-Specialist Forces Handbook**

**Intro:**

Congratulations on being accepted into Cerberus' elite combat teams. Your enhancements haven't killed you, and neither did the training.

We here at Cerberus have continually fought hard on various planets, liberating them from alien hands. You shall now take up the torch and help prevent krogan uprisings, turian invasions and salarian infiltrations.

Our intelligence have established that the Alliance Military have formed specialized ops groups to invade and hold important stations. They operate in teams of no more than 4, and have effectively shut down many of our manoeuvrings. 

We have compiled a list of these specialized soldiers, and have ranked them according to their combat prowess by colour: Blue (least skilled), Green, Red (Most Skilled), and finally Black, a colour we reserve for enemy soldiers that have the capacity to take down entire detachments by themselves.

*Please note that this handbook is required reading for all Centurion-class, Phantom-class and Dragoon-class units.*

***CHAPTER 1: ADEPTS***

* Code-name for biotic operatives, do not judge them by the gun they wield. Many missions have failed due to underestimating unarmed Adepts.

**Human (Class-A)** *Rank: Red*

Identified by their goggle-like helmet, Class-A human Adepts are crowd-control specialists. Often only armed with a Heavy Pistol or SMG, they focus on disorienting you, lifting you or panicking you before you even engage your target. The abilities they employ are all visible upon firing, so combat rolls are highly effective to dissipate their effectiveness. Avoid the Singularities they set up, as well as any comrade who has been hit by their Warp, due to a possible incoming Biotic Explosion. 

Focused fire on this Adept often forces them into cover, as their barriers have shown to be easily taken down. Do not wonder what their battle-strategy is, shoot to kill on sight.

*Phantom-class specialists have been issued with hexagonal disruption shielding that will block these abilities. Phantoms are warned to watch the shield generator's temperature, as prolonged use as well as moving the shield may burn out the generator.

**Asari (Class A)** *Rank: Red*

The asari have used biotics since before we've known them, and have used it on the battlefield extremely effectively. Their most effective ability has been shown to be what they call 'Stasis'. Depending on each individual, the asari Class-A Adept have stopped troopers in their tracks, either rending their armour nigh-useless to incoming fire or extending the Stasis to include the trooper's allies. Dragoon-class units, as well as Atlas Infantry Fighting Exoskeleton, have found to be immune to Stasis' effect, due to the armour's hydraulics. The also use Warps much like the human Class-A Adept, but combine it with the usually ineffective Throw. By itself, Throw can toss an unshielded soldier with a huge blow, but combined with the aforementioned Stasis or Warp can trigger a Biotic Explosion, decimating groups of Cerberus soldiers.

As with many Adepts, offensive biotics concentrate less on their barriers, causing them to take cover often in the face of incoming fire.

**Drell** *Rank: Red*

These Adepts arrive onto the battlefield with similar strategies to what you've seen. Their 'Pull"" works similar to a reverse-Throw, and Cluster Grenades can be dealt with basic grenade tactics covered in Basic Training.

These drell, however, use a technique that is dangerous to every class of soldier as well as the various devices we employ. It is known as Reave. Unstoppable, invisible upon use, as well as being able to be used on multiple operatives and on individuals repeatedly, have caused Reave to be known as a slow killshot to those who have faced it. Not only can it eat through Atlas armour in seconds, but it greatly increases the lethality of Pull and the drell's grenades. Reave is able to detonate Biotic Explosions on Pull, and be detonated by Cluster Grenades.

If you are fortunate enough to be warned of a drell Adept of the battlefield, immediately fan out. There have been instances where a single drell has wiped out a whole reinforcement squad in seconds if they are in close proximity to each other. As with other Adepts, focus fire on their weak barriers to force them into cover and flank as needed.

* Soldiers deployed with the Polycrystalline-Composite ""Guardian"" Tactical Shield are warned to never engage a drell Adept. The shield has not been proven to block Reave, and Pull's incredible force has ripped shields from arms... and arms from sockets.

**Asari (Class B)** *Rank: Red*

Engaged similar to a drell Adept, asari Class-B Adepts have learned the deadly ability Reave from their drell allies and adopted strategy of Pull-ing unshielded Cerberus troops into the air for detonation.

These operatives have another trick up their sleeve, however. The aptly named 'Biotic Sphere' surrounds the Adept in a dome that slows down gunfire to reduce the effect it has on the target. Battlefield vids have shown it to be about 3 meters in radius, with some reports of it reaching almost 4. Close range operatives, such as Phantom- and Dragoon-class units, must be warned that some Biotic Spheres have a deadly Warp-like affect that drastically reduces armour's protection and sets up deadly Biotic Explosions.

Smoke grenades as well as fragmentation grenades are very useful to get the asari to leave her protective bubble, opening her up to gunfire that can easily wipe out her barriers.

**Cerberus Phoenix Traitor** *Rank: Red-Priority*

Unfortunately, some Cerberus operatives have turned their back on humanity, and have engaged against their former allies. More than one Phoenix-training facility has been destroyed or eliminated due to Cerberus psychologists confirming that the enhancements took, when they did not. 

Training skirmishes with Dragoon-class allies have shown us effective tactics to engaging Phoenix Traitors. Stay far away, avoid their biotic whips, use smoke grenades to disorient them and open fire.

They are not enemies to be laughed at, however. Phoenix Traitors have continued training after their treachery. They've shown to have learned from their human Class-A Adept allies the Singularity, increasing their long-range effectiveness.

Proving that there's no depth to which these back-stabbers will sink, they've taken on alien-developed tactics. Upon seeing asari and drell use Pull effectively, Phoenix Traitors have perfected the ability known as 'Lash'. Instead of floating their adversaries, leaving them open for further attacks, Lash means to kill or incapacitate the enemy with the attack itself. Lash stumbles Atlases, and can send anyone else into a wall at bone-breaking speeds. Somehow, they have even developed a way to penetrate our shielding technology, as well as barriers, in order for most of Lash's force to be applied to the body as well. Phantom-class units have been issued extra fuel for their jet-propelled movement systems to help recover from Lash.

Forces are ordered to take as many Phoenix Traitors alive as possible. These deserters are not a lost hope. Further enhancements can be issued to return them to Cerberus, as well as extra countermeasures to prevent this from happening again.

**Human (Class B)** *Rank: Black*

Class-B human Adepts (dubbing themselves 'Furies') have been honing their biotic talents for decades. Ceberus intelligence have yet to infiltrate and learn anything about the training they received at the Interplanetary Combatives Academy in Rio de Janerio, Brazil, Earth. At this Academy, they have unlocked the secret to minor teleportation, showing it with this specialized soldier as well as the Class-B human Vanguard known as 'Slayers' and the turian Cabal Vanguard. 

Battlefield vids have shown that these Adepts emit a field that applies a biotic effect on any adversary within a given radius. This effect is often detonated in succession by a rapid flurry of Throws.

Human Class-B Adepts have also learned a puzzling technique that some have called 'Dark Channel'. Intelligence has reported that this technique was discovered by the Collectors, but since both Cerberus and the Alliance Navy have both been in conflict with the Collectors for some time, further infiltration is needed to find out the origin of Dark Channel.

Origin aside, we have seen first-hand what Dark Channel can do. Meet Reave's brother. Like Reave, it's invisible, quick, deadly and able to be detonated. The differences are that it's unstable enough that one Adept cannot apply Dark Channel to multiple targets and that it does not cease upon death. Once Dark Channel kills its target, it 'jumps' to the next nearest target, reapplying its deadly effect. Soldiers have been known to panic and desert allies as soon as Dark Channel covers them. The combined effects of Channel as well as the mysterious aura that surrounds the Fury Adept has been known to kill a Dragoon-class unit in seconds.

Engaging this target has proved to be extremely difficult to all except the most sure-shot Nemesis-ranked sharpshooters. Do not engage in close-quarters, even when said target runs directly at your gun. Stay back, fire quickly, and retreat when your Centurion officer orders to you.

He covers how the Omnibow functions and how to get the most out of it. There's also a hint at the end that he might get some buffs in the future.*

*Post link: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/16075348/1#16075348*

I thought I would write a quick post with some tips on the Talon Engineer. I think the team underestimated how much of a niche character this guy is, and it isn’t always obvious how to spec him to get a lot of damage out of his omni-bow. Below is a guide for a high-damage omni-bow build.

**Overview**

The Omni-Bow is considered a melee ability, so it is affected by all melee damage bonuses. If you activate Armor Piercing or Concussive Arrows, you are adding additional power damage to your arrows in addition to the regular melee damage. For a build that maximizes bow damage, the melee portion of your bow damage always exceeds the power portion of your bow damage, so you should maximize melee damage bonuses and then fill with power damage bonuses.

**1) Maximize melee damage bonuses**

To maximize bow damage, you need to stack as many melee damage bonuses as you can because all of them increase your bow damage.

- Take ranks 4a, 5a, and 6a in your Omni-Bow Mastery passive power.
- Use an Omni-Blade or any other melee mods on your weapon. Due to the way the math works on these mods (they add a multiplicative damage bonus after all other bonuses), they have a massive impact on your melee damage
- Use the Hydraulic Joints or other melee damage bonus gear if you can afford not taking grenade gear
- Use a Strength Enhancer consumable

**2) After melee damage, stack power damage**

- Take ranks 4b and 5a in your Elite Mercenary passive power to maximize power damage bonuses, which will affect the damage done from additional power damage of Armor Piercing and Concussive Arrows.
- Take a Power Amplifier consumable since there is no melee damage bonus in this category

**3) Bow Powers**

- The bow damage by itself isn’t huge, but when you activate Armor Piercing Arrows you get 2 shots of this enhanced bow damage, which drastically increases damage done to armor with good damage to all other resistances and health as well.
- Keep activating bow powers as you consume charges to ensure you always have power charges when you fire your bow. The number of charges is displayed as arrows attached to your character’s right shoulder.
- To maximize bow damage, use Armor Piercing Arrows and take all damage evolutions
- Take rank 6a, which adds an extra arrow to your shots. This will increase melee damage as well since you are firing an extra arrow that will have a melee portion and power portion to its damage.

**4) Use heavy melee to get all arrows to hit the same target**

The bow has 2 firing modes. If you tap the melee button, your arrows fly off in a cone but usually only 1 arrow will hit each target. If you hold the melee button, your arrows will focus in on the center. Once they are at the center you can release the bow to get all the arrows to shoot straight ahead.

**5) Locking onto targets**

The bow has a lock-on mechanic that uses the same targeting as powers to determine who it will hit. To hit targets, ensure that you have them highlighted (just like you would if you fired a power like Incinerate). Once you have a target highlighted and hold the melee button, your camera will lock on to that target and your arrows should seek to him when you release the bow. Enemies can dodge your arrows just like any other power.

**Conclusion**

The team is keeping a close eye on the Talon Engineer to make sure he is a viable kit at all difficulty levels. We do have some ideas for changes to make him easier to use, but I encourage you to play around with him and use this guide or come up with a better one :)",[Official],False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,Cerberus,True,t3_19gk5l,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19gk5l/the_lovely_eric_fagnan_writes_up_some_tips_on_how/,
1359109489.0,62,self.MECoOp,178zwt,ME Co-Op College 408:  Store,73,11,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/178zwt/me_coop_college_408_store/,"####OVERVIEW

This guide covers the known and speculated mechanics of the Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer Store.  Rather than a detailed breakdown of each pack type, the guide analyzes the value of buying different types of goods (e.g. consumables, Ultra-Rare weapons) with respect to pack type.  The values are mathematically obtained through the cost / mechanics of the pack, or through data collected from users in this subreddit.  There is a degree of uncertainty on some numbers - the guide will disclose when that is the case.  Finally, the guide covers some suggested buying strategies and tips.

For clarity and brevity, this guide uses some abbreviations and terminology.  For packs:  Recruit Packs (RPs), Veteran Packs (VPs), Jumbo Equipment Packs (JEPs), Spectre Packs (SPs), Premium Spectre Packs (PSPs), Arsenal Packs, (APs), and Reserve Packs (ResPs).  *'Consumables'* refers to Rockets, Medigel, Ops Packs, and Thermal Clips.  *'Items'* refers to Characters, Weapons, Weapon Mods, or Gear, and *'Equipment'* refers to Ammo (e.g. Incendiary II), Armor Modules (e.g. Cyclonic Modulator III), and Weapon Amps (e.g. Shotgun Rail Amp I).  Finally, Ultra-Rare is abbreviated to 'UR'.

####PACKS

Each pack has five slots, except for the JEP, which has 10.  Each of those slots can unlock only certain classes of goods.  For instance, the first slot of every pack is dedicated to unlocking consumables (or equipment when consumables are maxed), and the last slot of every non-JEP is dedicated to items or equipment.

The following table shows the cost and content of each of the packs.

Pack|Cost|# of Consumable Slots|Quantity of Consumable|# of Item Slots|Default Item Rarity|# of Equipment / Other Slots|Equipment Level
:---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
RP|5000|2|1|1|Common|2|I
VP|20000|2|3|1|Uncommon|2|II
JEP|33000|4|5|0|n/a|6|I to III
SP|60000|1|5|1|Rare|3|III
PSP|99000|1|5|2|Rare|3|III
AP|99000|1|5|2|Rare|3|III
ResP|99000|1|5|2|Rare|3|III

There are some exceptions to the equipment levels, and those occur when you have maxed certain portions of your manifest (e.g. all your Uncommon Weapons or consumables).

####CONSUMABLES

The following table shows the expected number of consumables earned from each pack type, per million credits spent.

Pack|# of Consumables
:---|:--:
RP|400
VP|300
JEP|600+
SP|83
PSP / AP / ResP|50

Lower-tier packs unlock consuambles at much higher rates.  In particular, JEPs unlock consumables at a 12x rate when compared to PSPs, APs, and ResPs.  If you're low on medigel or rockets and you are desperate for a quick boost of consumables, consider some of the lower-tier packs.  JEPs obviously offer the best value, but for other reasons (covered below), you may want to choose another pack like a VP.

Note, the '+' on JEPs in the table is because they often unlock a '+2' consumable in one of the equipment slots in addition to the 4 '+5' slots.  Unfortunately, not enough data has been collected to determine the actual rate at which these '+2' consumables drop.  Regardless, JEPs offer by far the best value for consumables alone.

####EQUIPMENT

The middle slots of packs most often produce equipment, but they can produce other goods such as 'Reset Power' Cards or Common Characters (even if you have maxed them).  Item slots (the most rightward slots) can also unlock equipment, in particular when you have maxed a part of your manifest.  For instance, if you have maxed your Uncommon weapons, the right-most slot in a VP will usually give you level III equipment instead (the other two middle slots will usually give you level II equipment).  Likewise, in an SP or PSP, the item slots will give you level IV equipment if you have maxed your Rare weapons and characters (unless you get an UR weapon).

The following table shows the expected number of drops of each equipment level, per million credits spent. It ignores middle slots that drop items instead of equipment (for reasons that are explained below).  For higher-tier packs (SP+), it also assumes maxed Uncommon Weapons.  The question marks in the table indicate values for which there are insufficient data to draw conclusions.

Pack|Level I|Level II|Level III|Level IV
:---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
RP|400|?|0|0
VP|0|100-|low?|lower / possible?
VP w/Maxed Uncommon Items|0|100|50|lower / possible?
JEP|60|60|50|0
SP|0|0|50-|&lt;1
SP w/Maxed Rare Items|0|0|50-|17
PSP / AP / ResP|0|0|20-|&lt;1
PSP / AP / ResP w/Maxed Rare Items|0|0|20-|20

The '-' symbols in the table account for items that will drop in place of equipment.  Generally speaking, based on the data available, these drops occur at &lt;=25%, and they appear to hit each pack roughly proportionately.  So, while the numbers in the table may not be accurate in these cases, the relative value in the packs should be roughly correct.  A '50' has more value than a '50-', which means that VPs are technically the best pack for maximizing level III equipment once you have maxed your Uncommon items.
 
Notable takeaways from this analysis are that level III equipment drops at nearly equal rates in VPs, JEPs, and SPs.  Higher-tier packs (i.e. ones that cost 99000) are an inferior option for unlocking combined level III and IV equipment compared to SPs, especially for players with maxed Rare manifests.  An SP for a character with a maxed Rare manifest will unlock level III+ equipment 33% faster in SPs than in the more expensive packs.  Still, a VP with a maxed Uncommon / Rare manifest will gain more than double the volume equipment (2/3 of which will be level II), when compared to SPs.

####ITEMS

The table below shows the expected number of item drops per million credits spent.  URs have been skipped for this analysis, as they are covered below.  There was insufficient data on unlock rates for Uncommon Characters / Weapons, so the table assumes those have been maxed.  It also assumes that none of the Rare items have been maxed.

Pack|Uncommon Mods|Uncommon Gear|Rare Weapons|Rare Characters|Rare Weapon Mods|Rare Gear
:---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
VP|2.0|8.0|low|low|low|low
SP|3.9\*|1.4\*|6.8|4.7|4.1|3.8
PSP|?|?|6.7|4.7|4.0|4.2
AP|3.3\*|1.9\*|12.1|low|1.3|5.0
ResP|low|low|low|13.3|low|5.2

\* Small sample size

The conclusion here is that for any Rare item, SPs and PSPs appear to have similar buying value.  This may be somewhat surprising given that SPs have half the Rare slots but at 60% of the price.  It appears this can largely be explained by SPs unlocking Rare Mods in their 4th (non-Rare) slot rather frequently.  Once you have maxed your Rare Mods, PSPs will offer a better value for Rare Items.  But if you're leveling up your entire Rare manifest, the two packs will offer nearly identical value for Rare Items.  Given the benefits of extra equipment and consumables from SPs, they may offer a better overall value.

VPs are by far the best value for Uncommon Gear, but SPs, counterintuitively, offer a better value for Uncommon Mods.  It's advisable to mix in some SPs early on to help unlock these Mods.

Arsenal Packs are an intriguing option for someone leveling up their manifest - you can make progress on Uncommon Items at a decent rate while leveling up your Rare Weapons and Gear.  Unfortunately, they do yield very little equipment, and as with all 99000 credit packs, the yield on consumables is very low.

####ULTRA-RARES

This is the topic that is of most interest to many people, and unfortunately, the data collected does not offer any definitive conclusions with respect to the best packs for unlocking UR weapons, for a number of reasons.  First of all, there is nearly incontrovertible statistical evidence that the UR weapon drop rates can change.  Data collected on day-of-DLC has shown drop rates doubling for UR weapons in PSPs, APs, and ResPs.  Secondly, obtaining estimates of low-probability events is much more difficult than for high-probability ones.

That said, the current best estimates of UR weapon drop rates in non-DLC time-frames are 7.5% in SPs, and 15% in PSPs, APs, and ResPs.  Given the cost of SPs is higher, these estimates project that you will unlock URs about 18% faster with the 99000 credit packs.

You should take these numbers with a grain of salt, given the potential statistical error.  The SP numbers are seemingly the most reliable, as they have the largest sample, and there has never been evidence that the UR drop rate has changed in them.  For the other packs, it is very possible that numbers reported have been biased by day-of-DLC effects.  If the true rate for the 99000 credit packs is somewhere closer to 12-13%, (as has been measured in the past for PSPs), then SPs and PSPs would have no difference in value for URs.

Note, UR characters appear to drop at a higher rate than UR weapons, though the exact difference is unclear based on the data collected.

####MISCELLANEOUS

* If your goal is to unlock more equipment, there is merit to saving your credits and buying packs in large spending sprees.  The reason is that once you have maxed your consumables, packs will unlock equipment in their slots instead.

* Each piece of equipment has a maximum value of 255.  If you go beyond that when buying packs, the value will be reset to 255 when you restart the game.

* Anecdotally, some Uncommon Weapon Mods do not appear to unlock through packs lower than SPs.  After maxing your Uncommon Weapons, it is advisable to mix in some higher-tier packs (best to start with SPs).

* Upgrades to your consumable capacity can be unlocked through VPs and up.  There isn't enough data to recommend which packs are most efficient for doing this (though it is likely that SPs and higher are best, as they offer more Rare slots).

* ResPs unlock Common Character cards 50% of the time in one of the equipment slots.  This is effectively 100000 wasted credits for each million spent on ResPs.

* Among SPs, PSPs, ResPs, and APs, the latter is the only pack not to unlock Common Character cards.  Thus, for someone with a maxed Rare manifest looking to maximize their UR chances, APs may be the best value.


####CONCLUSIONS

People frequently ask about spending strategy in the store, and the answer depends on their goals.  For new players, it's advisable to max your Common inventory through RPs, as many of the Weapon Mods in those will be useful later on.  As a next step, maxing your Uncommon Weapons through VPs will substantially increase the value of those packs, since level III equipment will begin unlocking instead of weapons.  This equipment will be critical when moving up in difficulties.

That said, for maximum enjoyment of the game, a mix of packs is likely to be most gratifying.  If you feel like unlocking new weapons, try APs.  For new characters, try ResPs.  Or, for a mix of equipment and characters / weapons / mods, stick with SPs or PSPs.  The most effective buying strategies will involve keeping your supply of consumables and equipment at a decent level, while unlocking new characters / weapons for the sake of fun.  A mix of packs will accomplish this.

The idea is that there would be multiple versions of each enemy faction (Geth/Cerberus/Reaper), each with its own distinct character. Keep the same lineup of enemies if you must, but tweak them here or there. Some enemies might have different stats, or spawn in different numbers. Make up a little bit of background on each army to give it some flavor, and serve.

The benefit of this would be some added variety: A common request among ME3 Co-op players who are starting to cool off on fighting the same enemies each time. This would vary the bad guys a little bit: You might spec a particular soldier build to take on the high number of Atlases that one Cerberus army employs. You might find it's riskier to blindly randomize your enemies because not all your characters are equipped to take on Ravagers with shields.

And at the same time, it wouldn't require any additional game assets to be created. Presumably, it would be easier to introduce this mechanic than it would be to add ME2 game content (mercs, collectors) or to add new enemies (new Reaper units, some kind of Cerberus gunship would all be cool but are almost definitely never going to happen).

Here's some examples. Some are just ""More of X in a wave, but less of Y."" Some mess with the stats, and so would actually require some work by Bioware. And some actually alter the abilities of enemies, and so might be too much work to accomplish.

* This Reaper force is commanded by Harbinger itself. Absolution's numbers seem to be limitless, and it overwhelms its enemies using swarm tactics.

* Traits: All enemies have 20% more health/shields/armor/barrier. Banshee teleportation range is increased.

*Hephaestus Cell*

* This Cerberus task force is an elite assault unit that takes on assignments from the Illusive Man himself.

Their health is piss poor, and shields are average.  However, they have a power that restores their shields instantly, in addition to those of any nearby allies.  They have a roll, which is as useful as rolls tend to be.  Their heavy melee creates a bubble shield, which appears to stop enemy fire.  You can't leave the shield standing, though; once you end the melee, it goes away.

The engineer's unique power is tactical mine, which is like proxy.  Same basic function (debuff/damage with wide radius), but stronger/higher cooldown.  It also has the ability to scan the area of the its placed, revealing enemies ala hunter mode.

The adept gets biotic orbs.  These appear to buff your cooldowns when they're out, to a greater degree when you have more of them (3 orbs default, 4 max).  Though they have quite the cooldown, you can chuck them at your enemies as soon as you cast it, making it hands down the most potent biotic attack in the game (in terms of raw damage).  Also, one of the final evolutions offers an enemy debuff (15% damage increase, all sources.  Stacks with each orb hit).  In a nutshell, they're awesome!

Here's what makes all the difference: Devastator Mode.  No other class offers such a perfect solution to the biggest drawbacks of the PR.  A short refresher on DM's abilities, and a bit about how they work with the PR.

One, the PR has to build up to reach full force. Getting staggered is...not good.  DM takes care of that.  No more staggers, even from bosses.  Fire away.

Another thing DM does?  Added ammo.  The advantage of that for *any* weapon is apparent, but due to the way in which the PR operates, having as much ammo as possible is an absolute necessity.  

Okay, that's two bonuses of DM, one more to go: rate of fire.  Now, because the PR builds up its beam based on consecutive shots fired, spitting them out as fast as possible is obviously the way to roll if you want to deal your damage faster.  Drawback:  you run out of ammo faster, duh.  That's *not good* for the PR. That will be addressed in a bit.

You have a base RoF and ammo increase from DM, and the (I think) 5th evolution offers a choice between ammo increase and RoF.  I chose RoF, and equip spare ammo through mods and gear if need be.  That's entirely up to you though.

Now, a *MASSIVE* advantage of DM:  **you can reload cancel the PR.**  

*WHAAAAAAAAT?*

YES!  Spit all the ammo out of that bitch, you can reload cancel the fuck out of it!  Here's how you magic that bastard into submission:  You roll DM all the time with the PR, right?  What, you don't?  Are you retarded or something?  Turn it on!  Now, see that nice fat ammo increase?  Burn it up.  Unleash that shit into the face of the nearest unlucky son of a bitch, bukkake style.  Using up all the ammo requires a ~5 second cooldown animation on top of waiting for your ammo to recharge, right?  WRONG!  Turn off DM!  Now turn it back on!

BAM! RELOADED!

""But Jockey, I have a 4-5 second cooldown on DM!""

*FOOL!* What is your build!? You don't need anything but the PR! 

I am built entirely for weapon damage (no weight bonuses), and my PR III leaves me with a two-second cooldown.  When I turn on DM *to start*, I have 227 ammo (ext. mag mod); if I burn through all the ammo, then reload cancel with DM, I end up with ~3/4 of that *immediately*, and it's at full recharge speed, meaning I have full ammo a small fraction of a second after that. 

This character eats through Gold like my fat ass through a bowl of grits.  AP and extended mag mods, warfighter V gear (I have no points in missile launcher because it makes you less of a kickass tank, so warfighter is perfect), and Cyclonic Modulator for extra time in the line of fire.  Whatever Ammo Bonus you take will be applied quickly and often, even moreso due to DM's RoF.  For that reason, I choose Incendiary Ammo. Depending on the Ammo's rank, I can stop firing on a Boss with as much as two bars of armor/health left and let the stacked burning do the rest.  Don't try it at first, you'll get yourself killed.  Actually, don't try it at all.  It's my tactic. *Mine.*

**TL;DR: DM makes that shit approximately forty-seven fofillion times better, and lets you reload cancel.**

Totally not an edit - Oh yeah, you can DM-cancel out of a Banshee's Warp effects just like a PR reload.  That's always nice.

Totally an edit - Well, don't I look silly.  There *is* a set build-up time for the PR (2 seconds), so there's your reason to go for ammo capacity over RoF - though I'll stick with RoF due to sheer DPS.  You still end up using less ammo with a higher RoF.  Also, there aren't any mods to increase your RoF, but there *are* mods to increase your ammo.  Double-Also, my Destroyer isn't built for this weapon; this weapon just happened to fit it perfectly.  Still, your choice may vary, especially with this new info.

Totally another edit - Holy shit, I guess you have to read the replies or I'll be here all day adding edits.  Seems some folks don't understand and/or are confused by some of the stuff I have here.  It isn't the first time, and won't be the last, I'm afraid :/

I love this multiplayer, and I've had more fun with it than with most other MP modes, but I can't deny the truth much longer...

Even with the incredible amount of depth that the class system brings to ME3CoOP, there just is not enough variety between Geth, Cerberus and Reapers in a handful of maps that ultimately are not diverse enough to matter. You can tweak builds until your heart's content, but even with a Gold viable super-class, it's still the same damn game against the same damn three sets of enemies. Sure, those with maxed out rares can squeeze a little more enjoyment out of mixing and matching high-level weapons with classes, but meanwhile the mid-level players are stuck grinding Silver over and over and over again. It just doesn't seem like a sustainable formula to me. It's lasted for a long time, much longer than I expected, and Bioware should be commended for that.

Why bother, the number is worthless.

My idea is to provide a strong additional incentive for players to keep levelling: make N7 guns more common for those with higher N7 ranks. 

Maybe I'm alone in thinking that the N7 guns are just far too rare and should be made more common, but I also don't want them to just be everywhere. I think that Bioware should make it so that every 50 levels of N7 rank increases the chance for a black to appear in a spectre pack by 1% so that a level 100 character would have a 2% chance for them to show up, a level 300 would have a 6% chance, and so on. No inbetween increases, only at every 50th level. This would give players who have devoted more time and effort to the game access to more powerful weapons while keeping them rare and special; someone below level 50 couldn't even acquire one.

Tactical Cloak: Duration, Melee Damage, Bonus Power

Electric Slash: Edit: Damage

Shadow Strike: Damage, Electric Damage, Damage

N7 Shadow: Power Damage/Capacity (just for the capacity)

Sword Mastery: Sword Damage, Martial Artist, Edit: Shield Damage I thought about it and I realized shield damage would be a lot more effective against Cerberus, because the only armored targets are atlases, which I can barely hurt anyway, meanwhile almost everything is shielded and I can't one hit kill a few things, but having shield effectiveness allows me to. I know the flaming sword is cool and all, but the electro sword is much more effective.

I also took rank 5 of N7 Shadow and put it into rank 4 electric slash because of [this fine gentleman's inquiry](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/wqh6v/very_effective_n7_shadow_build_that_ive_been/c5fpdgn)

__________________________________________________________

So what you're probably thinking is ""why the hell would you choose duration over damage"", that is because if you cloak and shadow strike right away you can get two kills in one cloak cycle, and more importantly remain cloaked after the first kill. If you were to pick damage over duration, you would get one cloak cycle with 140% damage (assuming martial artist is active), also leaving yourself completely vulnerable afterwards. With duration, you can cloak and shadow strike and still have at least 5 seconds of cloak remaining, which you can use to get a 100% damage bonus (w/ martial artist) or finish off anyone with a heavy melee that will also do 100% extra. Most mooks, including phantoms will die after one cloaked shadow strike along with the electrical damage afterwards, thus the 40% damage bonus is redundant. 

Another thing is if you do what I did and don't evolve electrical slash, do not detonate tech bursts sourced by shadow strike with it, it will do very little damage. It is better to heavy melee or shadow strike again. The only reason I keep electric slash is because one cloak&gt;shadow strike will leave a turret with about 4 bars of armor, and standing next to a turret yields bad times, but if I cloak&gt;electric slash&gt;shadow strike it will kill it straight up. 

Another thing, don't shadow strike atlases with shields up because you won't do much damage and you will probably end up dying. I have yet to been grabbed by a banshee if I cloak&gt;shadow strike&gt;back roll&gt;shadow strike&gt;repeat.

When we lost on the extraction round due to our team not setting up a proper perimeter, I shrugged it off. Who cares about a tiny bit of XP, am I right? Even as a Level 8 character.

By contrast, this weekend was a collection of some of the most rageworthy moments I've subjected myself to in gaming. I tend to evaluate my time spent in Gold on a credit/hour basis, and was getting so frustrated with the inexperienced players. My combat was almost mechanical--cloak, headshot, cloak, headshot or warp, throw, warp, throw--and I was constantly in cover. Every Gold match that ended before Round 10 was an utter waste of my time, and I resented the hell out of it. Every player who didn't play in the way I expected/desired was either a noob or an idiot (depending on their N7 level).

Originally a weapon only accessible to Soldiers, the Revenant ran over enemies like a lawnmower. When coming to Mass Effect 3, it had nearly every aspect nerfed. This makes players yearn for memories back when they were hideously powerful (see: every weapon in ME2). Still, in the right hands the Revenant is a powerful weapon whose weaknesses can be easily negated with preparation. 

Personally, this is one of my favorite guns in the game once the issues of the guns have been worked around as there really isn't another gun (maybe besides the Hurricane) that can shoot like the Revenant. It has a huge magazine, does excellent damage (needs AP for Armor), and has a great rate of fire that gives me a bit of guilty pleasure when using it.

_________________________

*Why do players not like the Revenant in ME3?*

**I wanted Quality, NOT QUANTITY!**- The biggest issue the Revenant has is it's accuracy/stability handling. Of all of the assault rifles, it has by far the worst combined handling of accuracy and recoil. That means that without preparation you will never be able to hit anything beyond arms length. And those fixes tend to require specialized mods and equipment, thus forcing the player down a narrow route of choice in order to continue using the Revenant. In particular, the accuracy is what turns many players away as most assault rifles have *very* good accuracy at range.

**Once again, I wanted Quality NOT QUANTITY!**- In addition to the aforementioned handling issues, the Revenant also has a relatively low damage/pellet stat. This means that the enemies that you can easily hit like Atlases and Praetorians will easily deflect said bullets with armor damage reduction. This also means that the Revenant requires more time out of cover than most assault rifles to get the damage out to Armor, putting the user at a bigger risk than most guns.

**No running and gunning allowed**- Whilst firing the Revenant, the player is forced to walk and not run like many other weapons. The only other weapon with this feature is the Reegar Carbine.

**And there's the Harrier...**- Like any assault rifle, there's inevitable comparison to the Harrier. The only apparent advantage the Revenant has over the Harrier is ammo capacity whilst falling short in nearly every other category. 

_______________________________________________

*With those issues, why should I take the Revenant out for a spin?*

**DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA**- One of the great features of the Revenant is it's high rate of fire and magazine size. Those two combined allow for the Revenant to deal an enormous amount of damage for a sustained and burst period. Whilst only being out-DPSed by UR ARs and a Mattock with a macro, the Revenant is a powerful weapon and definitely worth its weight to deal damage.

**It's general stats are pretty good**- You don't need laser-like accuracy unless you are sniping across the map. Once the stability issue of the Revenant is locked down, it's accuracy is better than you think. If you try and snipe across the map with it you are using it wrong. It's not the [Bianchi LMG from 2142](http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Bianchi_FA-6_LMG) that gets more accurate as you shoot it. Instead, it's a light machine gun that still has great accuracy at mid-range and will deal it's huge damage output as long as the enemies are inside of its crosshairs. Also, the Revenant has a great ammo capacity in both its magazine and spare ammo (unlike a certain bird-named UR assault rifle), easing the need for extraordinary ammo management. Finally, the Revenant is also of medium weight and thus doesn't kill power recharge times unlike the heavier assault rifles. This makes the Revenant a perfect fit for Soldiers who want to have both high firepower and great cooldowns in one package.

**Easy to use**- There's no trick you have to use with this gun. It's basically a bullet hose. No need to use soft cover for a charge up, hardly a need for constant reload cancelling, and it's hit-scan. Overall a simple yet effective light machine gun. What more could you ask for?

____________________________________________

*Miscellaneous*

**HOT MODS AND EQUIPMENT!**- There's a variety of modifications for this gun to improve its effectiveness. Personally, I always use magazine size and stability on any assault rifle to improve its usability with AP Ammo to deal with Armor. The Revenant benefits a lot from using both of those mods as stability will negate its main weakness and magazine capacity will ensure that it rarely needs to reload. Other good mods include armor penetration mods and the extended barrel if you are going to use AP or Drill Rounds and are getting recoil bonuses from some other source like Turian Veteran and Stabilization Modules. On the equipment side of things, use a stabilization module and Barrage Upgrade if you aren't going to use a stability mod or a Cyclonic Modulator to keep up that huge RoF up at all times. When it comes to ammo types, I highly recommend AP Ammo above all else. With AP Ammo, armor damage reduction (the biggest bane of the Revenant) becomes a non-issue and the ability to penetrate cover will only make it that much better when you want to use soft cover. If AP isn't available, high level Drill Rounds provide an acceptable substitute. If neither of those are around, make sure you have an armor penetration mod on board and choose Incendiary Rounds for additional armor damage.

**Accuracy++ = Tanking++ = Cover++ = Killing++**- To get the absolute best out of the Revenant, you have to tackle the accuracy stat. There are thee main ways to do this. The first is to obviously improve accuracy by powers (I don't find the scope mod to be very helpful because other mods are better) such as Hunter Mode and Marksman. The second it to use the Revenant on a kit that has a lot of Shields and has to get up close to kill enemies such as the Krogan Sentinel and Vanguard. Since the player will be close anyways, the lack of accuracy is hardly a problem with the Revenant as almost all of the bullets will hit anyways. Finally, consider using [hard cover to improve your accuracy](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/18xora/an_acute_observation_cover_and_accuracyrecoil/). It's a noticeable change between being in cover and not in cover.

**And it sounds cool too!**- The Revenant also has a really cool firing sound. I thought I should point that out. I should also point out that the Revenant looks cool too, giving it style points that other guns certainly don't get (sorry PPR, but you do look a bit too alien for my tastes).

_______________________________

And that's why you should use the M-76 Revenant. It's a powerful light machine gun that has a few big issues with it. Fortunately, its issues are easily remedied through equipment and a few powers. Once the issues are fixed, it is a death spewing assault rifle with few, if any, equals. Any equals must sacrifice something, such as the Harrier with its ammo capacity and the Typhoon/PPR with the windup time, in order to be competitive with the Revenant. Players looking for a no-BS machine gun should look towards the Revenant to provide them a solution to their woes.",[Weapon Discussion],False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,,True,t3_1cakqa,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1cakqa/why_you_should_care_for_the_m76_revenant/,
1365637075.0,57,self.MECoOp,1c3kjy,Why You Should Care For: The Uncommon Weapons Pool,69,12,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1c3kjy/why_you_should_care_for_the_uncommon_weapons_pool/,"I guess people love having access to the best weapons. This is obvious for those who complain that they don't have the Harrier, Hurricane, or Black Widow. In protest of the non-productive whining that I see every week, I will give you a decent argument to using these guns. Considering most Uncommon weapons are easy to access and have equivalent counterparts, they shouldn't get as much crap as they do. [Especially the Raptor](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1ae4hi/why_you_should_care_for_the_m13_raptor/), which hardly deserved it. 

_______________________________________
*Why do people whine about the Uncommons?*

**BUT I HAVE THEIR SUPER DAMAGING BROTHER**- Each Uncommon weapon has a Rare/Ultra-Rare equivalent. I put them in this table to see how it works. Players may dismiss the Uncommon weapon because their counterpart tends to be much stronger in terms of damage. Can't fault them for that as most of the Uncommons have quite a low damage/pellet stat.

Weapon Type|Uncommon Variant | Rare/UR Counterpart
|:-|:-|:-
Accurate Burst Assault Rifle | Vindicator | N7 Valkyrie
Heavy Assault Rifle | Mattock | Cerberus Harrier
Balanced Assault Rifle | Phaeston | M-76 Revenant or Collector Assault Rifle
Light Pistol | Phalanx | M-11 Suppressor or N7 Eagle
Rapid Fire Shotgun | Scimitar | N7 Piranha 
High Powered Accurate Shotgun | M-22 Eviscerator | M-11 Wraith 
Bullet Hose SMG | M-9 Tempest | N7 Hurricane
High Accuracy SMG | M-12 Locust | M-25 Hornet or Collector SMG
Light Multi-shot Sniper Rifle | M-97 Viper | N7 Valiant
Hybrid Sniper Rifle | M-13 Raptor | Collector Sniper Rifle
High RoF Sniper Rifle | M-29 Incisor | M-90 Indra

**THIS GUN IS BAD AND IT SHOULD FEEL BAD**- Two Uncommon weapons, the Incisor and Scimitar, are notoriously bad for having a combination of bad stats and the near inability to remedy said stats without burning specific equipment modules. This definitely leaves a sour taste in a few people's mouths.


______________________________________
*And why should I still use the Uncommons?*

**Featherweights**- With the exception of the Incisor, the Uncommon weapons are much lighter than their counterparts while still being capable in their own field. Combined with the fact that the Uncommon weapons are easy to max out, Uncommon weapons are great for when power cooldown is an issue. The prime example is the M-9 Tempest. It is a great bullet hose with the DPS of an Argus, a high-powered assault rifle. The Tempest is significantly lighter than the Argus and pairs well with any high-damaging and heavy weapon like the Crusader, Saber, and Javelin. 

**Ease of Use**- All of the Uncommon weapons have a reasonably quick reload speed (as fast or faster than their counterparts) and great ammo capacity. That means even lower skilled players who miss shots can still deal sustained damage. Great examples include the Phaeston/Tempest with their 90 clip capacity and 450 spare ammo count, and the Viper for it's 6 shot clip (with quick reload). The high ammo capacity also means less stop to ammo boxes thus not forcing the player to play ""Camp the Box"", unlike some *other* *cough HARRIER cough* weapons.

**Overarching Roles**- As a whole, the Uncommon weapons fulfill nearly every archetype of weapon out there from the bullet hoses to the heavy cannons. If you are uncertain about what type of weapon to use, try using an Uncommon weapon. They can meld into any situation that calls for a generic weapon type like ""Street Sweeper"" or  ""Marksman Rifle"". 
______________________________________
*Miscellaneous*

**I am SO mod right now**- Attaching equipment and mods to these guns brings out the best in them. For example, a SMG stability module makes the Tempest act as a mini-Assault Rifle with minimal recoil. AP mods and ammo also helps bypass the armor damage reduction issue, making them fine weapons overall.

**Tiered Weapons**- No one is going to argue that you MUST use these guns on Platinum. Like the Common weapons, you will eventually grow out the Uncommons (or at least most of them). Still, that doesn't make them bad weapons. It's like the Human Infiltrator: relative to all the other Infiltrators it is lackluster. And yet it's still a fine kit nonetheless regardless of what others may think. Same goes for the Uncommon weapons. Relative to Rares and Ultra-Rares, those Uncommon weapons generally don't come close in terms of damage. Still, that doesn't mean they are bad. In fact, they have the great advantage of having much lower weight. That means they work exceptionally well with low level Rares and Ultra-Rares due to the massive weight some of those have.

______________________________________________

And that's why you should use the Uncommon weapons. They are easy to max out, are lightweight, cover almost all the archetypes of weapons, and are easy to use. Don't let your elitism and big gins allow you to make fun of the Uncommons, because **DPS Isn't Everything^tm** .

Okay, since people are wanting to know WHAT IS PSA APPROPRIATE I decided to make a list of proper PSA's and not so proper PSA's.

PSA's should include one of the following: Important news about the multiplayer content of ME3, Bugs that can cause distress to a large number of people, something that can change how a game type or class is played, or the status of servers that either hinder someone's ability to play the game or enable them to play it.

Example PSA's:

PSA: Vanguard bug has gotten worse and now any Biotic Charge will bug you causing the game to crash.

PSA: Bioware announces (that no) new fix in the next patch for Vanguard crash bug.

PSA: PS3 servers are down again with no sign of them coming back online.

And now for examples of of things that should NOT have PSA's in the title.

PSA: New gun X is way too over powered and ruins the game.

PSA: Vanguards should not use Sniper Rifles.

PSA: The new Vorcha heavy melee pushes you foreward when doing X.

These are all things that are not super important but should have a normal thread posted on them. 

AGAIN - The PSA's will not be banned or removed by a mod for not following these guidelines. If one is removed it will be for a different reason. If you post a PSA wrong, be prepared to be downvoted and made fun of in the comments. Unless it breaks the actual guidelines a mod will not help in stopping this. POST PSA'S AT YOUR OWN RISK. This is not a ban nor a temp ban or anything of the sort. This is to let you know what should be classified as a PSA. Thanks. Feel free to comment and discuss this further.

1332696908.0,56,self.MECoOp,rcvbc,The Krogan Living Tank (Krogan Sentinel Gold Guide),61,5,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/rcvbc/the_krogan_living_tank_krogan_sentinel_gold_guide/,"*Disclaimer: As with any guide, everything here is an advice from my own personal experience. You should always look critically at what's suggested and alter it to suit your personal strengths. That said, I have finished gold multiple times with this build and variations of it even below level 20 and being one of the top scorers (Not that it's the purpose, just to show I wasn't carried)*

**THE KROGAN LIVING TANK**

This build focuses on survivability and tanking the brunt of the damage for your team while still offering large amount of firepower. 

I chose the Krogan sentinel due to the high base health of the Krogan race along with the Tech Armor power to reach high amounts of effective health/shields.

This guide is intended for gold difficulty and will laugh at difficulties below it. You may feel like Grunt in his glorious cut-scene.

**Base stats:**

Health: 750

Shields: 1000

**Fully-built stats + Tech Armor:**

Health: 1200 (1,680 Effective)

Shields: 1600 (2,240 Effective)

In comparison, a fitness built Turian has 825 health and 1238 shields - Just edging past the *base* krogan stats.

**Power Build**

Tech Armor: Durability - Melee Damage - Durability

Lift Grenade: Damage - Max Capacity - Damage &amp; Radius

Krogan Berserker: Weapon damage - Headshots - Weapon Damage

Rage: Durability - Shield Recharge/Martial Artist - Fitness Expert


Justification:

* Tech Armor - The explosion isn't worth losing out on damage reduction and 30% melee damage. Also this build utilizes very heavy weapons and forgoes any kind of power enhancements putting the skill on 20 second cooldown should you decide to explode it.

* Lift Grenade - It's either this or incinerate. I find incinerate very lackluster in gold matches even with a fully built power usage character. Lift grenades on the other hand have no cooldown which fits perfectly with our -200% cooldown weapons + tech armor penalty.

  I choose taking damage over increased CC because anything that can be lifted by the grenade is generally either killed by it or not important enough to warrant extra CC. Increased damage/radius is up to preference and how well you find yourself actually aiming the grenades.

* Krogan Berserker - A no-brainer, we don't use any powers outside of the grenades and we don't care about cooldowns.

* Rage - The bonus to health/shields coupled with the extraordinary high health of the krogan race is what makes this build work. Your melee damage is already very high and is adequate to deal with any threats you might want to melee as long as you season it with shotgun pellets.

**Weapons**

M-99 Sabre (Extended Barrel + Armor Piercing) OR Carnifex (Scope + Extended Barrel)

M-300 Claymore OR Geth Plasma Shotgun (High Caliber Barrel + Armor Piercing)

Justification:

* AR: Along with your +damage talents and the extended barrel your sabre will be able to 1-2 shot basic troops/targets stripped of their shields. The Claymore is a 1 shot-reload shotgun with low ammunition so you really don't want to waste it on basic mooks unless necessary.

  The Sabre is quite rare so in the likely case you don't have one, a scoped Carnifex is fine too.

* Shotgun: I tried the many varieties of shotguns and I found that multi shot shotguns don't do significantly more damage than your melee attack yet do not incapacitate the target. The geth shotgun with charged shots might work as a substitute but I did not experiment with it yet.

**General strategies**

The first thing to learn about this build is that while you are extremely tanky, you can still go down very fast. Charging into 3 marauder shields will get you killed and make you a liability. I will discuss specific enemy damage in the faction specific section.

You want to stay close to your team, but not too close - You want the enemies to aim at you. Take a forward position where enemies are most likely to come from (A good example is below the ladder using the wall to the left - Not the chest high - one as cover).

Tech armor should always be active - Exploding it does little and leaves you vulnerable.

Your basic combo against shielded targets is shotgun to center body mass as you are closing in and finishing the target with a healthy dose of Krogan diplomacy (Heavy melee). Not advised against Geth Pyros.

If there are any other Krogan on the team, headbutt them to show them who's the toughest and meanest Krogan in the group. Then headbutt them again.

Your heavy melee will not hit prone targets and will make you look ridiculous. A proud Krogan warrior does not look ridiculous. Headbutting them is fine, though.

Learn to animation cancel - both your weapons greatly benefit from it. The reload animation is longer than the time it takes for the weapon to become loaded. Generally once your character ""inserts"" the clip the weapon is loaded and executing any other animation (Skill usage, going in/out cover and so on) will cancel the animation but the weapon will still be fully loaded.

You are a big target. A huge, scary target. You are so big that tiny chest high walls cannot contain your hugeness. Some enemy shots (Although not projectiles like missiles or Geth Prime's plasma bolts) will still hit you, but do negligible damage - They do, however, stop your shields from regenerating.

You have a lot of health, and it's important to keep it that way. Try not to waste health segments for small baby enemies - Your health is important in case your puny infiltrator ally got downed and you need pick him up.

Following the last point, when you have full shields and high health you can very easily pick up fallen teammates even in the middle of enemies and get away with it (As long as they are not right on top of the corpse and able to melee stun you).",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,True,,PC,True,t3_rcvbc,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/rcvbc/the_krogan_living_tank_krogan_sentinel_gold_guide/,
1375456503.0,54,self.MECoOp,1jkga9,Holy Fuck These Bastards are Scary...of the Week - The Reapers by soozafone,61,7,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1jkga9/holy_fuck_these_bastards_are_scaryof_the_week_the/,"&gt;**Lore of the Week: Reaper Ground Troops**
&gt;
&gt;This article was inspired by a recent playthrough of the Mass Effect campaign, which reminded me that the Reapers are fucking terrifying.
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;**HUSKS:** *stab, now you're a zombie*
&gt;
&gt;Indoctrination is a slow, subtle process, a manipulation over days or weeks with care taken to preserve higher functions. Becoming a husk is a different process. You find yourself on the wrong end of a [Dragon's Tooth](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon%27s_teeth) and you're already gone. The shock of initial impalement creates a surge of adrenaline, which only serves to carry the insidious nanomachines that soon transform you into a Reaper servant. You feel your flesh [wither](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmIIN6i1Cec&amp;t=58s) as cybernetics replace any tissue deemed nonessential. Mercifully, your consciousness fades, yet you retain some dim perception - a voice from infitely far away, infinitely powerful and persuasive. You care for nothing but what that voice asks of you. You are no longer human, you no longer have a past or a future. You are expendable.
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;CANNIBALS: *I'd give my right arm...*
&gt;
&gt;Cannibals are so corrupted, so mindless, that they have no problem devouring their fallen comrades on the spot just to gain some armor. But that's not the thing that scares me about them. Have you ever looked closely at a Cannibal? Obviously they're corrupted Batarians - their homeworld Khar'shan was the one of the first planets to fall to the Reaper harvest. But look up on the [shoulder](http://images.wikia.com/masseffect/images/2/24/Codex_Cannibal.png). That's a human head. To handle the recoil of that cannon, the right arm is [*an entire fucking human corpse*](http://i1120.photobucket.com/albums/l481/fusion_nl/Mass%20Effect%203/vulture.jpg). There's something severely disturbing about that. To the reapers, a human life is worth exactly one arm.
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;**MARAUDERS:** *we get it*
&gt;
&gt;I was trying to find an interesting, creepy tidbit about Marauders, but all I could find online was [Marauder Shields](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=467pmIX-oZo) jokes. I was going to make a forced metaphor about how we've been indoctrinated by internet memes, but eh. And much like Marauder Shields was treated as an anticlimactic boss fight, this section is also disappointing.
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;**BRUTES:** *like a terrible buddy cop movie*
&gt;
&gt;Brutes are cobbled together from bits of Turians and Krogans - the two most militaristic races in the known galaxy. That alone makes them a force to be reckoned with, but there's another factor. Turian tissue is dextro-protein based, while Krogans have levo-protein tissue. Without extensive regulatory implants, Brutes would be torn apart by their own body chemistry. Even in the absence of enemies, a Brute is always at war with itself. It's a pre-kicked beehive. If bees were capable of picking you up and spiking you like a football.
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;**RAVAGERS:** *the children's crusade*
&gt;
&gt;*A tone from space hushed one voice after another. It forced the singers to resonate with its own sour [yellow note](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IymgIxeRskw&amp;t=4m26s).* The Rachni were known for their advanced hive-mind consensus - the very thing that made them perfect thralls for the Reapers. Unlike the other species made into husks, the Rachni that become Ravagers were never meant for any other purpose. The Reapers have turned the last Rachni queen (or an artificial one, depending on your playthrough) into a breeder of ""hollow children, empty children that obey."" Ravagers are the Reapers' abused foster children, never allowed to aspire to anything beyond violence.
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;**BANSHEE:** [*we'll bang, okay?*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpeRk1YFn8s&amp;t=43s)
&gt;
&gt;We already know from Pants' [example post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1figac/mecoops_x_of_the_week_summers_almost_here_lets/caakoj3)  about the pants-shittitude  (Pants: hah, pants) of the Banshee, but I have something more to add. We know that Banshees are corrupted Asari with the (latent or active) Ardat-Yakshi gene. Now, remember: Ardat-Yakshi - which means Demon of the motherfucking Night Winds in an old Asari dialect - dominate their partners' nervous systems during mating, leading to [brain hemorrhage and death](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Ardat-Yakshi). Let me put that another way: they fuck you to death. Now look at a Banshee. Not only does it want to kill you, it wants to kill you by having sex with you.
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;We focus a lot here on the mechanics of gameplay, and I think we end up forgetting about the little things that gave us chills in single player. The Reapers are big on chills.


**(HEY LOOK GUYS I GOT A NOD FOR MY EXAMPLE POST :D)**

Personally I love reading stuff like this because it speaks to how the game impacts us on a personal level. I shit myself any time a banshee sneaks up on me, or I backpedal into a Praetorian.

1362211083.0,51,self.MECoOp,19ij2i,Zaeed's Legacy (AKA How to Make the Talon Amazing)(Build),62,11,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19ij2i/zaeeds_legacy_aka_how_to_make_the_talon/,"**INTRO**

So, people have been having some trouble with the Talon. He's gimmicky, he's horrible, he can't build strong without building squishy, etc. Well, you're all wrong. He's amazing, you just haven't been doing it right. Alright, you got the ""Cain Mines are awesome"" bit down, but you're missing a big piece. That's what I'm here for. The secret to this build is the wonkiness of his Omni-Bow combined with the awesomeness of the Kishock Harpoon Gun. I'm still not good at Cain Mine use, so I can't give you pro tips on that, but otherwise, the Talon Merc deserves, nay, **demands** your respect, and a second look. Here we go.

[**POWERS**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Engineer/TalonMercenary/KRALR/KishockHarpoon10AR5AQ5////OperativePackage5/)

* **Cain Mine**: Awesome, awesome power. Does insane damage and really lets you lock down and neutralize spawn points. One thing I've learned to do is make two sort of face each other so that they'll both be tripped at the same time, which can take out damn near anything. Spec full Damage and Armor Damage, because fuck subtlety.

* **Concussive Arrows**: Gives him great CC ability, and lets him debuff foes-- all around, a great ability. Spec Capacity/Chill/Capacity. This will stagger *anything* if you hit it with a charged Omni-Bow, with a total force of 2600N, and open it up with a 15% damage taken increase and 30% slow for 8 seconds, which is almost like a mini-Tac Scan. Use this on bosses, or use a spread shot to stagger a bunch of mooks at the same time. Awesome power, and it increases your Grenade Capacity-- well worth the point investment.

* **AP Arrows**: We're not using the Omni-Bow for damage, so don't take this.

* **Elite Merc**: If we're going to pay our respects to Zaeed, then we'll want Weapon Damage, which is what this build is focused around. 5 can go either way-- I take Power damage because I usually just go for bodyshots with the Kishock and it boosts Cain Mines, but if you feel like scoping in, more power to you.

* **Omni-Bow**: Despite how much we're going to be using the Omni-Bow here, just go full defense-- again, we're not using it for damage. Rather, we use the Omni Bow for utility-- see the Strategy section.

**WEAPONS**

Kishock all the way. Not even a choice on this one-- this build is built around using this bad boy for all it's worth. The synergy between this gun and this class is so insane that if it wasn't for the complete lack of anything like this build, I'd swear it's on purpose. Run damage and either scope, ammo capacity, or ULM-- your choice. Thank you to u/yumpsuit for reminding me that Explosive ammo is also fantastic on the Kishock, so if you've got shit tons of it in reserve, this is a great opportunity to use it.

A few good things to know about the ~~weirdness~~ awesomeness that is the Kishock (if I get any of this wrong, please correct me in the comments). It suffers no hipfire penalty, dealing full damage even when not zoomed in, unlike any other sniper rifle in the game, and has a uniquely low-magnification scope. This makes the best close-range sniper in the game. It can be charged to deal 1.75x its base damage, although because of the long charge time, when facing a large threat, it's more damaging to fire off shot after uncharged shot than to charge it up again for each shot. It is a projectile weapon, meaning that it has a travel time to hit its target but also suffers from no armor DR and is excellent at applying ammo effects, if you care about that. It also has a bleed effect, doing 60% of its damage upfront and the other 40% over the next 5 seconds. However, headshots, mods and consumable boosts only boost the upfront 60%. To offset this, it also has a Headshot modifier of 3x rather than 2.5x. Taking into account the bleed, it does 2.4x of its stated damage upfront on a headshot, and 2.6x after 5 seconds. It also ignores shield gates, meaning that it can easily one shot shielded health enemies without Phasic ammo. It's got a remarkably fast reload speed for a single-shot weapon, almost negating the need for reload cancelling. Lastly, it cannot pierce cover, but naturally pierces armor like that of Brutes, or Guardian shields. All of these things combine to make it one of the best guns in the game in my opinion-- a fully charged headshot is comparable to the Javelin in terms of damage, and ignores shield gate! It's crippled only by being very lag dependent, and this build can fix that. Read on for how.

**GEAR**

Operative Package will boost both Cain Mines and the Kishock, so I usually go with that. Consumables, do whatever you want. Power damage or Cycs are good choices.

**STRATEGY**

Now for the fun part. People always gripe about the Omni-Bow's terrible damage, and I'm not going to argue with them-- it's horrendously useless as a damage outputting tool. However, what they almost never talk about is its force component. On Gold, Vanilla-Bow can stagger Captain-level enemies, which means pretty much anything with Health that's not a Phantom, and with Concussive Arrows it can stagger **anything**-- Atlases,  Banshees, it doesn't give a guddamn. This opens him up for great synergy with headshot builds, as it's literally a free, zero-CD stagger. So, take the Supressor or Black Widow if you want, but if you want to be amazing, take the Kishock. Here's why.

Another feature of the Omni-Bow is that when you hold it charged on an enemy, the reticule will track their movement until a second or two after you fire. The Kishock is a chargeable weapon. When you combine these two facts, you get something amazing. As long as you're not too far away and not on horrific lag, you can charge up the Kishock, lock onto an enemy with your Omni-Bow, and either fire the Omni-Bow, stagger them, and then let go of the Kishock for a double whammy, OR, even better, just let go of the trigger on the Kishock while still locked on for an almost guaranteed bodyshot on an enemy. The Kishock suffers no hipfire penalty either, meaning you don't even have to zoom in!

In summation, you can use the Omni-Bow and Kishock in one of two ways. You can use them like a Batarian Soldier, with a scattershotted Omni-Bow acting as a CD-free PsuedoBallistic Blades, staggering enemies and then mowing them down with one of the most powerful guns in the game. This is a good bet if you're on high lag, since staggering enemies will compensate for the travel time of the Kishock projectile. The other way to play is by using the tracking of the Omni-Bow to snipe on easy mode, focusing on one enemy, staggering, and then instantly letting a Kishock bolt fly while letting the game track for you. It's difficult to describe, but if you try it, you'll get what I'm trying to say.

Lastly, just note that this build is helped immensely by hosting. It's not critical, it just expands your effective range a bit. If you can't don't worry, you'll just need to play a bit closer to the action.

**CONCLUSION**

The Juggernaut is not my style, and the Warlord isn't either-- I like mobility too much. EDIbot is good, but I also feel kind of dirty playing her. The other two I haven't unlocked yet, but I really want to. So, of the classes of Reckoning I've unlocked so far, the Talon is probably my favorite, and I hope this build makes you appreciate him the way I do. Don't forget to lay down Cain Mines, and just lock and shoot. Simple, but incredibly effective.",[Build],False,self,t5_2tkk1,1369883567.0,,Spectre,True,t3_19ij2i,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19ij2i/zaeeds_legacy_aka_how_to_make_the_talon/,

1338653103.0,55,self.MECoOp,uha0j,Tactical scan is a fantastic power.,60,5,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/uha0j/tactical_scan_is_a_fantastic_power/,"I really like team-based powers, Geth turret and Biotic Sphere are lovely abilities that can greatly help both you and your teammates.

I didn't really like the male Quarian at first, since it doesn't really have powers that compliment snipers as well as some of the other infiltrators, but since I am busy using *a certain sniper* I don't really have to rely on anything, not even aiming.

Tactical scan might not seem like the best power at first, it's basically a one-target hunter mode. But one thing you have to put in mind is that it buffs **all** damage done to the target by 15%, 25% if you spec it for damage and additional extra 7.5% damage on either weapon damage or power damage. This coupled with things like gear bonuses makes for some incredible damage.

Its obviously best on bosses where you need as much damage as possible. Your time will be better spent shooting the mooks rather then taking time to scan them, although phantoms are an exception seeing as this negates their cloak and makes them far more easier to keep track of (though again I don't think phantoms are considered mooks).

Though the **one big thing that makes tactical scan awesome**, is you are no longer just an N7 operative, you are now a N7 *commander*.

If there is one thing that will make any random drop everything he has to take on one target it is a big circle and a red outline. Seriously, this makes them more of a bullet magnet then a warped mook (I know this is hard to believe), this coupled with a couple of damage bonuses makes you able to prioritize targets *at your command*.
___________________________________________________________________________
**Protip:** You probably want to do the whole cloak &gt; power thing at first, but don't do this. This is incredibly effective I know, but not with tactical scan. Tactical scan has a incredibly low cooldown at only 1.33 seconds, using this power with cloak will actually *slow you down* rather then enhance your effectiveness. It also has a animation that renders you unable to shoot making you unable to get the cloak bonus. The only situation I'd recommend using it with cloak would be if you need to infiltrate an area by scanning the boss character then quickly get out of there, but otherwise don't.

**ProProtip:** If you stand in cover then use scan at a target you will not break cover, your character will simply do the animation in cover, very useful.
___________________________________________________________________________
If you need something done then a tactical scan will make get your fellow teammates get on the job. So if you haven't tried out the new Quarian yet then I'd recommend giving it a try, go make Kal'Reegar proud.

* Can be frozen by Asari's (Vanguard, Adept) Stasis ability.  Freeze and headshot away.   

* After two or three Stasis freezes, the phantom will become immune so do not use Stasis as a delaying tactic unless absolutely necessary;  freeze and kill.  

* To lure them in, duck behind cover.  If you are in the open, they will generally only break cover to shoot you at range and weaken your shield.   If you are in cover or if you have no shield/barrier up, they will run in to attempt melee attack or execution move.  If you have to do it solo, try to have walls or objects nearby that you can back-up/circle around while firing at them so you can avoid their SMG fire.

* If you are pinned and/or have multiple phantoms and no Stasis control, fire missile **AT THE GROUND** in their general vicinity.  The missile does cause collateral damage and will generally wipe out anything in a 3 - 5m radius.

**Engineer:** 

* The turret/backpack the engineer carries around will explode and usually take the engineer with it, if you focus fire on the backpack.  The only faster way to kill an engineer is headshots with a Widow.    

* Catch them when they are laying the turret, and they will be kneeling over, exposing the backpack even more.   Just remember to duck after the backpack/they explode, as the turret will pop up automatically even if the engineer is dead.

**Pyro:**  

* The tank on their back will explode if fired upon.   

* Obviously you can hit the tank from the back side easy enough; from the front, if you have armor-piercing weapon mod or weapon - aim left of center on their chest (near some tubes that port through the chest piece).   With tac cloak and a Widow, even a shielded Pyro can be blown apart in one shot if you hit it right.

**Rocket Trooper:**

* If you are real hot shit, you can actually shoot their missiles out of the air.  Yes, you too can be like John Malkovich in R.E.D., and shoot missiles in mid-air.   When taking them head on, just aim slightly down and to the left when the missile is first fired and it will boom.  

**Cannibals:**   

* There is usually more than one to a group; head-shot or otherwise kill the first one, and the others will hear the dinner bell and come running.   Use this opportunity to kill any nearby Marauders, then start picking off Cannibals one by one.   Unless you directly attack them, they will not get up from their feast until they are done and have the armor buff (which is not that strong anyway).


**Geth Prime:**  

* Quarian Infiltrator's Sabotage ability will mind-control the Geth Prime.  This can be effective if you are using it as a delaying tactic, just remember that the Sabotage will not last as long as the ability takes to refresh.  
* Headshots with a Widow or other high damage/armor piercing weapon are highly effective.   TacCloak Widow shot to the head on a Prime (on Gold difficulty) can take away nearly half their armor.

**Banshee:**  

* Go with a little Duke Nukem action.  Have your missile out and ready, let them teleport in range of you, finish the quote ""..and I'm all out of gum"" and missile the fekker point-blank.   Bask in the imaginary glory of how bad-ass you are.

* KroGuard motorboat - See **idiot_proof**'s comments below for details.

**Brute:**  

* Pretend you are a matador.  Get them to charge, side step it, and fill their ass-end with lead (or plasma-charged energy particles) while they are stunned and recovering.   Helps to do this in an area with some boxes/walls for maneuvering.

Now, some context.  I exclusively play this class on Gold.  It might work on Bronze and Silver, but morally speaking, you'll probably feel like a war criminal for inflicting such pain and suffering on your foes.  Although I typically score very high on Gold matches, this is the only class where I have LITERALLY gotten PMs from people asking me how the fuck I did that.  One guy asked me what I did to my claymore to make it so good.  I responded: I soaked it in skill for three days and tempered it in blood of newborn innocent Geth.  That's how.

**Build:**
Energy Drain spec'd for shield restoration/ synthetic enemies/ AOE.

Fitness: All shields baby.

STG: Weapon damage.

Tactical Cloaca: Damage, then the skill that lets you fire off a power without coming out of the tactical cloaca.
Proximity Mine: ain't got no time for this garbage, son.  

Edit- Apparently it's good!  Emergency87 suggests *""The SI is already tough enough with cloak and energy drain; imho, you should only invest up to three ranks in fitness. With the extra points,get the prox mine debuff that makes enemies take 20% more damage. On bosses energy drain is pretty useless anyways, and that 20% can really help, especially since the whole team benefits from it. Also, I've noticed that you can one-shot Ravagers if you apply the prox mine debuff first.""*

Claymore: (Mine is a measly Claymore III and works wonders) Smart choke and extra damage barrel

**(Optional) Equipment:** Incendiary ammo, Armor piercing ammo, Adrenaline module, Shield Amp, Shotgun rail amp.

Okay so here's what's up.  This class does best against Geth then Cerberus then Reapers.  Most of my strategy will be talking about the Geth.  Despite how many times you played them, they are going to be by far the most fun with this class.

Congrats!  You are now the most badass amphibian out there.  The sight of you in action will make a Krogan's quad ascend back up into their body.  Sorry, Brogans.

**Strategy:**
Get up close and personal.  Typically, the closer, the better.  However, once you get a feel for how much damage your boomstick does, you'll learn to kill enemies from mid range.
Tactical cloaca -&gt; run up to an enemy -&gt; energy drain -&gt; shotgun to the face.  Now back up while you reload, preferably walk behind cover (but no need to actually engage the cover i.e. pressing the action button next to it to hide).  Once you're done reloading, your cloaca ought to be recharged and you can throw that bad boy up and rinse/repeat.  This is a skin of your teeth kind of class: you will be taking fire constantly, but ending enemy lives in one shot.  
Yes, remember that: one shot.  Ideally you should kill every enemy in one shot on gold.  That is, with energy drain, you can easily ruin any enemy out there.  That brings us to...

**Enemies:**
Geth Hunter: If you have hated and feared Geth Hunters, take heart fellow Hunterphobe and remember, like any other organism your Salarian Shotgunner needs sustenance to survive.  And your shotgunner eats Geth Hunters and drinks the pained beep cries they yell when they die.  See, you have disguised yourself as the cowardly Salarian Infiltrator, the natural prey of the Hunter, in order to draw them in.  They come in close, and it turns out you shotgun them to the face killing them instantly.  You don't even need to tactical cloaca if you don't want to, but do it anyway just to make him feel the pain.  Or go out and hunt them down- they will be distracted with some decoy or non-cloaked buddies so they'll be easy pickins.  Get used to seeing +895, Kill a LOT.

Geth Pyros: They don't die in one shot, per se, but if you hit them right you'll see gouts of flame bursting forth from their packs.  See it?  Good.  Now laugh maniacally and walk away, ready to deal with harder enemies.

Geth Rocket Troopers: Easy peasy.  Cloaca-&gt; Energy Drain -&gt; Shotgun.  You can easily kill these guys at midrange.  Protip: since you'll almost never be in cover, if you move FORWARD and to the side a bit, you can dodge their rockets with ease.

Geth Primes: Get uncomfortably close to these guys and let rip.  Then run away.  Then repeat.  You want every pellet to land a headshot on these dude.  They should go down in around 3-4 hits.

Centurians: Easy, easy, easy.  Walk up and pop that melon with your shotgun.  Who invited Gallagher to this match?

Nemesis: Ah, you are JUST like a Geth Hunter now.  Cloaca, walk up to them, and take your time aiming at their faces.  You know the rest.

Phantom: Oh no!  It turns out you can pretty much one shot them as well.  Cloaca -&gt; Energy drain -&gt; shotgun to the head.  Getting close enough and getting a headshot is a nerve racking experience, but I've shot them from inches away and ended their miserable lives.  You can too!

Reapers: I haven't done enough testing against these guys on Gold.  Likely, it will be tough.  On Silver, you're probably good enough to just go to town.

So there you have it.  If I didn't mention the enemy, it's because normal strats likely apply.  Enjoy the extra hair on your chest you grow after getting in the middle of 4 pyros and 4 hunters and ruining all of them.*

After a lot of experimentation and observation, I would like to share what I've found:

**Biotic and tech powers actually go together quite well.**

I'll explain. I first got this idea while playing as a human sentinel against Reapers, and there was a salarian infiltrator on the team as well. A Brute shows up, and I of course commence spamming Warp and Throw at it. I quickly realized that at least half of my attempted combos were not detonating, and it didn't take long to figure out that the engineer was spamming Energy Drain at the Brute as well. I started to rage about him canceling my combos until I noticed that this would happen:

* I hit Brute with Warp to set up a combo. 
* He hits Brute with Energy Drain for reasons unknown.
* I attempt to detonate my combo with Throw, but am greeted by a burst of electricity instead (read: tech burst).
* I immediately hit the Brute with another Throw, and this time I get a biotic explosion. 

I was the only biotic on the team, so no one else could have set up that explosion. I began following the engineer and found that this happened every time the powers were applied in that order. It was extremely effective on Banshees as well, because Warp and Energy Drain are both effective against barriers. I'd warp, which would damage and decrease damage resistance on the barrier. His Energy Drain would then deal a hit to the barrier, followed by another big hit from the tech burst I detonate. Follow up with a biotic explosion, and the Banshee is feeling the hurt. Doing this combo on a Banshee a couple of times left it almost dead (Silver) and also killed a number of Marauders and Cannibals near it. 

Applying these same powers in a different order achieved similar results: ED first, then Warp -&gt; Tech Burst + BioExplosion setup, then Throw detonates the BE. 

When playing with different people, I found that Overload and Disruptor Ammo have the exact same effect as Energy Drain in this situation. Incinerate can detonate tech bursts, but it has no effect on biotic explosions. The only one I'm not sure of is Cryo Blast, but I think it doesn't interfere with BE's either. 

**tl;dr: tech powers don't cancel biotic combos, they just layer over them. If you go for a biotic explosion but get a tech burst instead, just hit it with your detonator again, and BA-BOOOM-WAAAAAH.**",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,True,,Xbox,True,t3_rxxnr,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/rxxnr/on_engineers_and_adepts/,

You've probably noticed the N7 Typhoon can penetrate cover and guardian shields by default (same penetration power as the Javelin) but another nice plus with the N7 Typhoon is that it also ignores 50% of enemy armor.

Which means it actually has AP mod by default, and AP modifications doesn't stack, putting on AP ammo or AP mod will only give you 10% more armor piercing (as it already ignores 50%, and the highest amount is 60%, but **only on the N7 Typhoon**), putting on Extended Barrel instead of AP mod will actually result in more damage against armored targets (and normal targets of course), same with AP ammo and Warp ammo.

**TL;DR** Never use any sort of armor piercing modification on this gun **ever**, as it has all these qualities by default and mods or ammo powers don't add to it. Just go with Extended Magazine and Extended Barrel for maximum destruction, and put on Warp ammo if you have it (or any other ammo power really, just not armor piercing ammo, save those up for shotguns)!

1342975267.0,54,self.MECoOp,wyynq,How to Platinum Guide,73,19,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/wyynq/how_to_platinum_guide/,"I'm very tired of seeing crappy builds on platinum. Here's a guide to Firebase White and Firebase Glacier, the most common platinum farming maps. I shall endeavor to make this guide and the builds as standard and idiot-proof as possible, in order to increase the number of successful wave 10 objectives completed. I should note that you should bring X level weapons to platinum as seeing lower leveled weapons, even on power based classes, makes me think you should be playing on a lower difficulty. 

**Classes**

There are a couple of classes that are both very easy to play, and greatly increase your chances of winning on platinum. If I see any of these classes while pubbing, I feel like my odds of succeeding on plat have increased significantly.

**Engineers**

**Salarian Engineer:** Decoy (duration/shock for tech bursts/shields) makes fighting geth significantly easier. Energy drain (damage/recharge/damage) is an excellent skill for both setting up tech bursts and maintaining your tankiness. Put decoy in front of the Firebase White chokepoint where the usual gold farming is done, the **Firebase Glacier chokepoint (which is the area where you find the Hanar Medigel Formula in singleplayer, the smallest room in glacier)**. Then, while equipped with any weapon that provides +200% cooldown, spam *nothing* but energy drain. This is essential as you will be setting up and detonating tech bursts for your entire team. This is a *very* easy class to play, but immensely helpful due to tech bursts/decoy.

**Geth Engineer:** This class is also good on platinum, as long as you specced the turret for (shields &amp; damage/restore range/restore frequency). Put drone behind your teammates, spam overload (chain/recharge/shield damage) for tech bursts. Cooldowns don't matter as much as long as you keep spamming overloads, so I suggest carrying a GPS with your hunter mode (accuracy/rate of fire/damage), and geth passive (weapon damage/power damage/weapon damage). Note that overloads are not for the damage, but for the tech bursts.

**N7 Demolisher:** A very good class on platinum, but requires more skill than the SE or GE to play. Put supply pylon (accuracy/power damage/extra grenade) behind your teammates, and stick near it. Recasting supply pylon resets its grenade stock, so carry only one weapon as cooldown matters. **Spam arc grenades** (damage/electrical damage/shield overload) over homing grenades (damage/fire damage/armor damage). This is because arc grenades have a much larger aoe, and will deal more damage overall along with setting up/detonating tech bursts. Homing grenades should be used the least of your grenade powers. Your passive (damage &amp; max grenades/power damage/power damage) will give your grenades maximum power. With a +5 grenade capacity gear, you should be set. Do not take max grenades at lvl 6 because having 11 grenades compared to 10 is not significant compared to +20% power damage bonus. The reason why the N7 demolisher is good is you can turn your thermal clip consumables into missile equivalents, making you essentially have 10 missiles altogether. **90% of the time you should be spamming arc grenades** for tech bursts, not homing grenades as they deal less dps overall. And **do not be afraid to use as many thermal clips as you can.**

**Infiltrators**

**Salarian Infiltrator:** Tactics have not changed (damage cloak, prox mine/energy drain, shoot weapon) so I won't go over this class, but I like seeing them on plat.

**Geth Infiltrator:** With hunter mode (accuracy/rate of fire/damage) the N7 Piranha becomes another superweapon with the GI. Tactics have not changed either, cloak/prox mine/spam weapon. You can melt single targets like the banshee very fast, especially if you use consumables.

**N7 Shadow:** **Spam Electric Slash.** This class I love to see on platinum, but many people do not spec it correctly, so I shall dedicate a lot of space to this guy. **If you spec the N7 Shadow for weapon damage or melee, you are doing it wrong.** The correct build is similar to the Cerberus vanguard/adept, and is focused on spamming electric slash, 6/6/6/5/3. The passive is (damage &amp; capacity/power damage) and three points in sword mastery for the move speed bonus. Electric Slash (damage/**100% tech burst detonate**/damage) is your spamming power. **Tac cloak (duration, melee damage/bonus power), is unlike every other infiltrator specced for support**. This allows you to do the activate four nodes objectives very easily while your team holds down the fort, or revive teammates without worrying about the five sec cloaks that most infiltrators have. The cycle is cloak/electric slash, cloak/electric slash, which allows you to spam electric slash at a steady rate (the first slash gets the tac cloak bonus damage, and the second slash happens right after you decloak manually, giving you the slash's short 1 sec cooldown to continue the cycle). Your shadow strike (damage protection/electric damage/shield drain) should almost never be used unless you're trying to kill a phantom that snuck behind you, or to be stylish on the last enemy on the map. Your tactic, like the Cerberus Vanguard/Adept, is to hide behind walls and shoot your electric slash through them, benefiting from the tac cloak +40% bonus damage, and triggering +100% damage tech bursts every 1.54 seconds. I repeat, **do not use weapons on this guy because the SI and the GI use weapons way better** than the N7 Shadow due to prox mine/hunter mode. **Melee damage is fun on silver, but is terrible on platinum.** With this build you can still have fun meleeing stuff on silver, but speccing for melee is simply overkill. Gear should be +power damage.

Honorable mention to QI, tac scan/arc grenades are good, but in general the prox mine from the SI/GI are better, and N7 Demolishers do grenades better.

**Soldiers**

**N7 Destroyer:** This is the only soldier class I like seeing on platinum, please do not use any other. Devastator Mode (Weapon Accuracy/Rate of Fire/Damage Bonus) is basically permanent adrenaline rush/marksman from the human/turian soldiers. Spec T5-V Battlesuit (weapon damage/power damage/weapon damage) and Multi-Frag Grenade (force &amp; damage/force &amp; damage/grenade count) like so. Currently the shoulder rocket launcher sucks, so I suggest max fitness, though that might change with patches. You're good with any weapon basically, but currently the N7 Piranha is the easiest to use. High level Typhoons and Harriers are good too. As long as you're good at shooting things, this class is not particularly skill demanding. If you're bad and shooting things, I suggest playing the power based classes (Salarian Engineer).

**Biotics**

Standard biotic tactics have not changed. However, I greatly prefer tech/weapon based classes to biotics as they have far more support options (prox mine, tac cloak, shield healing, decoys) compared to biotics, and mixing tech and biotics is less powerful than focusing on one. The mainstay Human Sentinel, Asari Adept, Drell Adept, Cerbeus Adept, Cerberus Vanguard, and Asari Justicar are all good to varying degrees. The new N7 Fury and the N7 Slayer are also good. However, as I said, I prefer seeing tech/weapon classes.

**N7 Fury:** Annihilation Field (Impact Radius/Damage Taken/Drain) is specced as such because 1. you want the +15% damage taken to affect as many things as possible 2. drain is better than more damage because it gives you survivability when you're surrounded by banshees, which happens very often 3. movement speed is not very good considering you have a teleport through walls dodge and is basically only superior when you yourself are carrying the pizza delivery objective and 4. speccing for damage isn't very good on plat, you're more interested in biotic explosions. Dark Channel (Damage/Recharge Speed/Damage) is the primer, Throw is standard (Radius to increase chances that the combo hits/Detonate/Force &amp; Damage). Your teleport dodge is amazing, use it to go up and down levels, and through walls. Don't forget to recast annihilation field. If you're bunkered down by any camping area, +15% damage to the enemies in front of the cover is great. Similar playstyle to Asari Justicar, but teleport dodge as I said is great, and you can detonate your own combos.

**N7 Slayer:** Biotic Slash (Damage/Detonate/Damage) is basically the most important power. Spam it to set off biotic explosions, it honestly doesn't matter how you spec the other stuff as long as you maximize power damage/recharge speed. Play like Cerberus Vanguard/Adept.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1342976583.0,,,True,t3_wyynq,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/wyynq/how_to_platinum_guide/,

Looking at the data, we see interesting connections. In general, the gameplay and overall scores are closely tied to the difficulty score. The easier the level, the more people enjoy it. Our telemetry supports this, showing that easier levels were played the most.

Firebase Glacier is a prime example. This popular level received average gameplay and overall scores, and it was also one of the easiest levels to complete. In was the fourth favorite map out of 19.

The exception is the Hazard version of Firebase Ghost (Acid Rain), which scored well overall but was also difficult. It had a much higher difficulty rating than Firebase Ghost, which might explain why the Hazard version is not played as much online as the normal version despite it receiving a strong popular vote.

**Map Comments**

We received a lot of great feedback on each level through this survey.  The next section summarizes the most common feedback for each level.

**Condor:**

Condor splits our fans into two groups. Some people loved the map, especially for its great atmosphere, and others didn’t enjoy the map at all. The feedback mentions issues with the slow ammo timer and with cover. The design of the map is open and allows for many lines of fire against the player, making the map difficult.

**Dagger (and Hazard Version)**

There are a lot of Dagger fans out there! Many of you liked the long ranges that made this a great sniping map, and it still had enough close ranged combat options to support every play style.

The map was a bit too open for some people, resulting in too much fire from too many directions. This issue was exacerbated in the Hazard (Sandstorm) version of the level. The sandstorm was a great visual event that hindered the player’s ability to see, but unfortunately it did not hinder the vision of the enemies. This was brought up as a big concern.   

**Ghost (and Hazard Version)**

Firebase Ghost was our second-most popular map due to its balanced gameplay for short- and long-range experts. People mostly enjoyed the cover layout in the level and the visuals of the Hazard version (Acid Rain).

This level’s biggest drawback was its extraction point being lower than the surrounding area and being light on cover. Players enjoyed the level overall, but the extraction point was a concern.

**Giant (and Hazard Version)**

Most comments on this level were positive. Overall, a lot of people thought this was a good, if not a great map. Giant was also considered easy—even too easy for some players. Its mix of open and closed areas with chokepoints and sniping opportunities were key positives.

There are mixed opinions on the extraction point. Some people found it easy, others hard. The key was controlling the chokepoints, but the player had no way out if they failed to do so.

Comments on Giant’s Hazard version (Night) focused on the improved visuals and atmosphere, but the consensus was that gameplay was less fun.

**Glacier (and Hazard Version)**

The most common comment on Glacier was that the map was too small. This tiny level is favored by close combat fans for its franticly fast pace. It’s quite easy to play so long as you maintain control of the area.

The Hazard version (Seeker Swarm) puts greater pressure on team coordination and map control. The seeker swarms made the map harder, and many players enjoyed the challenge. Others preferred the map without the addition.

And yes, Mordin did find a way to combat seeker swarms in ME2. Unfortunately, Mordin was not around to adapt his solution to the modification Cerberus made to this map’s swarms… 

**Goddess**

Goddess was seen as a pretty level with solid gameplay that kept you on your toes. The visuals were praised as one of the best of all the MP maps, and the gameplay was especially good for well-organized teams that liked to run and gun. The objectives were deemed difficult, though, as it was too easy to get surrounded.

**Hydra**

Hydra’s visuals received a lot of praise. (This made the artist very happy!)  Many players—especially snipers—liked the open style of the main area. Players noticed that difficulty was dependent on the enemy palette chosen. We received a lot of feedback on the extraction, with some wishing there were different locations and others wishing there was more cover or line-of-sight blockers in the current location.

**Jade**

Jade had something for every play style. Other than the extraction zone, where the cover was too light, the gameplay was received well. Other comments mention the importance of staying coordinated as a team to prevent getting surrounded. Jade’s visuals were praised as was the overall experience. It was considered a fun map.

**London**

The main comments on London were on cover and the open nature of the map. Players found a lack of cover in certain areas that made enemies difficult to deal with. This difficulty level generated a lot of comments, and the hack location in the middle of the map was particularly hard. Still, feedback was largely positive, with ammo distribution and the map’s visuals getting positive reviews.

**Reactor (and Hazard Version)**

Reactor generated a lot of discussion about the map’s enemies. The bug in which enemies got stuck was a sore point as was the layout and lighting, which made it hard to find enemies or anticipate their movement. Still, there were a lot of positive comments about good sniping opportunities and the balance of the map vs. each character class.

The Hazard version (Meltdown) was definitely more popular than the base version with players enjoying the interactive part of the map. Overall, players were split 50/50 on whether they had fun with their teammates or were simply scared of getting trapped inside by them. An earlier warning would have been desirable.

**Rio**

We received a lot of good feedback on Rio that we will account for in the future. This map was initially loved by players, but over time it became less popular. The “box of shame” bug was frequently called out as a negative. The layout was also somewhat controversial in that it encouraged specific play styles in different areas. This was seen as a negative when compared to maps that allowed a mix of play styles. Players enjoyed this map’s long ranges and that it emphasized teamwork. They found that working well together decreased the map’s difficulty, but they also found that small errors could quickly turn a sure victory into defeat.

**Vancouver**

This map is praised for how it plays with verticality more than any other level. While there was a good deal of positive feedback for this level, it was seen as a tad dull in some areas. Overall, though, it gave players a great experience and had a great skybox. The biggest issue mentioned was that the ladder in the middle of the map should not have been so heavily relied upon as a main thoroughfare.

**White (and Hazard Version)**

This map received the most positive feedback. Players overwhelming felt that the layout corrections were for the best. There were good discussions about how the map discouraged players from camping and from employing a single strategy for all the games in the level. The majority of players (past and present) enjoyed White for its gameplay and excellent visuals.

Comments on the Hazard version (Whiteout) focused on the unmanageable visibility that was caused by the overlaying effects of certain powers like Krogan Rage and Adrenaline Burst in combination with the snowstorm. The atmosphere created by the snowstorm was appreciated, but the problems held the map back in its fun rating.

**Conclusion**

As you can see, we got a lot out of this survey. It was a huge success and we want to end with thanking everyone for participating. This report is just the tip of the iceberg! We learned way more than what we specifically mentioned here. Your comments were informative and fun to read—we even got a haiku or two! This survey shows us just how much you care, and we will make sure to use all this valuable feedback in the future.

Thanks so much!

Tech Armour - 5 points (damage and radius, power damage whilst active)

No 6 points in tech armour as the 4th point in fitness gives more benefit.

*Note - He also uses Geth Scanner Gear Equipment

This less focused on the class build but to the strength of the tech armour as explained in the the last DLC of ME3 single player where a Turian Cabal has a conversation with a Salarian on how a Turian tackles all his enemies with a tech armour and a combination of Overload or Warp. 
The reason why this is awesome is because of how well tech armour actually lived up to the Turian's words and Xcal astonishes even himself that he still ranked on top of the leaderboard above an EDI infiltrator and a Typhoon Destroyer.  

A visual demonstration is most definitely needed here because its not something you would not believe by word of mouth and on conclusion I believe Tech Armour maybe the solution to all problems.

[Well, hey there little welps. Didja miss me?  Grab a seat by the fire.](http://i.imgur.com/fcCn9.png)  I won't bite.  We'll just have a chat, with some nice Ryncol on the rocks.  Can I offer you a snack? No? You sure?  Splendid. Let's get started. We have ***A LOT*** to cover since the last time.  Let's go over what I plan to cover:

* **We have some new weapons to go over**.  I plan to cover what *I feel* is needed to be covered. I could make a whole guide on every weapon available. @_@ I'd rather not. I hope you understand.  Leave a comment for any I won't be covering.

* **A new Faction**.  And holy crap, they're... Well, a doozy.  Even Krogan Veterans should be making dookie in their pantaloons. Actually...

* **New enemies for each original Faction**.  Some more annoying/harder than others.

* **New teammates and synergy**.  Well, classes.  And since I'll be going over a few Gold strategies, this will require teammates to work well (And communicate!) with.  But more on that later.

* **Gold gameplay and you**.  Added a section covering Gold (and applicable to beyond), and something I refer to as ""Decoy-Tank"".

* ***USER SUBMISSIONS WELCOME!*** I'd really like to emphasize the idea of this fireside chat.  I'll be giving full credit to anyone's submission in this thread to anything that contributes to the Murdertrain here in the appropriate section. So please, let's keep the content coming.

Before we continue, here's an updated ""build"" on what I've personally been using:

[**MURDERTRAIN**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Vanguard/KroganBattlemaster/RAQOP/NPiranha10AN5AO5//StrengthEnhancer3/CyclonicModulator4/JuggernautShield5/)

I swapped out the barrier buff in rank 4 for the extra 5% rather than the 30% Blast Buff since it got buffed in a patch/update.  I'd rather have even *some* more sturdiness.  Doesn't mean we won't pop barriers, but since we're now at where we were WITH taking rank 4 barrier pop buff PRE buff, I feel it's better to take the 5%. :shrug: YMMV.  It's really up to you for rank 4.

****
&gt;**Feur Frei!**

****

So with the recent updates, DLCs, etc, we've gotten some noteworthy weapons.  Here are the ones I prefer:

**The Reegar**:  I mention this first, because I know I'll get a thrashing if I don't.  It's powerful, fast, and relatively light.  But I don't like it for one reason; The range is terrible.  It stops dead in it's tracks after only a few feet (if that).  But, it's fantastic against barriers/shields, does great damage.  Chews through ammo though.  Only a 20 round capacity that gets eaten up quickly.

**The Piranha**:  If I'm not mistaken, the weight was increased not too long ago. ((Just checked, I can't find anything suggesting it was))  But this is my new favorite, probably over the Graal.  It's got more ammo (6) per clip, shoots fast, and is DEVASTATING up close.  Great for use with ""the Combo"" (Remember? Biotic Charge into Heavy Melee into Fire Shotgun+Shotgun+Shotgun until you can Charge again).  Even with the weight ""nerf"", it's still light enough to where I'd say it's worth it.

**Graal Spike Thrower**: We all know this is one of my personal favorites, and /u/Zelcron has brought some interesting things to light about it with some new EQ from the recent DLC.

&gt; It is a launch weapon, and therefore you can equip the shotgun omni blade for +50% melee damage with no effect on your cooldown, because as far as I know, the weapon mods that increase weight are still bugged.

&gt; It is a non-hitscan weapon. It therefore ignores armor penalties. One no longer needs to equip the shredder mod to be effective against armor.

&gt; It is both accurate and powerful, even though it is a shotgun. You don't need the shredder mod or the smart choke mod to make it useful at range or against armor.

&gt; Therefore, you can equip the omni-blade and either the mod for more damage, or more spare ammo, and you lose very little. In my games, I tend to favor more ammo except on Firebase Rio, because there is ammo everywhere. 

*Special thanks to Zelcron for the info.*



**AT-Raider/Claymore 2.0**: I say Claymore 2.0 because that's what it is.  A Claymore with 2 shots.  It's about as heavy as one, if not heavier, and hits for a little less per shot.  Worth mentioning, but I think you're better off with the other two or older shotguns.

**Acolyte**: Mentioning for it's uses.  Recently buffed and then nerfed.  It's now a ""charge me"" gun again.  I would say ""Yes"" to this gun, because it's so great at taking out Barriers/Shields (300% extra damage to the aforementioned). BUT that charge time leaves you out in the open. Even on Gold/Platinum, you're still gonna feel those hits waiting for a charge shot.  It's not a *long* charge time.  But if you feel it's worth it, take it.  You can slap ""Ultra Lightweight Materials"" on it, and not mess with your cooldown.  If you ask me, I feel Warp ammo is a little better with the Piranha.   But that's my personal preference.

While I'm at it, let me quickly mention something else that was added; GEAR.

I won't sit here and say what's ""THE BEST"".  Take what is best for you.  What I can recommend is the following:

* Berserker Package : Weapon Damage Bonus (Shotguns)/Melee Damage Bonus

* Stronghold Package : Shield Bonus

* Mental Focuser : Power Damage Bonus

* Structural Ergonomics : Power Recharge

* Multicapacitor : Shield Recharge Delay

* Shield Booster : Shield Bonus
* Shotgun Amp : Weapon Damage Bonus (Shotguns)
* Hydraulic Joints : Melee Damage Bonus
* Adaptive War Amp : Biotic Power Damage Bonus
* Juggernaut Shield : Melee Damage Bonus/Shield Bonus
* Martial Biotic Amp : Melee Damage Bonus/Biotic Power Damage Bonus
* Omni-Capacitors : Power Recharge / Power Damage Bonus

Also, take what you have.  I haven't even unlocked all of the gear available yet.

****

&gt; **I wanna Jitterbug...**

****

So, it's been a long time coming, and we've all been asking for them.

Now that they're ***HERE***... We don't know what we've gotten ourselves into.

Let me do my best by trying to go over what I've found to be successful so far.

**Abominations/Husks**: So these little bastards have a neat little trick up their sleeve.  They go boom.  One, or even two at a time, shouldn't be a big deal.  But if you're under fire, and then one or two (or more) slip past you and *then* go boom? Now it's a problem. Low on the threat level, but I'd still try to take them out sooner than later.  Especially if they start glowing.

**Collector Trooper**: Standard troop for Collectors. SMGs. Melee attacks, throws grenades. Annoying.  Step above a husk.  Not bad when it's just one or two. Bad in groups.  But you should be able to tank a couple.

**Collector Captain**: Your next step up from Trooper, and is comparable to a Marauder/Centurion.  These guys can melee you, but the thing you want to be worried about is they Swarms they throw at you. What's a Swarm? Glad you asked.

**Seeker Swarm**: This is going to **FUCK UP** your day. Why? Because it's going to ***KILL*** your cooldown. That's what the swarm does.  You're unable to use *any* power for a set period of time while the frakkin' thing is around you.  Which brings me to my next point...

**Possesion**: Harbinger will **ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL** of something, and make your day a lot worse.  The following is changed with the aformention:

* Abominations now have Barriers.

* Troopers now deploy Webs.  Webs just slow you down and get in your way. Just shoot them.

* Captains have twice as much health and deploy Seeker Plagues.

* A Seeker Plague has a Barrier.

Basically, they're more annoying.

Next up, our Big Daddies:

**Scion**: Remember this jack hole from ME2? Back.  Shoots a Geth Prime cannon now.  Packs a mean punch.  Will wreck your face with it.  He *can* insta-kill you, so I suggest ***not*** going into melee range unless you're using the ol' attacking from the rear strategy.  Has Armor. So no grabby-grabby.

* Possessed Scion have more armor (50%) and Barriers.  They also shoot grenades at you.  Oh, not just one.  CLUSTER GRENADES.

**Praetorian**: To put it lightly, these guys *SUCK*.  They attack from a distance, and can insta kill you.  They also float around in the air, making it difficult to get a good bead on them.  Oh, they attack at melee range too.  And fast.  So... Basically you're dealing with a flying Banshee who shoot freaking laser beams out of their freaking heads.  Team effort on this one.

*  Possessed version shoots missiles.  Stronger Barriers and Armor (50%)

... So that's fun, right? ಠ_ಠ
****

&gt; **No More Mr. Nice Guy**

****

So with the DLC that we got, we also received two more units for the Geth and Cerberus (one for each).

**Dragoon**:  They're joking, right? I mean, it's like bring a knife to a joust.  Yeah, it's another Vanguard... But you do it SO much better! Just charge, melee, shoot.  In that order. They just have armor, and have a LONG build up time.  They cover a lot of ground, but aren't much to worry about.  Remember the combo.

**Geth Bomber**:  These sneaky little bastards are stupid annoying (no sounds, since there's no sound files for them), and they drop bombs.  Oh, and they fly.  Charge, and shoot.  Trying to melee/heavy melee is gonna be tricky.  You'll miss a lot.

1348168982.0,53,self.MECoOp,107h0x,Why You Should Care For: The Crusader,57,4,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/107h0x/why_you_should_care_for_the_crusader/,"To celebrate an end to my internet troubles (Succinctly, I have a love-hate relationship with my ISP AT&amp;T), I am kicking off a new series dedicated to make you think twice about tossing guns into the **complete garbage** pile of weapons. The series will be organized by *why do people not like it*, followed by *why you should like it*, and ending with some *miscellaneous* information at the end. Now without further ado, let us start with the Crusader.
____________________________________________________

*Why does the Crusader get hate?*

**This isn't a gun, it's a brick. I mean, it really looks like a brick.**- Yes, this gun is exceptionally heavy. It should be the first thing anyone notices when using the Crusader. No one likes an exceptionally heavy weapon, especially when this weapon is somewhat difficult to wield, requiring another weapon if the user is not a God's gift to shooting.

**What is this, a shotgun for snipers? The spread needs to be at least THREE TIMES as big.**- As soon as the game is loaded, a user will notice that there is no spread. Quite counter-intuitive for those used the other shotguns shotguns, expecting a decent spread for close range. 

**The only thing you should feel when shooting, is the recoil.**- The main problem when using this a marksmen weapon is that there is a high amount of recoil when shooting. This tends to be a put off for those who want to use the Crusader as a marksman weapon.

**Their shields CAN hold firepower of that magnitude**- Lastly, because the Crusader shoots one slug instead of eight pellets, the Crusader is ineffective against shield-gating. Factoring in how many enemies have shields/barriers, it can get quite annoying to be constantly blocked by shield-gating. 

Now combine all these flaws with it being a N7 ultra-rare, and one can understand why it gets the ire from some users.
________________________________________________
*And why should the Crusader get some love?*

**BOOM! HEADSHOT!**- In between its amazing accuracy and high power per hit, the Crusader is very effective at cleaning heads off. Once one gets used to the recoil, it is quite efficient at slaying anything with a head. Phantoms spring to mind and honestly, who doesn't want to absolutely destroy Phantoms?

**Mowin 'em down, haha**- The Crusader shoots pretty fast and has a fast reload speed. This means one can shoot a lot of slugs down-field in a timely manner. This may not seem spectacular, but it is combined with the next advantage.

**I AM DESTROYER OF METAL MEN!**- Like the relationship between [ductility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductility) and [tensile strength](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensile_strength) in a material, there is a relationship between a weapon's ability to deal with shield-gating and armor mitigation. Because it only shoots one slug instead of eight like a normal shotgun, the Crusader is proficient at demolishing armor and I would consider it one of the best anti-armor weapons in the game. Coupled with its rate of fire, and the Crusader can ravage Ravagers and other boss enemies.

**I AM COMING FOR YOU!**- As an extra bonus, the Crusader starts out with a 50cm innate penetration bonus. This means its bullets can pierce through Guardian Shields, Reaper plating, and thin cover without losing damage potency. Quite useful ability indeed.
____________________________________________________
*Miscellaneous* 

**Don't equip the Shredder or Smart Choke mods**- The Crusader is already laser accurate, so the Choke mod just makes it look black. The Shredder mod will increase penetration, but the increased penetration is situational at best, and it decreases the damage when piercing, which is undesirable. Unless you focus on melee a lot, I just recommend the Spare Thermal Clip and High Caliber Barrel mods on all Crusaders. 

**Do put this gun on someone where weight won't be too much of an issue**- The main disadvantage of the Crusader is its weight. Once that is dealt with, the Crusader shines as a weapon. Consider placing it on a N7 Destroyer, N7 Demolisher, Krogan Sentinel, Vorcha Sentinel, or, if you are feeling a little gutsy, a Batarian or [Human Soldier](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/vo9s2/the_human_paladin_soldier_crusader_build/).
____________________________________________________

And that is why you should reconsider using the Crusader. Don't write it off as soon as you get it, try it out a little before putting a **Seal of Disapproval** on it.

Honestly, I don't know what weapons are really considered ""terrible"" in the current metagame, but I have a couple in mind. In particular, the Eagle, Geth Pulse Rifle, and Viper spring to mind as unpopular weapons. 

If people could put other weapons that could use some support in the comments, I would greatly appreciate it. If you like the idea of giving weapons a second chance, or loathe how I dare give one a second chance, let me know in the comments below.

1338429772.0,50,self.MECoOp,ud5do,Vorcha: Melee is the new Biotic Charge,57,7,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/ud5do/vorcha_melee_is_the_new_biotic_charge/,"If you've played the Vorcha you know that they're health regen ability Bloodlust is pretty much required to make up for their extremely small shield capacity.

You probably also know that Bloodlust specced for Health Regen bonuses is pretty awesome, and can lead to some impressive survivability under fire.

What you may not know, or may be underestimating (as I did), is how useful Melee is on the Vorcha. 


--------------------------------


If you're like me, you primarily use the Heavy Melee as a quick way to deal with trash and get your Bloodlust up, or perhaps as an opening to stumble things like Marauders and Hunters or interrupt Pyros long enough to run like your ass is on fire (alternately *because* it is on fire). Occassionally you use it to pummel bigger things, but not often, and its usually hit-and-run. 

However, I've recently discovered that it has considerably more utility than I originally gave it credit for, and I expect I'm not alone.

- In addition to high damage, long range, and high speed, **The Vorcha Heavy melee seems to grant Damage Resistance comparable to the legendary Batarian Heavy Melee.**

- More importantly, **Bloodlust's Health Regeneration functions as it normally does during the entirety of the animation, and it can outstrip many sources of damage with the help of the Damage Resistance.**

This means that it isn't just a way to deal damage and stumble [typically isolated] squishies and the like, but an effective way to ***regain*** *health while under fire*. Whenever you find yourself getting dangerously low on health, treat Heavy Melee like Biotic Charge: as a way to recover lost health when you start getting low.

The Vorcha play style seems to lend itself to highly aggressive and mobile combat (the evade is by far my favorite in ME at the moment), and I often find myself caught in the open or ambushed by CQC classes like Pyros and Phantoms. Whenever this happens, I've found that alternating use of the Flamer and the Heavy Melee to be very effective, with the Heavy Melee being used to break shields and keep you standing.

--------------------------

*This has only been actively tested on Silver at the moment,* but it just allowed me to survive the latter halves of waves 8 and 9 against Geth without any teammates. At one point I was jumping between 3 Pyros, and the HM Damage Resistance kept me alive through multiple jets of flame. I was worried about the Vorcha's viability on Gold (especially vs. Geth, which seem well-equipped to counter him with hordes of Pyros and Hunters), but taking advantage of this damage resistance has made such a big difference that I'm beginning to think the Vorcha could be quite useful on Gold. (I certainly hope so)

------------------------------

**TL;DR: The Vorcha's Heavy Melee seems to offer a lot of Damage Resistance, but Bloodlust's Health Regen continues to work at the same pace. Using Heavy Melee when you start getting low on health means that you can regain large amounts of health, even in the face of high-damage onslaughts like Pyro's Flamethrowers.**",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1338430109.0,,Xbox,True,t3_ud5do,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/ud5do/vorcha_melee_is_the_new_biotic_charge/,

**Cerberus Adept**

The Cerberus adept to me seems very different than previous uses of the class. This character needs to be up close and personal for its primary power (smash) to be utilized. The leash power is fun, and can be specced for great biotic explosion potential. I suspect the powers of this class are better suited for the Vanguard version. I like the melee a lot, both the light and heavy. The light melee has the character pull out the stun batons that we know so well from other Cerberus fighters, while the heavy melee involves sweeping in a circle around the adept.

**Vorcha Sentinel**

Another change up on what I'm used to, the Vorcha seem to be suited for close range combat. Bloodlust is a lot of fun, and leaping to and fro makes for very fast movement speed. I would recommend setting bloodlust for health regeneration. Vorcha have very little health, but I hardly ever went down thanks to the constant regeneration. Flamer makes me feel like a Geth Pyro. It is excellent against armor and health, but average against shields. An unshielded enemy will stagger and freak out from the flames, however. Cluster grenades are welcome, if unexpected, and they're useful if one has accidentally overextended. This seems like a front line fighter in my book.

**Male Quarian Infiltrator** 

I love this character. This to me is set to be a wonderful sniper. The Tactical scan paired with cloak makes for a good combination, allowing the whole team to see nearby enemies while pinning a specific foe down with damage increase. Arc grenade is very useful, it has such a great range to it that it can be used for almost anything. 

**Krysea Sniper Rifle**

I'm not sure how I feel about this yet. The vaunted zooming sniper scope didn't help me very much, and it required a pressing of the fire button to zoom in. When I thought I would be firing I found myself getting closer to the enemy. I'm very curious to see if damage is reduced for this gun when not zoomed in like other sniper rifles, because I found myself hip firing pretty effectively. Watching it turn enemies into gibblets is very fun.

**Firebase Goddess**

There is no way you're going to be standing still on this map. It makes me think of Reactor in this respect; there's not a great place to bunker down. The higher elevation is nice for firing down at enemies, and useful for when the group needs to heal up. This seems to be a mid-sized map, but there's always a place to move to.

**Firebase Jade**

This is one of my new favorite maps. While there isn't a spot in it like the basement for White, there are several places a group could take cover and hold out if necessary. The bridge at the top of the map serves as excellent temporary sniping grounds, and there are plenty of places to take cover. Annoying though is the fact that many of the desks cannot be vaulted over. I died several times because I was trying to escape, only to find I couldn't go that way. 

**Gear Slot**

This feature seems like it will be incredibly useful. I had expected it to remain in the slot chosen after the match, but it unequipped itself. This isn't a problem, just a little unexpected. I can't wait to get more of these. ",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,Xbox,True,t3_uavi7,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/uavi7/initial_thoughts_on_rebellion/,

[Here is a sweet diagram I made in MS paint of Firebase White.](http://i.imgur.com/8yQSL.png)

It is not to scale.

*    Red boxes are ammo
*    Green boxes and lines are cover
*    Yellow lines are ladders
*    Blue boxes are spawn points of the hack something and defending it
*    Numbers will be zones I refer to

**What this works best against:**

I have personally had the easiest time with this strategy against Gold geth. I normally play a quarian infiltrator, so that makes it even easier, but you do not need one. A good team can use this spot with any classes as long as they are level 15 or higher. Don't try to use this spot if you are low level and/or don't have some good guns.

It is also doable with Gold Cerberus, but Phantoms can be tricky to deal with. The best bet to do if you are going for gold Cerberus is to have an asari adept or asari vanguard with Stasis bubble.

If you use this spot on silver, I can guarantee you a win in most cases.

**What not to do:**

In most pugs I do on this map, the average group immediately runs straight to zone 2. This is probably the WORST spot on the map to try and defend. Enemies can come at you from 3 sides. They will spawn in at zone 1, 5, and 3. The only cover you have will not protect you from every direction, and the ladder makes it easy for things to get into melee range.

**What to do:**

The second the game starts, you want to run your group to zones 4, 5, and 6. With these 3 zones, nothing can spawn behind you and they will only come at you from one direction. Zone 4 and to the right of zone 5 will be the main kill areas. Enemies will spawn in zones 3, 7, 2, and 1. This means they will all funnel into areas for you to lay into them with biotics and tech attacks.

**Where to position yourself and your team:**

You basically want to have two people in zone 5 and two people in the L shaped cover at zone 4. Zone 4 will probably see the most action, but you can see the enemies from the cover by zone 5. If you are a sniper you can stand in zone 6 and have a clear line of sight on parts of 4 and the stairs leading to zone 5. Zone 4 is a good spot to get grab kills too. Zone 3 is a very good spot to but the lack of an easy to get to ammo box makes it less than ideal.

**What to do when you have to hack the 4 nodes:**

If you have an infiltrator, you want to have the rest of your team get the attention of the enemies and have the infiltrator stealth around to the nodes. Do not follow the infiltrator. This will just cause enemies to come at him while he is trying to get to a node. If a node spawns near you and you are clear to get it, grab it.

If you don't have an infiltrator, you want to move in a group, but don't move too fast. Running straight for the node without stealth is a good way to get yourself killed. Move slowly and take alternate routes if a pack of enemies spawns between you and a node.

Thanks for reading and I hope this helps! A gold run is 75,000~ credits. That is a spectre pack + some every 20 to 30 minutes. My fastest gold geth is 22 minutes.

Keeper of the Builds

Edit: InterwebNinja posted a comment basically emulating all my thoughts about putting this together:
&gt;It's true, player skill does affect the effectiveness of many builds. Some are harder to use than others, some are more survivable than others, etc. But since the ratings are meant to be relative to the class, and not overall, that issue evens itself out somewhat. Within any given class, most builds tend to play similarly, so then it just comes down to some specific evolution choices and the like. There are obviously exceptions, and at some point, people just need to read the builds and judge for themselves.  

&gt;Anyway, I think the goal of the system was to make it easier for those with less experience to sort through the large volume of data. Some people just want to know ""what works"", and the number at least represents our opinion about what the upside of a given build is (again, relative to its class).  

&gt;But yes, I agree it's of limited value, overall. Ultimately, people just have to play the class themselves and decide what works.",[Official],False,self,t5_2tkk1,1363819273.0,,,True,t3_1ankqz,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1ankqz/bblob_super_mega_awesome_update/,

I've revamped the list and the description for most guns to reflect it. Please feel free to comment if you still don't agree. 

This time around I'll be doing heavy pistols and will also be revising a few things in regards to how I put these together.

**Rating Categories**

I figured I'd adjust these slightly since they didn't make sense in certain ways, through comments and my own thoughts.

Damage will stay mostly the same as a category as it's fairly straightforward. However, I will be looking at stuff like DR and built-in multipliers here directly instead of in flexibility.

Usability is also mostly the same, but will be renamed Handling. Whether or not a gun is sustain fired, the amount of recoil on the gun, and the accuracy are evaluated here. I've decided not to include rarity since it didn't really make sense to include in how a gun directly handled. However, ammo capacity will be considered here.

Lastly, Flexibility/Utility has been changed to just Utility. The category now looks at the weight of the gun, which should reflect which classes it works well with, how well it applies ammo powers, and any additional utility effects it has (such as falcon stagger).

**New Sections**

Since pretty much every Flex/Util section included usage tips, common mods, and class synergy, there will a new section called Usage.

Furthermore, I will be including an overall blurb to describe the weapon class in general.

As usual, I will be making justifications for each gun in the comments. Please leave you remarks, arguments, or other thoughts on the relevant gun.

**PLATINUM**
Paladin, Acolyte, Scorpion, Talon

**GOLD**
Arc Pistol, Carnifex 

**SILVER**

**WEAPONS OVERVIEW**

Heavy pistols are lightweight powerhouses. Stuff like the Carnifex and Paladin once ruled the game as the best weapons for just about any class. They've since given that title away due to new weapons being released and the buff/nerf cycle, but both, along the rest of the weapon class remain versatile and powerful.

In general, HPs are a great fit on just about any class. Casters will enjoy the power they bring while still keeping their cooldowns low. The general high accuracy and damage on these guns can make anyone a specialist in lobotomy. High damage and accurate burst weapons also generally fare better on higher difficulties because of the reduced effect of amour DR on overall DPS and less exposure.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1356676212.0,,,True,t3_15itgc,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/15itgc/weapons_tier_list_heavy_pistols/,

Operation Lodestar is my favorite operation in a long, long time. In my opinion this is what challenges were supposed to be like instead of the random ""do one bronze solo with whatever stupid weapon/character we picked this week"". Instead this challenge is an actual challenge. 

It forces people who don't usually play platinum (which judging by the recent info-graphic is just about everyone) to actually challenge themselves and step up their game.

Now, I personally play a lot of unknown/unknown platinum, so unless the RNG decided to freak out on me I would have gotten this challenge just by playing normally. Instead I decided to make a real challenge out of it. I'm going to do four plat solos, one against each faction.

**Geth**
---

I always like getting the worst part out of the way first, so I decided to do geth first. And because geth are cheating fuckers I decided to ultra-cheese them with the [Alliance Infiltration Unit](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/AllianceInfiltrationUnit/PRJND/ReegarCarbine10BH5AL5//ShotgunRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator4/GrenadeCapacity5/).

There really isn't much to say about it, cloak with shotgun bonus, snap freeze, invincibility, speed, amazing dodge, shield-regen and reegar. What could possibly go wrong?

...

Here are the [Results](http://imgur.com/a/lXGVr#0)

This went about the way I expected. The only waves I had some trouble on were wave 2 (fucking triple primes) and 9, as well as the clean-up on wave 10. 

The AIU is just as powerful in a solo as I expected it/her/whatever to be. The geth-staggers are still dangerous and reegar range isn't always the safest place to be, so positioning is important for playing geth with her. Still, the incredibly damage output more than makes up for it. 

And even if you mess up, you just get back up again... So yeah, if you want to start doing some solos, this is the class to go with. Krogan vanguard or ghost are just as easy, but I feel that the AIU will at least teach you some manner of good positioning and reasonable play by showing you when you would have died with a ""normal"" class, instead of just being flat-out invincible like the ghost and the kroguard. 

Objectives were circle hack, circle hack and kill targets, the hacks both went smoothly, and I still had 4 missiles for wave 10, so that was pretty chill as well. 

To my surprise I only died three times (I think). I like telling myself I could have also done this with the geth or the drell, but to be honest, geth fucking suck and they fully deserve anything I can throw at them. 

It was also the first time I didn't use consumables except missiles. Who needs medi-gel and ops-packs if you are invincible?

No video for this one, as it wasn't very exciting. Lots of running around, lots of reegar-ing and lots of waiting for primes to get into a position where I can kill them without getting murdered by one of their fifteen pets. 

Also for some reason I always have weird framerate issues if I record on white. Most of the time it sticks at 60 as usual, but at some points in a game it randomly drops to 30-40 for a couple of seconds which is very annoying. 

I'll probably not make a separate post about this build, but I'll see once kojak updates the bblob. If all the other AIU builds are questionable I'll do a quick post. 

The only thing that kind of goes against the usual build is dropping the last rank of snap freeze for three points in fitness. It's not a big deal either way but the last rank of snap freeze is pretty useless and the fitness might occasionally help a little bit every now and again. 

I also went with comfort over damage by taking the shotgun spare ammo and grenade cpapacity. They really aren't necessary, but they save me from running around even more. 

So yeah, the AIU is pretty damn good, the reegar is as ridiculous as ever and combined they are as broken as things get in this game. On the other hand, I don't really feel that the AIU needs a big nerf, just some tweaks to make repair matrix less spammable and maybe reduce the shield-regen a little. 

Bonus: [AIU gold.](http://imgur.com/a/IqorW) I felt I had to get one of these in before they nerf it. 24min isn't bad for white and I was too much of a pussy to do glacier (against cerberus). With better objectives and less miserable missiles I could probably get it done two or three minutes quicker, even on white. 

Not as quick as krogan vanguard though.

**Reapers (a)**
---

Next up, reapers. I've done several solos against them already and to to be honest, they are baby-play compared to the other factions (I'm joking. They are slightly easier, that's it.) 

So I decided to get a little playful and bring out one of the true overpowered classes in this game, the [mighty and feared female quarian engineer.](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Engineer/Quarian/AKRRR/CerberusHarrier10AD5AF5/Acolyte10BK5BA5/AssaultRifleRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator4/ArmoredCompartments5/).  
I went [all out with the weapons](http://i.imgur.com/reEKyUw.jpg) for this one though, the class is handicap enough.  

I don't think I've ever actually played this class on platinum before, but she used to be one of my favorites when I first started playing mecoop. It's long past time I gave her another go. 

Cryo blast is one of the absolute best powers in this game (along with proximity mine), and it works beautifully with incinerate. The small stuff is easily killed with acolyte + fire/cryo explosions, against bosses the cryo blast debuff as well as the incinerate freeze combo work wonders. 

...

[Fuck this stupid fucking game](http://imgur.com/a/7sdCe#0). I was so pissed after that one. 

Until that point, the game had gone almost too smooth to believe. I was perfectly aware that the the FQE is a very good class if you play her well, but I did not expect her to work out this well in a platinum solo. 

I died the first time on wave 8, which might be the most waves I've ever gone on a plat solo without dying, so I was very impressed with myself.

The sync-kill in the end was absurdly unlucky. I was trapped in a bad spot with banshees and phantoms coming from the control room on the right and the atlas standing on the left, so I decided to run past the atlas. 

Didn't work out so well and I died. I immediately popped medi-gel because I didn't want the banshees to reach me and of course I immediately got grabbed by the atlas. 

I watched the recording of it and unfortunately the atlas had meleed me while I had my back turned, it was almost impossible to see. Very unlucky. 

And now after adding the links to loadout and build I realize that I'm a complete fucking moron and didn't have armor-piercing on the harrier. Fuck. So *that's* why banshees took so long to kill. 

This isn't even the first time I've messed this up. I once did a destroyer gold solo with an armor-piercing less PPR. I somehow still managed to win that one though. 

Retrying the same thing again right away is always frustrating to me, so I decided to do collectors before giving reapers another go. 

---

**Collectors**
---

I had originally planned to do a typhoon turian soldier against collectors (shamelessly copying aaron), but after the FQE failure and the single player sucking up much more of my time than I had expected, I decided to make my life a little easier and do it with [the geth infiltrator](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/Geth/FIQNJ/ParticleRifle10AD5AF5/GPSG10AO5AL5/AssaultRifleRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator4/ArmoredCompartments5/) instead. 

For variety's sake I decided to go with a bit of a wonky weapon setup, geth plasma shotgun and particle rifle. GPS for the small stuff, PPR for the bosses. 

...

[Here is the result.](http://imgur.com/a/2HG1s#0)

Worked out pretty decently, but collectors were a bit tougher with this class than they were with the krogan shaman. I died three times, two times on wave 5 (?; the one with all the pyros) and once on extraction wave. 

Objectives were pizza, circle hack and kill targets. Pizza was easy as ever, circle went smooth-ish-ly and I had armored compartments, so kill targets was just missile spam. 

62mins is an okay time in my book. I lost a lot of time on the wave with the three scions, took me forever to untangle those, the rest went pretty damn well. 

I've already done a post about the [geth infiltrator here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16vo2n/unnecessarily_long_guide_the_higher_being_geth/), so I don't need to explain much about the build, but I think the weapon choices are quite interesting. 

First the geth plasma shotgun is simply an excellent solo weapon, it makes phantoms and abominations very easy to deal with and packs enough of a punch to kill most normal guys in one or two shots at any range. The fact that it is a charge weapon is a huge plus, especially for a solo, as it means that you can shoot while running, while staggered (incredibly helpful against hunters), and you can shoot it without breaking cloak. 

The particle rifle is purely there as an anti-boss weapon and in my opinion it is the very best anti-boss weapon in the game (well, along with the reegar). It also synergizes reasonably well with the geth, the cloak and proximity mine timings work out pretty well. 

I didn't record this one either because I already have a [GI plat solo vid here](http://youtu.be/dszdBo08R2g). The other reason is that hunter mode and recording together are a bit hard on my pc. I don't like playing at less than 60fps (yes I know, spoiled pc player...) so I would have had to lower graphics settings which I didn't want to do because I'm lazy. 

I'm very happy collectors worked out on the first attempt especially after the FQE drama. Anyways, two more solos in 30 more hours, should be doable, unless I have another really frustrating failure. 

---

**Reapers (b)**
---

So, here we go again. This time with armor-piercing. I still can't believe I fucked that up. (I also can't believe that the first attempt went as well as it did, considering the no armor-piercing). 

If I fail again, I'll probably switch to a more reasonable class, but it would be pretty damn cool if I could manage this with the FQE. 

...

[YES! I actually did it. Plat solo with a female quarian engineer.](http://imgur.com/a/WWQ8a) 

[Here is the video.](http://youtu.be/QtEbKQVjKS4)

Wow, I'm so pumped this worked out. The game overall went insanely well again, but I got pretty hard objectives this time. Wave 3 was pizza again, so that was easy, but on 6 I got 1234s and one of them was in the really bad spot ahead of the LZ to the left (where the entire map can shoot you). Died once and had to use a missiles to get that one done. 

After that it was smooth sailing again until wave 10 where I got a drone objective, the really bad one that goes from the very far end of the map to the LZ. That was quite a pain and I had to use missiles and ops-packs to get through.

I also messed up extraction really badly and was very lucky that I got extracted. I died in the LZ with only three seconds left, but thankfully I was able to pop medi-gel quick enough. 

I recorded this one, so definitely expect a post/guide on the FQE later this week along with the video. 

And to be honest, the power of this class kind of took me my surprise. Like, I knew she was decent, definitely not as bad as some people make her out to be and I'm a huge fan of cryo blast but I just didn't expect to do this well with her. For comparison, this only took about 6 minutes longer than my huntress solo with the same weapons. 

Only one more left to go now and still about 25 hours left. I might do the justicar or the asari vanguard against cerberus, but I'm not 100% on that yet. 

Also depends on when I have time to play, if things get tight with the end of the challenge I might just cheese it with the AIU or the kroguard. 

---

**Cerberus**
---

I decided on [the justicar](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Adept/AsariJusticar/RPQFF/CerberusHarrier10AD5AF5/Acolyte10BA5BK5/AssaultRifleRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator4/ArmoredCompartments5/). Cerberus is in my opinion the hardest faction to solo after the geth and I wanted a rock solid class for this one. 

The justicar is incredibly versatile with great mook and phantom killing abilities thanks to acolyte+pull+reave, but also infiltrator levels of damage against bosses thanks to the bubble debuff and warp ammo bonus damage. 

Seriously, people, play this class, she is amazing and she is amazing to have as a teammate. 

...

[And here are the results.](http://imgur.com/a/Ol0eY#1)

[Here's the video.](http://youtu.be/35dpEw3EnLE)

Yeah, that's right, I died in literally the last possible second... Unfortunately while this counts as ""Mission successful"", it doesn't count as an extraction for the challenge. Stupid game. 

This is in my opinion the most well played platinum solo I've done. 49min is an amazing time in my book. I've only done two quicker ones, and both of those were with the reegar (+kroguard and +AIU). So I'm extremely happy to get below 50mins with a ""not op"" class. 

I had some huge trouble with dragoons, especially on waves 9 and 11. The justicar has a bit of a weak spot against them because pull doesn't work and reave+bubble isn't strong enough to kill them in one go. And switching to the harrier is always a risk, because it leaves you vulnerable to hunters and phantoms. 

I'm also absolutely not redoing this because of one stupid second. I count this as a win and I'll just complete the actual challenge in a team game. 

I have a recording of this game as well, but I've already done a [justicar post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/135rvh/guide_the_bubble_strikes_back_asari_justicar/) (with more info than you ever wanted to have), though it might be time for a little update. Not sure if I'll just edit the old post or make a new one. Probably new one.

I was burning through some challenges as a Krogan. I was playing with a kid that wasn't playing well at all, and was being verbally assaulted by 2 other kids(neither of which were playing well either).

This kid was really young and seemed like he was afraid. The other kids had slightly-deeper voices and were harassing this poor kid while trying to kiss my ass for carrying them. I put my mic in after a few rounds and just pretended to be a Krogan and yell at this kid, in a positive way. I gave random soundbites like ""FOR TUCHANKA"" and heavy-melee spree to get a rage bonus and yell ""AHAHAHHAHAHA!""

I told this kid to give me his ""War Cry."" He yelled into his mic and it was so damn adorable. The rest of the match I role-played a Krogan and did my best to protect this kid's character. We were on Vancouver, and he was so lost trying to recover the object to extraction, and didn't know how to drop it. It was so fulfilling and a change of pace with PUGs. I told this kid where to go and intercepted mooks for him left and right, each time yelling into my mic like a Krogan. We managed to finish and during extraction, the 2 little shits that were picking on him both got sync-killed and I gave no effort into saving them. This kid and I extracted, I had to help him a lot.

I didn't hear anything from any of them once we finished, and they all left. It was fun though, I don't know anything about that kid, but it was a little rewarding to think I might've helped him feel better and have a more enriching MeCoOp experience.

I received some positive feedback after I spoke about that time, and some PMs about ""why isn't this a thing omg?"" and ""I'm totally doing this from now on.""

Since then I've made it a habit to inject a little ""role-play"" when I play. I've since finished most of the challenges, so I'm ""free"" to play what I want. I mostly play my Geth Engineer ""GethToSmoochy."" It's fun to speak like a Geth on my mic, ""cover this one,"" ""this one is appreciative,"" ""this one requires assistance to complete the objective""(for lazy pugs that don't bother with objective phases).

I've tried to RP different characters, but I'm not very good at changing my voice. I'm only good at Geth/Krogan characters, once in awhile I'll attempt to mimic an Asari and can hit it every once in awhile.

Brain dump follows:

As you know, the maximum number of times you can use these things in a match is two, but you can expand your capacity to five\* with gold cards from the store. The limit was originally 10. People who had more than five before the limit was reduced were allowed to keep them. 

**COBRA MISSILES**.

* According to my interpretation of the variable names in coalesced.ini (found at bioweapon.ini\sfxgamempcontent\sfxweapon\heavy\consumable\rocketlauncher), the cobra instantly kills enemies within 2m of its contact point (there's a variable 'gibrange' set to '200f'). There's a continuum of damage from 50,000 points (enough to kill everything but a platinum atlas) which gradually decreases to nothing at 7.5m from the impact.
* The missiles also hit through walls.
* Since the weapon appears to have an actual damage value, we can surmise that abilities like tactical cloak and adrenaline rush can make your missiles more deadly.
* Allies, swarmers and husks can block the missiles, so aim carefully. In the open, it's often a good idea to aim at the floor so that missiles don't sail off into the wild blue yonder.
* On non-objective waves, it may be a good idea to nuke spawns if you feel your team is not up to scratch. Reaper spawns take up a lot of space, so it may be an idea to aim for a wall off to the side so that you catch them all.
* On objective waves: with hacks on gold, leave nuking banshees and primes to the last possible moment. I think it's best to nuke the hack zone just before it becomes overrun. Doing it too early means that the bosses simply respawn and you're using a rocket every 15 seconds rather than every 30. On VIP assassination waves: consider using a missile to kill the target. As a bonus, if you kill, say, a VIP atlas and a guardian, the next target will often be a guardian rather than an atlas.
* Remember that on objective waves, you gain far more money by using a missile to make sure you clear the objective, than by being stingy. Failing a wave 10 objective on gold costs you 30-odd grand, roughly the cost of a jumbo equipment pack and worth far more to you than one measly missile.
* It's a good idea to switch to your missile launcher as soon as the thought ""oh shit!"" has entered your head. Those times your team is stuck in a cycle of being killed and revived? That time your on wave 9 and pinned by two banshees? When you see three phantoms over the corpse of the guy you came to revive? All good times to use a nuke.

**OPS SURVIVAL**

* Often people use ops survival packs and complain that they were taken down moments later. While this is sometimes due to lag, there is another reason. Froghorn explains [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/xqbvz/updated_and_comprehensive_list_of_bugs_and_broken/c5owt70). (Essentially, you have a shield gate just like enemies do. A single piece of damage (ravager blast, atlas rocket, marauder bullet etc) which completely depletes your shields won't pass through and damage your health. After your shields blow, you get total immunity to damage for a short time - 0.5/0.25/0.1/0.01 seconds depending on your difficulty level. After this, even if your shields are restored, your shield-gate *won't* block large amounts of damage for 1.5 seconds).
* It's a good idea to remap the key for the ops pack to something you can reach in a panic (I've got mine on 'Q').
* In coalesced.ini, (in biogame.ini\sfxgamempcontent\sfxpowercustomactionmp\consumable\shield), it suggests that using an ops survival pack grants you 1000 bonus shields for 20 seconds.

**MEDIGEL &amp; REVIVES**

* When you're revived, you get a small amount of damage reduction: 75%/50%/25%/10% for 2.5 seconds.
* Users on the PC often remap the medigel key to something convenient (like 'E') so that they can reload cancel - social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/11033675/1 better.
* People seem to have fewer medigel than other consumables. IMO this is an indication that they (and I include myself here) should be using other consumables like ops survival packs and cobras more. It's pointless hoarding those - you're going to have to buy a jumbo equipment pack when you run out of medigel, and those give you as many missiles and ops packs as they do medigel, so you gain nothing by holding on to them. It's true that if you have 255 of a consumable then packs will start giving you level 1 weapon rail amps. It is not true however, that if you max out your weapon rail amps, ammo types and armor modules, that jumbo equipment packs start giving you nothing but ultra-rare weapons. Unless you have a desperate need for pistol rail amp Is, I suggest using your consumables. I guarantee you'll make more money that way.
* It's often fairly sensible to wait for a bit and tap the spacebar than revive instantly and hope that noone noticed your death. You don't want to run out of medigel and die just before deactivating the fourth device because you used a medigel of shame during wave 1.
* You can often cancel the 'getting up' animation with a heavy melee or a dodge. Useful if a praetorian is over your corpse.

**THERMAL CLIP PACKS**

* Thermal clip packs restore your ammo, reload your weapon, provide you with up to10 grenades, and, according to BSN user peddroelmz's measurements, give you a 100% additive damage boost for a few seconds.
* As with other consumables, you might want to remap the key for thermal clip packs to something convenient (I have it on 'Z').

Finally: a reminder that failing the wave 10 objective on gold when you have a realistic shot at succeeding without using every last consumable is a pointless economy. You loose far more money than you gain.

And to be sure, the decoy is one of the most useful abilities in the game if your team wants to complete an objective without 4 phantoms prancing around their corpses. But many salarian engineers end up with lowish points totals. This is a bit of a shame, because many of the engineer's abilities synergize well with using big guns to blow off enemies' faces. I've tried to produce a guide to helping your team, *and* doing respectable damage. 

[Here](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#22PPDNJI9@0KE@@D4E4@0@0) is my build. Since I don't have too much in incinerate, I find that I'm a little weaker against reapers than the other two factions. The decoy still distracts reapers, if placed carefully, and energy drain can still provide survivability when fighting marauders and banshees. Packing a big-arse gun will allow you to get through any faction.

First though, you need to know everything about your abilities. brain dump follows:

**Energy Drain**

This ability does 220 base damage, increased to 517 if you go all for all damage evolutions and all power damage in your passive. It also does 3x damage versus shields, for a total of 1551 damage. This *cannot* one-shot the shields of a member of cerberus on gold, so it should be clear to you that energy drain is really not there to damage shields but to improve your engineer's survivability. And it does - draining a barrier, shield or synthetic enemy (geth, turret or atlas) instantly restores your shields. Energy drain also stuns most organic enemies who are down to health, which is useful if you use a weapon like the scorpion or GPS, which can sometimes be vulnerable to lag (or terrible aiming in my case).

There's some debate over whether the rank 6 evolution ""Armor boost"" works when you're not the host. Most of the sensible posters on the BSN agree however that it's just that you don't see the visual effect. Certainly I seem to notice the difference off host.

The BSN is also fairly unsure of how long the electrical effect of energy drain is. ~~The consensus is, though, that if you use it on organic enemies' health or shields, you must detonate within 1 second, or within 3 seconds on shields or on synthetic enemies. Compare this with the 3.5 second duration of overload and disruptor ammo. Not long, eh? You probably aren't going to be detonating your own tech bursts without disruptor ammo - incinerate has a loooooong travel time to its target and your cooldown even with 200% is 2.46 seconds.~~ Who gives a damn what the BSN thinks! Actual information from someone who knows what he's talking about - [link](http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/12648909). The window is 3 seconds!

There's a variable called ""maxtargets"" in the coalesced file, set to 2. It seems to limit the number of enemies hit by energy drain to two, or at least does in my testing (in fact, lots of powers have this limitation). So damage rather than radius is a respectable choice.

Finally, know that using energy drain on barriers or shields stops the damage over time effect of swarmers and banshee warps instantly.

**Decoy**

The real meat of the class - this is the reason why you picked salarian engineer. When you cast decoy, it will appear 5m in front of you\*. You can cast it through walls, which is very useful if you're familiar with spawn points. For example, if you're sheparding a drone on firebase white and you're going up the stairs from the desks to the LZ, you can face the wall inbetween the two flights of stairs and the decoy you cast will appear in the inside staircase, ready for the primes that are coming down to meet you. Casting the decoy near spawn points, then running back to the rest of your team can make objective waves very, *very* easy.

One mistake some players make is not to cast the decoy preemptively. They cast it after they get in trouble and not before. If a phantom has seen you, she will continue to chase after you unless the decoy is actually in front of her. Enemies don't go after targets they can't see - [Interesting thread on that topic](http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/13287526&amp;lf=8). Make sure, then, to place the decoy somewhere visible. It's also a good idea to cast the ability around corners, so that you don't end up with a face full of marauder elbow. The decoy can be used as a scout like that.

Getting a banshee trapped on a decoy is definitely a mitzve for your teammates. In my experience, to do this the banshee has to either be in its non-jumping phase, or it has to try to travel past the decoy while it's in a *very* confined space - so confined that a character would have to elbow past the decoy. Still, once trapped, she seems to stay there helplessly novaing the decoy until the rest of the team can take her down. Getting atlases trapped similarly requires you to approach very closely and cast the decoy practically on their groin.

My decoy says it has 1900 shields, but you've probably noticed that decoys last a lot longer than their shield total would seem to suggest. If we have a look in coalesced.ini\*, we can find the answer - your decoy has 50% damage reduction. Because of [the weird way](http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/11481777) damage reduction in mp works, my decoy should actually have around 3000 effective shields.

Despite the fact that the shock evolution leaves a sparkly electrical side effect, it doesn't seem to set up tech bursts ([this BSN post](http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/9629730/1) agrees with my findings)). The shock evolution does however prevent enemy shields from recharging while they engage the decoy, and if you cast the decoy a bit too late and it ends up behind the enemy, the stun will often shock them back behind it. Your other choice is recharge speed, and who, frankly, takes that on any power? 

There appears to be a limit on how many enemies will target the decoy at the same time. This [balance change](http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/9544143/1#11488308) ""decreased the maximum number of enemies that will target them at the same time."" I can't find any details in coalesced.ini though.

One thing to bear in mind is that during objective waves random teammates, if they see 6 enemies crowding round the decoy, are quite likely to use their cobra missiles, and force the enemy to respawn right next to the infiltrator disarming the devices. During most objective waves, it's a good idea to leave snagged enemies alone. Especially during a wave 10 hack objective, a decoy can grant sensible teammates a few seconds free of the endless banshee-cobra cycle.

Finally, be aware that AoE attacks, like a geth flamethrower, can still hit you if you're standing right behind the decoy. That should be an obvious point, but it's quite easy to forget until your face is actually on fire.

**Incinerate**

I'm not a fan of this power. It takes its time traveling towards the enemy, which means that, unlike energy drain, it can be dodged. You also won't be setting off your own tech bursts with it, and setting fire explosions up requires killing the enemy which is difficult with your other power unless you're fighting geth. Unlike energy drain, it has no AoE without the rank 4 evolution. Also bear in mind that the frost synergy evolution is broken - you do extra damage only to frozen enemies, not to chilled ones.

It does have its uses though. With three points in it, you can set up fire explosions on geth crowding your decoy (but you can't really do this with organic enemies, firstly because energy drain does 50% damage to them and probably won't kill them, and secondly because they don't really engage your decoy at point blank range like the geth). I also use it to hook around cover, dislodging far away enemies so that they can get a few shots to the face.

AFK hiding in a back room, leeches, missile glitchers, etc., which are real issues.

Over the weekend, was on wave 10 with three randoms, all of whom had been playing well and normally.  Pizza delivery mission.  First pizza delivered by one player.  Second player grabs the second pizza, runs to the opposite side of the map from the extraction zone, and hunkers down in cover to shoot enemies.  I've seen it happen before where people will team up to delay delivery to trade off time bonuses for extra kill bonuses.  Whatever.  This wasn't that.  Minutes ticked down, no movement toward exctraction - just hunkering and shooting, and some movement to get ammo.  Non-responsive to various mic entreaties to deliver the #^$&amp;# pizza.  Non responsive to the rest of us shooting him in the face from three sides.  Let the clock run down without moving, intentionally wiping the group on wave 10.  Left as soon as the mission was over.  WTF?

Trolling or indoctrinated, we should have a mechanism for dealing with this in game.  It's infuriating.

Only on XBOX and PC, sorry PS3 users.

Operation Goliath
Citadel Allied Command is mounting a galaxy-wide operation to cripple the Reapers’ shock troops: the turian-krogan hybrids known as “brutes.” To flush out Reaper ground forces, N7 teams are deploying to engage the enemy in key theaters. Heavy reinforcements are expected anywhere fighting begins.

Community Goal: Inflict heavy casualties on Reaper “brutes” on March 16th, 17th, and 18th.

Community Unlock: If this goal is met, all N7 squads will be awarded a Victory Pack that can be unlocked the following week.

Squad Goal: Successful extraction from a Reaper-held zone at a Silver threat level or higher.

Squad Unlock: Your squad will be granted a Commendation Pack.

Your allies are counting on you. Now is not the time to let them down.

Any player who is part of a squad that beats the Reaper faction on Silver difficulty or better will unlock one Commendation Pack. This means that at least one member of the squad must be extracted at the end of the mission – this will earn all squad members the reward. Each player can earn a maximum of one pack, and each pack contains a random N7 Arsenal Weapon. Originally only available as single-player weapons via the N7 Collector’s Edition, these multiplayer variants will be exceptionally rare and are NOT obtainable through regular purchasable Reinforcement Packs. The Commendation Packs will contain one of the following guns at random: N7 Crusader Shotgun, N7 Eagle Pistol, N7 Hurricane SMG, and N7 Valiant Sniper Rifle.

Destroy as many brutes as possible – if the multiplayer community kills a combined 1 MILLION brutes within the hours of the challenge, ALL players will receive a Victory Pack as a reward.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,Cerberus,True,t3_qzqxo,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/qzqxo/n7_event_tonight_starting_5pm_beat_reapers_to/,

1360400318.0,48,self.MECoOp,186p7e,Companion Video:  Making the Jump to Gold,51,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/186p7e/companion_video_making_the_jump_to_gold/,"To demonstrate some of the principles from my [Making the Jump to Gold post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16zcwq/me_coop_college_501_making_the_jump_to_gold/), I've made a video which I hope some people will find helpful.  Rather than focusing on game mechanics or builds, the goal here is to demonstrate some of the in-game playstyle principles than can help you to be effective on Gold.  More specifically, the goal is to show you the value of mobility / soft cover with regard to survivability, and also to cover some of the decision making that can make a match proceed smoothly.

For this effort, I'm using all Uncommon goods because I want to show how using items only obtained from VPs can still be effective on Gold.  Specifically, I'm using a [3/6/6/6/5 Turian Sentinel](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Sentinel/Turian/DQLPJ/Mattock10AD5AE5//AssaultRifleRailAmp3//AssaultRifleAmp5/) with the Mattock (sorry, don't remember the Armor Module I selected here and don't have it on video).  I'm also playing with a PUG specifically picked to be about Par for random Gold lobbies; the idea is to present a viable style of play that is accessible to any player (though technically, the consumable upgrades I have are usually obtained through higher-tier packs).

Keep in mind, this is not meant to be a demonstration of the only way to play higher difficulties effectively.  There are many, many better players than myself.  But, I think the general principles on display here are effective and can be utilized by players of all skill, with a little practice.

I've put up two versions of the video, since not everyone will want to listen to my commentary (it's the first time I've tried, so not exactly my specialty).  I also cover some of the highlights from the non-commentary video below.

[**Commentary Video**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roVmJGaiotw)

[**Non-Commentary Video**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ)

Note, if you watched the commentary video, I did make one blatantly incorrect statement.  I claim a synergy between two characters with Overload for Tech Bursts, but this simply isn't true.  The Primer and the Detonator need to be different - in retrospect, I regretted saying this but I didn't want to re-record 25 minutes of commentary for the third time.

As for highlights, here are several of the moments which I think are most instructive:

* [Checking Flanks: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=15m52s) After killing several enemies, it's possible new ones will be spawning behind you.  Check your flanks periodically to make sure nothing has snuck up behind you.  Here, I check twice and eventually discover a Pyro that has gotten too close.

* [Covering Teammates: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=9m9s) Here, I have a teammate camping the LZ in hard cover, and I'm watching his back by dealing with the high ground behind him.

* [Staying Safe with Mobility: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=11m13s) The team is getting swarmed after an objective and I lose my shieldgate.  I run away and reposition while my shields restore.

* [Soft Cover: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=13m7s) You can use soft cover to limit the number of enemies with line-of-sight on you.  Here, I back out of line of sight from a Rocket Trooper so that I can take on a Hunter with minimal risk.

* [Avoiding Attacks with Movement: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=14m2s) As long as your are mobile, enemies have a much lower chance of hitting you.  Fortunately, I have a good connection with the host here and avoid a Rocket by moving laterally from his point of view while approaching him.

* [Retreat and Reposition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=8m14s) &amp; [Retreate and Reposition 2: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=16m53s) If you're in the open, on the move, or in a generally unfavorable position, the best option is often to run away and approach your enemies from their flank.  Note, I use an Ops Pack in both links to ensure I don't go down in the midst of a swarm of enemies.

* [Right Hand Advantage: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=23m22s) While this is a fairly poor execution of the technique, the principle remains the same.  You can move clockwise around a block of cover like this to minimize the chance that you will be hit by your opponent.

* [Hero Revive: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=9m27s) When enemies are targeting your teammates, you can often sneak in for a quick revive without the risk of taking too much damage.  Just make sure to run away quickly and move out of their line-of-sight after reviving.

* [Cover Revive: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=15m46s) When you have the opportunity, try to use line-of-sight cover to revive your teammates.

* [Revive Missile: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=12m3s) When a couple of your teammates go down near a heavy enemy, or a swarm of enemies, a missile can be a very helpful tool.  While it may seem overkill, it can prevent your team from going down and getting swarmed even more.

* [Spawn Nuking: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=18m31s) Again, a poor execution, but in late waves, if you can take out a spawn with a missile, it can make the match proceed more quickly.  Only recommended if you have the missiles to spare.

* [Double Boss Missile: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=19m51s) Similar to spawn nuking, if you can take out two dangerous bosses (in addition to more enemies) with one missile in a late wave, it can help the team.

* [Switch Targets Missile: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=22m4s) In an enemy targets objective, if your missile kills a lower-tier enemy along with a boss, there is a chance the target type will switch to the lower-tier enemy.  In this case, it made the final objective wave proceed more smoothly.

* [Hero Device Objective: ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8MFEQbUhCQ&amp;t=4m7s) This was a very risky play and, frankly, excecuted poorly.  I should have checked my right flank before starting the objective to get rid of the Prime Turret.  That said, I was taking advantage of my teammates distracting the Prime for a device location that can be very difficult, and it barely managed to pay off.  This is also where using relatively tanky classes can help.

I hope some people find this a helpful example of effective gameplay.  I would like to recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvAYYO3DQo#t=6m50s), originally recommended by Multidisciplinary, as another great source for moving up in difficulties.  It features a much better player and some excellent advice.

So that's it.  As usual, I'm happy to take feedback and respond to anyone that disagrees with my comments.

*Note:  If people think this is worth adding to my original post, I will add it.  But I wanted to run it by you guys first to make sure it's worthwhile.*

Now that we're at 200, I wanted to do some touch ups on the list:

* The first and primary thing I want to do, is add a ""Difficulty Viability"" or a ""Rating"" category. Of course, I'm rubbish at seeing how good a build is for various difficulties, so I was hoping some of our elite players (preferably people who can solo platinum, or &lt;user idea here&gt;).  The idea would either be to go through the builds and see what difficulty a given build is best on. I realize that may be hard, as playstyles vary. My alternative is a 5 star rating system. Again, based on a few of the subreddit's elite players, it would give a general idea of the synergy and playability of the build. Downsides are that there are numerous ""fun"" builds that would get bad ratings and thus overlooked. 

* The second thing I want to do, is figure out what builds are archaic and no longer worth having on the list (due to balance changes). Again, I'm rubbish at determining these things, but my best idea for this is to have submitters look over their builds and update them and send me new build links or just tell me they're archaic and have them marked as such. (I currently plan on leaving archaic builds in the BBLoB for the sake of stats). 

I have to give a tip of the hat to the following users for exceptional contribution.

* First and foremost: /u/RepublicanShredder. Dude makes up 17% of the list with his 34 builds. He's also the only one who has at least one build for every class. 
* /u/spark2 is a more *recent* incarnation of Shred and has gotten 11 posted so far. (Only missing a Sentinel.)
* /u/blackmarketdolphins, /u/SalsaDips, /u/ABeardedPanda, /u/InterwebNinja, /u/mrcle123, /u/UnholyDemigod, /u/Multidisciplinary all have made at least 5 builds and, combined with spark2 and Shred, combine for nearly half of the builds.
* /u/bigbossodin deserves recognition for his Murdertrain series, which will rarely be spelled correctly by me. (Sadly that's his only contribution, as I can imagine that his... enthusiasm could add much more to the list).

While they may not live up to their billing as some of the deadliest fighters in the galaxy in SP, played right the MP asari kits are some of the best in the game. To get the most out of them, read on below.

**General Advice**

The asari are all biotic kits. To utilise them to their maximum potential, you should know the mechanics of biotic explosions, when to use them, how to co-ordinate best with other biotic teammates and so forth. I recommend familiarising yourself with the links in the sidebar for a basic overview. Generally all the kits have at least a biotic primer, so using warp ammo on your weapons will give a big damage boost. They will all work brilliantly with each other, and also in general biotic death squads. While their squishiness may seem to force them towards a long-range playstyle, in reality they can also shine with hit-and-run tactics at medium to CQC range, and will often deal much more damage doing so. 

**Racial Passive and Fitness**

The kits share the racial passive, Asari Justicar- it offers strong power damage bonuses, as befitting an entirely species of biotics, and is balanced by offering somewhat lower weapon damage. The final evolution is for heavy pistols, apart from the Justicar Adept, who has  an evo for Assault Rifles. 

Their fitness isn't great, but the asari do come with one of the best dodges in the game. Arguably the best, in my book, the biotic skating. Precise and quick, but the downside is it drains your barriers somewhat. Well worth it though as judicious use will keep you dancing with boss units safely, and bring you in and out of soft cover easily. Usually not worth spec'ing into melee, unless you're playing a specific build for a couple of kits (Huntress, Valkyre) which I'll mention later. 

**Asari Adept**

The very first overpowered kit when the game was released (the only nerf in the first set of balances changes is a nerf to Stasis), the metagame has seen this former queen of crowd control and biotic explosions fall behind a little. That said, she still offers plenty of power and damage.

* Stasis: An excellent crowd control power, especially on lower difficulties. Stasis will freeze in place any enemy that doesn't have armour, making it one of the few biotic abilities to work on shielded enemies like Geth Hunter, Centurions and most importantly, Phantoms. The bubble evolution in rank 6 will trap multiple enemies and can be very beneficial in saving teammates about to get stomped or sync-killed. 
* Warp: Solid all-around biotic power. The primer for most biotic explosions the adept will unleash. Also good at debuffing bosses. Does get dodged, so if you want to use it on smaller enemies like Dragoons, make sure you're either at medium range or closer, or initiate the dodge animation first by shooting etc
* Throw: Good detonator for BEs. Very quick cooldown. Also good for staggering enemies. 

The adept is generally used either as a caster-sniper, or as a BE-based destroyer. I prefer the latter, with stasis adding a strong CC component to her skill set that differentiates her to the Human Sentinel. You'll find a couple of builds on the BBLoB, with hopefully my newly-written up Thessian Demolisher to be added shortly. The Carnifex, Paladin, Talon (my favourite), Wraith, Hurricane etc all work very well on her. Heck if you take a power efficiency amp, a heavier weapon with warp ammo becomes feasible too. 

**Asari Justicar Adept**

This kit stands out, if only because she looks different and has different armour to the standard asari. She also has a different racial, where power duration is offered over power damage, which benefits her powers considerably. She synergises well with almost any team, and is one of the easiest kits with which to step up to playing higher difficulties.

* Biotic Sphere: The Justicar casts a biotic bubble. This can be spec’d either for offense (enemies take more damage) or defence (players in the bubble get added damage reduction). I prefer the offensive bubble, but it is a tricky art to master, requiring good knowledge of enemy spawns and map chokepoints. The evolution for added radius is a must, while warp effect at rank 6 will her set off her own BEs on Reaved targets, and prime un-Reaved targets to be detonated by Reave. On the other hand, defensive bubble is a great help during hacks and the like. Test both, see which one suits you.
* Reave: Reave is an excellent power and should always be taken to rank 6. It acts as both a primer and detonator for BEs (but not for itself, of course) , and gives the Justicar a lot of damage reduction, making her very tanky. It has a DoT component meaning it can be used as a fire-and-forget power, and it also stacks on itself (up to three times). 
* Pull: Arguably the weakest power, but still useful for CC in some situtations. Acts as a biotic primer that can be detonated using Reave. The Acolyte has made a Pull-Reave AJA build very viable, and there’s some plat solo videos with that set up floating around Youtube. Also good for removing pesky Guardian shields and the like. 

There’s quite a few builds on the BBLoB, so I would tinker around till you find one that suits. My personal preference is to ignore pull, use the bubble for offense and reave everything in sight and hit it with warp-ammo’d Harrier/Saber etc. She’s the closest thing to a biotic soldier amongst the asari kits, able to absorb a decent amount of punishment via Reave’s protections, and synergises very well with other asari kits. 

**Asari Valkyrie Sentinel**

The close-in brawler of the asari kits, the Valkyrie demands careful management by players and in return offers excellent killing potential, both via weapons and BEs. Tech armour offers good survivability, and allows her to stay alive at the distances Annihilation Field needs her to be at to work.

* Tech Armour: Standard sentinel power. Allows for extra tankiness when married with fitness. Usually its smarter to take ranks in it and both fitness rather than max it out, as the DR it offers is based on fitness. The best combinations are either 3/5 or 4/4. Power damage is not that crucial, while recharge time on warp can be made manageable by gear or consumables. 
* Warp: Here, it’s a detonator as opposed to a primer, but still a strong power. The standard evos of detonate/expose/pierce  should still be taken as it will also be debuffing anything you throw it at. 
* Annihilation Field: As with the Fury, the Valkyrie does her best work close-in thanks to this power. Movement speed versus debuff is a wash, I prefer debuff for boss-killing. Shield drain is  great evo that will keep you alive in many hairy situations, as it applies to any damage done to an affected target. 

Essentially, you can either play her as a tankier Fury, with your BEs coming slower but TA keeping you alive longer, or you can you go with a more weapon-focussed build, debuffing with both AF and Warp, detonating the occasional BE but mostly dishing out the pain with a heavy shotgun like a Raider or a Reegar. One of my favourite kits to take to Platinum because of how good a boss-killer she can be. There is also a decent melee Valkyrie build out there being run on gold by some players, but I’ve never tried it myself. Search youtube.

**Asari Huntress Infiltrator**

From CQC brawler to DoT assassin- the Huntress is one of the most unique infiltrator kits thanks to the power damage she can get from her cloak, and fills one of the most ubiquitous weaknesses of an all-biotic team since cloaking makes life much easier for objective capping, tough revives etc. She is also one of the easiest characters to solo with, especially against Reapers, if anyone is looking to do that soon.

* Tactical Cloak: That old infiltrator power, with a new twist. The Huntress does NOT get any bonus weapon damage from cloak, however she does get stronger power damage (and melee damage). Casting Dark Channel from cloak makes a DoT nightmare that can even chew through bosses without any problems, and the 3 second TC cooldown means that heavy weapons can be carried without hobbling casting too much.
* Dark Channel: An average power on the Fury, but one that shines on the Huntress. Cast it from cloak, as mentioned above, and watch carve through an entire mook spawn, or even take down a Phantom. The ultimate fire-and-forget power. Also a primer, if you want to detonate with warp. Note that detonating it does not end the DoT effect. 
* Warp: A detonator and a debuffer here. Talked about it enough before. 

The best way to play her is listed on the BBLoB. No, not my guide which was sadly superseded by the buffs from BioWare, but [mrcle123’s build and post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/14un6o/unnecessarily_long_guide_channeled_blue_death/). You can of course go the alternate builds, but that is by far the optimal one. An interesting variant is the melee Huntress, again not listed here, but one I’ve seen played very effectively on Plat. Her melee damage is boosted by cloak, and is AoE meaning she can simply run, debuff and one-shot mooks and elite mooks with her heavy melee. 

**Asari Vanguard**

The vanguard was thought to be underwhelming for a long time, but a buff to lift grenades and the release of grenade gear has definitely seen her step up a notch as a damage-dealing character. Her powers offer a mix of crowd control and traditional vanguard nuking ability, and the excellent asari dodge can keep her alive after she’s charged into danger.

* Biotic Charge: The vanguard staple. Evos will depend on playstyle. I prefer grenade nuking, so opt for power synergy at rank 5.
* Stasis: As with the adept, this ability offers a good CC option, and also allows for detonation via charge.
* Lift Grenades: Superb damage dealers. Terrible primers and detonators as they will only work on health-bar targets. Anything down to a healthbar when a grenade hits it is going to be dead. Don’t bother trying to base a playstyle around that aspect of them, just use them to straight up kill stuff. 

Again, there are a number of different builds on the BBLoB. She’s a great detonator for her adept sisters, and works well alongside the Valkyrie on the frontlines. Equally capable of destroying mook spawns or taking on boss units. Use the dodge to full effect here (charge then dodge sideways or backwards), and staying alive on any difficulty becomes easier. 

**Conclusions**

The asari offer a great mix of kits, allowing players to employ a variety of different playstyles at different ranges. In the hands of a player  who masters them, they offer excellent DPS at any difficulty level, and their squishiness can definitely be offset by their mobility. Those of us who love the space magic that Mass Effect offers, the difference that distinguishes it from many other games, should definitely have the asari amongst their favourite and most-used kits. From their deadliness on the battlefield, it is easy to see why they are considered amongst the most deadly individual warriors in the galaxy, on par with the krogan Battlemasters.

Don't waste your credits, much less any real money, until they get that sorted out.

In the category of ""Bioware is full of dicks, apparently"":

They actually released the DLC for the Xbox 360, including the new maps, but failed to add the new drops into the existing reinforcement packs.  People aren't just running out and buying it willy-nilly, they downloaded the DLC and had good reason to believe they'd have access.

Edit:

Just so that I don't have to respond to all of the Bioware white knights and apologists individually when they claim ""they said that the DLC gear would only come in special packs"" or ""of course you'd have to wait for the DLC to go live"":

1.  The official blog said that the new content would come out of ""reinforcement packs"" which is the term the official Mass Effect 3 FAQ to refer to the recruit, veteran, and Spectre packs.  Similarly, the video everyone defending Bioware links to (at a curious time stamp) includes this statement by the reps: ""All of the characters, weapons, and consumables will be added to the pack pool to be unlocked with credits like you would unlock anything in the main game.""  The Resurgence Packs you're referring to are *on top of their promise to put the new content in existing packs*.

2.  The DLC was made available to download on Xbox 360 early this morning, and there is *always* an expectation that when you download DLC that's when you can start using it.

Condensed Version in the comments.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/qt5br/class_breakdown_strengths_and_weaknesses/c408i5v)

##Human##

-------------------------------

**Sentinel**

Strengths: Both hardy and agile.  Good reflexes make Sentinels hard to kill.  Throw and Warp combos allow for biotic explosions and cause massive damage.

Weakness: Very few.  Both hard to kill and hard hitting, Human Sentinels have very little trouble with most enemies.  Encumbering yourself with heavy weapons makes Warp + Throw combos hard, meaning they should stick with light weapons.

Good Against: Non-shielded enemies.

Poor Against: Atlas, Primes.

-------------------------------

**Vanguard**

Strength: Biotic Charge and Nova combos are devastating.  Biotic charge has a lot of utility both as a means of escaping dangerous enemies, replenishing your shields, and being a go-to for direct offensive force.  Works well with shotgun weapons, but should avoid over-weighting themselves to ensure they will be able to charge in and  out of battle.

Weakness: Biotic Charge and Nova combos can leave Vanguards in very vulnerable situations.  Biotic charge also displaces the Vanguard away from protection provided by the rest of his or her team.  Charging larger distances may expose the Vanguard to unseen enemies(particularly dangerous with hard-hitting ranged enemies like Ravagers and Primes)

Good against: Light enemy clusters.

Poor against: Banshees, Ravagers, Phantoms.

-------------------------------
  
**Soldier**

Strengths: Adrenaline Rush instantly refills the soldier's current clip, which allows the soldier to capitalize on weapons with limited clips but high damage. Frag grenades can be spec'd to handle shields more effectively.   

Weakness:  Concussion shot is relatively weak, even at its highest levels.  Cryo ammo equipment might help with this, but it is a high expense to make the human soldier stronger.

Good Against: Most Cerberus Forces, Atlas(w/Shield Spec Frag Grenades), Brutes/Ravagers(w/Armor Spec Frags)

Poor Against: Banshees, Phantoms.

-------------------------------

**Adept**

Strengths: Combos are the Adept's bread and butter.  Lightly loaded adepts can chain warp and shockwaves combos, and Lift specced shock waves can help crowd control for your team.

Weakness:  Heavier enemies cannot be lifted by singularity and are largely immune to it. Light enemies surrounding heavier ones allow the adept to overcome this fairly easily.

Good Against: Enemy clusters and light enemies.

Poor Against: Heavy enemies, shielded enemies.

-------------------------------

**Engineer**

Strengths:  Lightly loaded engineers are a walking force of nature.  Overload allows them to significantly damage shields and barriers, while incinerate takes care of flesh and armor.  The drone seeks out and distracts enemies, allowing the engineer to perform exceptionally well against single targets.

Weaknesses: The Engineer is somewhat vulnerable to numbers, unless specc'd for Chain Overload and actively Tech-Bursting enemies.  While his powers can devastate the most powerful of enemies right out of the box, his options are limited against superior numbers.  He can overcome this slightly by his weapons, but this hinders his ability to bring down Banshee, Prime and Atlas enemies.

Good Against: Any enemy, 1-on-1.  Especially Geth.

Poor Against: Fighting enemy clusters.

-------------------------------

**Infiltrator**

Strengths: Tactical Cloaking is great for completing objectives and rescuing allies in somewhat hard to reach areas, as well as amplify damage.  Cyro Blast can immobilize unshielded enemies, and weaken enemy armor.  Sticky grenades can be spec'd into proximity mines, which can devastate enemies as they cross them.  Overall, Human Infiltrators are a great support class.

Weaknesses:  Due to the limited nature of grenades, the Infiltrator has very few powers that are exceptionally great.  The Infiltrator, for damage, will largely rely on their weapons, especially sniper rifles, or melee for damage.

Good Against: Light or Armored enemies.  Slow enemies.

Poor Against: Shielded and Barrier'd enemies.

-------------------------------



##Krogan##

------------------------------

**Soldier**

Strengths:  A well balanced Krogan Soldier is devastating to fleshy and armored enemies.  A moderate set of weapons (Either at or below weight capacity), and specing Carnage(Damage, Recharge Speed), Krogan Berserker(Power Damage), and Incineration Grenades allows the Krogan to initiate Fire Explosions by himself.  Carnage, when specced fully for damage, can devastate brutes and ravagers.  

Weaknesses:  Shielded or Barrier'd enemies need to be worn down a bit with weapons or by allies. Fortification provides excellent damage resistance, but can be harmful to the Krogan's damage output by limiting his ability to Carnage.

Good Against:  Most Reapers and Cerberus Troops.

Poor Against: Barrier'd or Shielded enemies.

Note: Krogan Soldiers and Salarian or Human Engineers make a powerful combo.

-------------------------------

**Sentinel**

Strengths: Krogan Sentinels are incredibly durable, especially when buffed by Rage and Tech armor.   This allows them to safely get close to enemies and use heavy weapons safely.  Speccing into Power Damage, and Power Recharge allows the Krogan Sentinel to use extremely devastating Lift Grenades and Incinerations.

Weaknesses: Lift Grenades come in limited supply, so Power Damage focused Krogan Sentinels should reserve them for large clusters of enemies, or very powerful enemies.  Incineration is only effective against armored and non-shielded/barrier'd.  

Good Against:  Armored Enemies

Poor Against:  Shielded and Barrier'd Enemies.

I swear to you this stuff comes from a future where people have mastered the art of looking great while melting faces. You always have to pause when a Sentinel shows up, possibly running around them a little. And if it's a Paladin, tell them to bust out their shield and never let go.
&gt;
&gt;**Notes from the Unofficial Cerberus Handbook (On Sentinels)**
&gt;
&gt;**If you think she's scary now, wait until you run out of nachos...**
&gt;
&gt;The Valkyrie is the kind of warrior who'll run up to you and rip your heart out by exploding you. Your body vaporized, your organs slushing on the ground like fish out of water, there's nothing left for this crazy wombo combo lady to do than to crouch over the bloody vestiges of your pathetic mook self and eat your soul. She won't even wipe away the blood.
&gt;
&gt;**This savage beast has mastered technology! Run far away.**
&gt;
&gt;For most of history the Krogan were stuck on their homeworld, where they made war on their eternal enemy, the Krogan. Giving them massive technological improvements and pushing them into a galaxy full of aliens with itchy trigger fingers might not seem like the best idea in hindsight, but centuries of war and self-annihilation could only lead to this, the Krogan's ultimate destiny: to hit things with their armor plated heads (and then make them go boom).
&gt;
&gt;**Reach and flexibility are everything you'd want... in a wardrobe.**
&gt;
&gt;The Turian Sentinel's tactical capabilities are well understood and will bear no repetition. But have you ever noticed his impeccable taste in fashion? Have you ever taken in the poise with which he takes cover, reloads his Claymore, breathes in the vapor of your perfectly aimed grenade (which had no effect!) and shoots at you? But of course you never caught any of that, because as soon as the bullets flew over your head, and you thought it was safe to take a peek, you exploded.
&gt;
&gt;**He Used to be a Construction Worker**
&gt;
&gt;""I hit my toe again,"" said no Krogan Warlord ever.
&gt;
&gt;We've been trying to grow hammer-resistant troops, but that experiment hasn't been working out too well, so if you see this guy, just kill yourself and try to fall where he might trip over you. Don't even bother trying to run away. He's faster. Sacrifice for the hive. You'll be remembered in the annals of our Reaper overlords.
&gt;
&gt;**Basically James Bond**
&gt;
&gt;So you've gone through the super secret training and augmentation project and become a full fledged Phantom. Good for you! You're now ready to take on anything in the galaxy, except for this. The only sentinel stylish enough to wear his armor on his wrist, and bust it out only when he needs it, the N7 Paladin. He can freeze you with his gaze and electrify you with his voice, and if need be, he can smash loose your cool facade. Wait, what just went flying? That's right, it was you. See you next Tuesday, grasshopper. And don't mumble.
&gt;
&gt;**For 300 points, this disease bearing creature can multiply quickly...**
&gt;
&gt;You want to kill it with fire, well so does it. The only difference is, it comes back. No, I'm not talking about that bug you picked up on Noveria when you let Binary Helix play with your gene code. That would be too easy. I'm talking about Vorcha, but not your run of the mill, scum of the sewers kind of vorcha, I'm talking about the real deal monstrously regenerating, pouncing, slashing, flaming special ops Vorcha. If you shoot this guy I'm pretty sure he just gets horny. (Bring lots of ammo.)
&gt;
&gt;**Before the war he was a humble fisherman, err, pirate, marauder, thingy.**
&gt;
&gt;""Stop struggling."" The batarian says this when he wants to comfort the wounded. Imagine what he'll say to you, not that you'll be talking a lot. The only conversation between you and him will be fist to mouth. I hope you're into BDSM, cause this guy will tie you up, throw you around, then puncture your soft tissue with sharp objects. On occasion he might stop and laugh maniacally. When that happens, brace for impact.
&gt;
&gt;**If they weren't soldiers they'd be yuppies.**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The basic Human Sentinels don't get enough credit. They can shoot, tear apart matter and space, and take a beating. They're basically adepts equipped with adamantine holographic armor. But then again, that was the idea. The only tip worth giving: if the guy next to you suddenly turns purple, it's not the time for a group hug. If it's you, I'm sorry to say this, but heaven is a DMV and there is no wireless.
&gt;
&gt;**Don't punch these little guys unless you can punch really hard.** 
&gt;
&gt;From my observations on the battlefield the Volus have a single calling, suicide, and they're terrible at it. The odds are astronomical but these fat gnomelets fail time and again to get themselves killed. I know what you're going to say, and no, I hadn't thought about sending bullets into their round, inviting bodies. We just launched sandwhices at them in the hope that they would die of morbid obesity. It was a war of attrition, mostly for our side. We ran out of salami, and their shields kept regenerating. One day three Volus and a Krogan broke into our warehouse and ate everything, including the indoctrinated Salarians. The only way out was through, but who's nutty enough to take on Krogan stomach acid?

1372903017.0,46,self.MECoOp,1hlvyf,Store Update,55,9,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1hlvyf/store_update/,"Since the last DLC, I've been meaning to update my post about the store to reflect all of the data we collected then.  My hope was that I'd be able to collect some more data post-DLC to see if any of the UR rates were changing, and while I have data on my own packs, I don't have enough on anything other than SPs to conclude if UR drop rates have changed from what we observed during Reckoning DLC.

I've updated my [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/178zwt/me_coop_college_408_store/) to reflect everything I know about the store as of now.  If you don't want to reread that whole post, I've included the main updates below:

* Best guess for drop rates is 15% in PSPs, Arsenals, and Reserves, while 7.5% in SPs.  SPs have been pretty consistent since we've been measuring them.  There have been some spikes and dips, but it always seems to come back to around 8%.  I'm guessing 7.5% because that would make sense compared to the 15% measured in the other packs.  As of the last DLC, all three of the 99000 packs measured in around 15%, and we have data on more than 1500 of them combined.  The only worry is that these numbers are biased by some sort of day-of-DLC effect.  An UR unlock rate of only 12-13% for these packs would mean they have the same value as SPs.  Anything less than that and they would be a worse value.

* Reserve Packs drop Common Character cards 50% of the time.  That's an effective waste of 100,000 credits per million spent (unless you're working on N7 Mastery).   On the other hand, Arsenals are the only pack (besides JEPs) not to unlock Common Character cards.  For the sake of purely maximizing UR drops without losing out on equipment slots, Arsenals may offer the best value.

* PSPs and SPs still seem to offer the same value for Rare items... if you have an unmaxed Rare manifest.  This effect largely seems to stem from the frequency with which SPs unlock Rare Weapon Mods in the 4th (equipment) slot.  Once Rare Mods are maxed, PSPs should offer a slightly better value for other Rare items.

* Arsenal and Reserve packs appear to offer the best value for Rare Gear.

* Arsenal packs unlock Uncommon items in their third slot at a surprisingly decent rate, making them a fairly well-rounded option for someone still working on leveling up an Uncommon / Rare manifest.

Based on all of this, for someone leveling up their manifest, I would still suggest a mix of packs.  I'd stay away from Reserve Packs simply because of all the wasted credits on the Common Characters, but if you really want to unlock new characters as quickly as possible, they are obviously the best option.

Hey guys and gals, I'm FemShep from me3tweaks (http://me3tweaks.blogspot.com). I write guides and make tools for modding ME3. My main tool is Coalesced Mod Manager.
I've been looking around for some people to help me test my tools from my site, and I figured since this is a Mass Effect reddit, it'd be a good place to find people who are interested.

Mainly I mod MP, mainly because the stock experience bores me (too repetitive after 700 hours). I don't use mods to cheat either, since cheating is for losers (I still don't have some of the guns :-( )

Examples of what I've modded: Switch teams (can't do damage... sadly, but you can epic troll), lower gravity, harder enemies, zombie mod abomination runs (kills framerate), etc...

I'm just looking for people to help me test out my mods and my mod tools, since so far nobody has given me any feedback on some of my newer developments :(

My tools also work for SP, but I don't play SP that often (Though my friend is playing insanity mod insanity and it's pretty fun)

Thanks!

I have to say, on the whole /r/MECoOp is a delight to moderate, you are all well-behaved and we continue to provide a fantastic place to hang out and discuss one of the best multiplayers ever produced. But, there are some things we would like to address.

-----------

**(1) Please practice good Reddiquette.**

[Here is a link to the Reddiquette page.](http://us.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) I encourage you all to read this guide. Reddiquette is an informal set of guidelines suggested by other redditors on proper etiquette when using Reddit. The vast majority of it is common courtesy and decency. Everyone is advised to abide by it as best they can, as creating a civil and friendly environment is much preferred to, say, BSN. To that end, you may have noticed that a fair few of our users are now attracting unwarranted downvotes. Whoever is doing this, please stop. The downvote button is not a dislike button. It performs a specific function, that is, to moderate the quality of the subreddit based on the quality of the submission or comment. You are to use it when something contributes nothing to the discussion and/or breaks the rules of the subreddit. Vote on the quality, not on whether you agree with what's being said, or whether you like the person saying it. That goes for upvotes as well as downvotes.

**(2) Please make use of the Report button.**

Again, you guys are very good at pointing other users to the links in the sidebar should they make a post that is answered in the documents and links readily available to them. We also ask that you report any threads or comments which you believe to be breaking our posting guidelines, as this makes our job of dealing with such posts a heck of a lot easier. We're always looking for ways to improve the efficiency of our moderation, and your contribution with this would be swell. You can help us moderate your sub and maintain the high standard of quality here. Do not worry, reports are anonymous. In conjunction with this, please be sure to read the posting guidelines before submitting anything.

**(3) Message the moderators if you have any issues or questions for us.**

We're always open to feedback, and should you have anything you wish to discuss with us regarding the sub, feel free to use modmail to get in touch. If you're unsure of how to do this, if you scroll down the sidebar to the list of moderators, there should be a little message outside the box that says ""message the moderators"". If you click this, it will allow you to send modmail to all of us, where we can discuss the subject of your inquiry with you, with discretion. All of the mods will be able to see it, so we can all pitch in and help you out. We would prefer this method of getting in touch to PMs sent to our personal inboxes, or in public comments in threads.

--------------

That's all for now. Thanks for reading this, we're only bringing these points up so that we may improve the sub for you all. Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

*Update 2/3/2013: Introduced the Two-Key methods, and organized the guide into sections*

***Introduction***

Frustrated because your Human Adept is doing combat rolls instead of reviving the Asari Vanguard? Is running with the pizza too difficult for you?

Unfortunately, ~~thanks to the console peasants~~ because of our console brothers, we are forced to use what we call an *Omnikey*, the One Key to Rule Them All. We dodge, activate, and sprint with one key. It's functional, but it can become much better if the Omnikey was divided.

*This is when I come in to tell you that your sorrows are over!* Great minds of the internet have discovered a way to divide the Omnikey into many different keys! You can divide them into two keys, or divide them into three keys.

***Methods***

* **Two keys** method divide the Omnikey into two keys: Action Key and Use Key. Action Key is used for movements, like Sprinting and Dodging. Use Key is used for using (obviously) objects, such as a hack objective, pizza, and revives. When done manually, this way is much simpler to implement than the three key.

* **Three keys** method divide the Omnikey into three keys: Action Key, Use Key, and Sprint Key. It is identical to the two keys, except that Action Key no longer allows sprinting; instead, that role is given to the Sprint Key. This method is a bit more complex, but it will give you a slight advantage; it will remove the slight delay between your sprinting command and the actual sprint.

**Both methods require [ME3 Coalesced Utility](http://wenchy.net/me3-coalesced-utility/). [If you edited your FOV](http://www.reddit.com/r/mecoop/comments/14b1ek), you should already have this program. Extract it to anywhere you wish.**

* **IMPORTANT: BEFORE YOU DO ANY OF THESE METHODS, BACK UP YOUR OLD COALESCED.BIN.**

How to back up your Coalesced.bin:

1. Navigate to your Mass Effect 3 directory, then open BIOGame, then CookedPCConsole. For me it's at C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Mass Effect 3\BIOGame\CookedPCConsole. You should have something pretty similar.

2. Make a back up of coalesced.bin. Just copy paste coalesced.bin with a different name.

* **Also, please note that every patch will overwrite any changes done to Coalesced.bin, so I suggest you to make a back up of the new Coalesced.bin as well**

***Two Key Method***

There are two Two Key Methods: T-key Method and Squad Attack Method.

* **T-Key Method: Assigns a new key T as the Use Key. The old Omnikey becomes Action Key**

1. Open ME3Coalesced.exe from your extracted files.

2. Click File, then Open. For those with poor computer skills, it looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ORlyS.png).

3. Go to your CookedPCConsole folder and open *coalesced.bin*.

4. After it loads, open *bioinput.ini* tree, then *sfxgame*, then *sfxgamemodebase*. Click on *bindings = (multiple)*. [It should look something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/cE7rJMm.png)

5. Find a line that has *Name=""Shared Action*. If you see my previous picture, mine is the 3rd from the top.

6. Click on it. It should say *( Name=""Shared_Action"", Command=""Exclusive TryStandingJump | Exclusive Used | OnRelease StormOff | OnHold 0.2 StormOn | Exclusive PressAction | OnTap 0.3 TapAction | OnHold 0.3 HoldAction"" )*.

7. Erase *| Exclusive PressAction*. Make sure that there is one space and a line between *StormOn* and *Ontap 0.3*.

5. Scroll down the right side of the program until you get to the very bottom with an open space with an asterisk (* &lt;- this guy) on the left side. [It should look something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/KGig3.png)

6. Click the open space, then copy Paste *( Name=""PC_Use"", Command=""Used"" )*, then press enter.

7. Now on the left side of the program, close the *sfxgamemodebase* tree, and open *sfxgamemodedefault*. Open *00000409* (*NOT 0000040c*) tree, then click on *localizedbindings = (multiple)*. [It should look like this.](http://i.imgur.com/keAEY8c.png)

8. Same as before, click on the blank space next to the asterisk, and copy and paste *( Name=""T"", Command=""PC_Use"" )*.

9. Save, and you're done! Now you can revive and use objects with the T key and Spacebar cannot!

* **Squad Attack Method: Assigns Squad Attack as the new Use Key. Old Omnikey becomes Action Key**

1. Follow Steps 1-7 of the T-Key method.

2. Find *( Name=""SquadAttack""* binding.

3. Click on it, copy and paste *( Name=""Shared_SquadAttack"", Command=""Exclusive Used"" )* into the space, then press enter.

4. Save, and you're done! Now Squad Attack binding (can be reconfigured in the Option Menu in the game) can be used to revive and use objects, and spacebar cannot!

***Three Key Method***

1. Decide the locations of your new keys. Mine is E for Use Key, Left Shift for Sprint, and Space for Action.

2. Start Mass Effect 3

3. Go to Extras, Options, Key Bindings.

4. Bind your *""Use/Cover/Storm""* to your new Use Key (i.e. I binded mine to E).

5. Make sure that your Sprint and Action Keys are not used by anything else. If they are, rebind so that they are no longer used (i.e. Left Shift, my Sprint key, is commonly used by *Command HUD (HOLD)*. I rebinded it to Right Shift.).

6. Back out of your options menu, exit the game.

9. Open ME3Coalesced.exe from your extracted files.

10. Click File, then Open. For those with poor computer skills, it looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ORlyS.png).

11. Go to your CookedPCConsole folder and open *coalesced.bin*.

12. After it loads, open *bioinput.ini* tree, then *sfxgame*, then *sfxgamemodebase*. Click on *bindings = (multiple)*. [It should look something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/cE7rJMm.png)

13. Find a line that has *Name=""Shared Action*. If you see my previous picture, mine is the 3rd from the top.

14. Click on it. It should say *( Name=""Shared_Action"", Command=""Exclusive TryStandingJump | Exclusive Used | OnRelease StormOff | OnHold 0.2 StormOn | Exclusive PressAction | OnTap 0.3 TapAction | OnHold 0.3 HoldAction"" )*.

15. Erase EVERYTHING after *Command=""*, then write (without the period) *Used"")*. It should now say *( Name=""Shared_Action"", Command=""Used"" )*. This turns our old Omnikey into the Use Key.

16. Scroll down the right side of the program until you get to the very bottom with an open space with an asterisk (* &lt;- this guy) on the left side. [It should look something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/KGig3.png)

18. Copy paste this baby (without the period of course): *( Name=""PC_Action"", Command="" PressAction | OnTap 0.3 TapAction | OnHold 0.3 HoldAction"")*. Press enter.

19. Now there's a new blank space with an asterisk. Click on it again, and this time copy past this guy: *( Name=""PC_Storm"", Command=""Exclusive TryStandingJump | OnRelease StormOff | StormOn"")*. [Now it should look something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/tZjU3Rq.png) We just added 2 new keys; the Storm/Sprint Key and the Action Key.

20. Now on the left side of the program, close the *sfxgamemodebase* tree, and open *sfxgamemodedefault*. Open *00000409* (*NOT 0000040c*) tree, then click on *localizedbindings = (multiple)*. [It should look like this.](http://i.imgur.com/keAEY8c.png)

21. Same as before, click on the blank space next to the asterisk, and copy and paste *( Name=""Spacebar"", Command=""PC_Action"")*, but in place of Spacebar, enter your key for Action Key. Press Enter.

22. Repeat 21, but now copy and paste *( Name=""LeftShift"", Command=""PC_Storm"")*, and in place of LeftShift, your Sprint Key. [Now it should look something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/Zuz0d7E.png) Now you have binded two keys to Sprint and Action Keys.

23. Click File, Save. You're done!

***FAQ***

1. Will I get ban- ***Next question.***

2. Bu- ***NEXT QUESTION.***

3. I looked in the guide you linked in the references section, and it didn't mention anything about the first six steps of the Three Key Method. ***That was my own design. When I first made my omnikey, the guide I linked to didn't work. It's kind of obvious now that I think about it; of course your game will get confused if you bind both the Command HUD and Sprint to the Left Shift key!***

4. The game/commands no longer work after I followed your guide! ***Delete coalesced.bin, and restore your back up. If you followed my guide, you would have a back up.***

5. I'm even lazier than that/tl;dr. Can you just upload your Coalesed.bin if we're fine with your keybinding? ***See the download section below.***

6. How does this make pizza running easier? ***Instead of having to mash spacebar in hopes that you don't accidentally start dodging forward, now you can run and spam the Use Key. If you use my custom keys, you should just be running by holding shift while mashing E. Spamming E is quieter and easier than spamming spacebar.***

7. While using the Three Key Method, how do I vault over covers? ***While you are running, double tap your Action Key. You don't need to let go of your Sprint Key as you do this.***

A very helpful person I played with recently linked me to this mod after I played several games with the GI.

What it does is to greatly reduce the intensity of the hunter mode visual effects. [It looks like this.](http://i.imgur.com/YzdRtkZ.jpg)

1358284026.0,46,self.MECoOp,16n25m,ME Co-op College 205: Collectors,52,6,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16n25m/me_coop_college_205_collectors/,"Introduced in the Retaliation patch, the Collectors are widely agreed to be, along with the Geth, the single hardest faction to play against. They are defined by their excellent suppression abilities and their speed. They also have a unique ""Possession"" mechanic, where Harbinger takes over a unit, adding extra defenses and new offensive abilities. Here's the troop layout.

* **Collector Trooper**: The baseline Trooper level unit, and probably the most dangerous one out of all factions. They have health higher than Cerberus and Geth Troopers, and on par with Cannibals. They also have good damage and a very dangerous melee attack. Along with other troopers, they also can throw grenades to flush you out of cover. When possessed, they gain more health and a layer of barriers, along with the ability to create Collector Webs, which block movement in an area.

* **Collector Captain**: The Collector Captain unit, obviously enough. They have a layer of barrier and health, and are more durable than the Troopers. They have damage on par with Marauders, making groups of them very dangerous. They can also make Seeker Swarms, which sneak up on you and explode, blocking your powers for a set period of time and decreasing weapon accuracy, which is extremely annoying and very dangerous. However, when spawning a swarm, the Captain must stand still and sort of collapse over, leaving them wide open for easy headshots. When possessed, they instead create Seeker Plagues, which are bigger, stronger, and will damage you heavily when they explode. For all of these reasons, and for their relatively low health, Collector Captains should usually be your priority target, as without them the faction loses a lot.

* **Abominations**: A buffed Husk, essentially. They cost four times the wave budget, but most people would agree that for the Collectors, they're worth it. They will try to enter a grapple animation with you, popping you out of cover and leaving you wide open for attack from other units. They also explode when killed, which can be avoided by destroying the head-- Bioware's version of the old zombie cliché. This can be accomplished by headshots or certain melees-- Batarians, Slayers, Shadows, and Vorcha Heavy melees all work. In addition, winning a grapple (by pressing the melee button a bunch) also destroys their head, negating the explosion. In other words, if you see someone grappling with a Possessed Abomination, just let them handle it, or else they will hate you forever when you blow up a nuke in their face. Possessed Abominations are the bane of PUGs everywhere, as their explosion radius increases dramatically along with the damage, wrecking grouped teams. Your best bet against these guys is either to destroy the head or use some kind of physics effect power like Throw or Concussive Shot to knock them away from you. Biotic Heavy Melees like Drell or Human Adept/Vanguard can also knock them far enough away (usually). Kill these guys when they're still far away to prevent the danger they pose. Possessed Abominations should often be your #1 priority to kill.

* **Scions**: The Collectors' long range unit. These guys are akin to Ravagers or Rocket Troopers, in that they try and keep you pinned down in cover while the rest of their faction closes in. These guys are very dangerous when shooting at you, but pose almost no danger if they're firing at someone else. For this reason, try and help teammates out by taking out Scions that have them pinned down. Alternatively, if they're far enough away, the shots travel slow enough that you can straight up outrun them by running perpendicular to their flight path (thanks AaronEh). Possessed Scions are the most annoying motherfuckers you will ever meet, as not only do they gain extra armor and shielding, but they also become Cover Busters along with Suppressors, which is a bit broken. They fire clusters of grenades at you that explode much more quickly than normal grenades. Rolling/dodging is about your only hope to get out of the way fast enough. They will stagger you, along with normal Scion shots, so be careful out in the open. Scions are very slow, so if you have to run away from them or get a better position, so be it. Last thing you should know is that if you shoot the sacs on their shoulder, it will stagger them when it explodes, which can help free a squadmate from their sync kill if you're lucky and fast (oh yeah, they can sync kill too, but only after a melee attack).

* **Praetorians**: The single toughest enemy in the game, especially when Possessed. Atlases actually have more defenses you have to rip through, but the Praetorians have a few more things in their favor. First of all, they have the ability to put up a bubble that will block any powers and explosions you throw at them. They can't attack with the bubble up, but they can close in very fast. On that note, Praetorians are about as fast as a Banshee, and would be very hard to hit when moving if they weren't so damn big. Their melee attack is almost always followed by another melee attack, and another, and another, and then a sync kill. These chain staggers is why you *never* want to be close to a Praetorian. They can also execute a gigantic leap attack where they go sailing a ridiculous distance, all the better to chomp you with. If you can shoot the plates on their ""face"" off, they will take more damage when you shoot them there, so keep that in mind. They can also do a long range attack, where they sweep an eye beam across the map vertically, that has a nasty habit of going through cover and is extremely damaging. Possessed Praetorians are by far the tankiest unit in the game, and gain the ability to shoot rockets from their face that will stagger you if they hit. Totally balanced.


**STRATEGY/TEAM COMPOSITION**

Weapons classes are by far the best choice against Collectors, for a few reasons. First of all, tech or biotic explosions against them are bugged to do less damage than they should, making many tech or biotic classes much less good than they are against other factions. In addition, almost every unit is shielded, and *every* unit is shielded when possessed. Biotics are probably your best bet if you're going for power classes, as there are *no* shields, just barriers and armor. For this reason, the Huntress is one of the best classes against them, because of her excellent anti-barrier and anti-armor capabilities, and because she doesn't rely on explosion damage.

Snipers are your best friend against the Collectors. There is a reason that this faction has been called ""Headshot Heaven"". Collector heads are the proverbial barn door; if you can't hit them, you'll probably do worse against any other faction. In addition, every unit has some kind of effect that snipers can exploit. Abominations don't explode when headshotted, and Troopers and Captains have giant heads. Scions can be staggered by shooting out their sacs, and Praetorians can be weakened by shooting off their plates. Infiltrators are fantastic, as are Turians, thanks to their Stability bonuses letting you get easier headshots. Quarian Marksmen with an accuracy build and a shotgun like the Claymore can wreck Collectors, but need a team backing them up. Destroyers and their accuracy bonuses also make for easier headshots.

The TGI deserves his own special section, as he seems almost like a hard counter to the Collectors. His Overload lets you easily strip the barriers of units, and since they are all organic, Neural Shock applies too. His stability bonus lets him get easier headshots. His dodge makes Abominations, Possessed Scions, and Praetorians much less threatening. His insane weapon damage negates much of the danger of the Praetorian bubbles or Seeker Swarms. The TGI and the Huntress are probably the two best choices for putting the Collectors on (relatively) easy mode.

1357717561.0,47,self.MECoOp,168lmh,Why You Should Care For: The Arc Pistol,50,3,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/168lmh/why_you_should_care_for_the_arc_pistol/,"For those veterans who have been around since the beginning, you may be familiar with how the Arc Pistol was viewed. It was down there with the Incisor and Shuriken as being the worst weapons in the game. Low damage, awkward charge mechanism, and high weight all contributed to the weapon's poor performance.

Through a series of buffs however, the current Arc Pistol actually is a solid weapon. Like the N7 Eagle, the Arc Pistol is a generalist weapon that excels on caster classes. Now to examine it in detail.

____________________________________________________

*Why did people not enjoy the Arc Pistol?*

**YOU LIE MR. GUN SIR**- The damage shown on the weapon loadout screen implies you have the weapon charged up and thus is not indicative of how the gun actually works. The Arc Pistol has two firing modes: a high-powered charge (shown on the weapon loadout screen) and a low-powered tap (which does a fraction of the given damage).

**Can't even do one job right**- Because of the two firing modes on the same gun, it's not as efficient in both modes as the guns it is derived from. The Arc Pistol is much heavier than the Predator for lightweight shots while the Carnifex shoots heavy shots much faster than the Arc Pistol.

**That's some heavy plastic**- At the time, the Arc Pistol was heavier than the Carnifex. This made for further disincentive to use the Arc Pistol over the Carnifex for any occasion.

**Batteries not included?**- And to top it off the Arc Pistol has some ammo problems if fired too fast.

So the Arc Pistol earned its hate. Fortunately it received buffs in terms of relative weight and damage that make it a great caster gun.

___________________________________________________

*So why try the Arc Pistol now?*

**The perfect 200%**- Assuming the Rank 4 Capacity upgrade is taken in the class passive, most casters will get a 200% exact, on the dot, cooldown with the Arc Pistol while the Carnifex will grant a 190% cooldown. This allows casters to have both a powerful gun AND great cooldowns.

**It's like Trail Mix, but in gun form**- Like the N7 Eagle, the Arc Pistol can vary from a rapid fire pistol to a heavy-hitting handcannon. This means that a SMG may be redundant as the two modes can help against fast but weak and slow but strong targets, respectively.

**Three times three equals...**- When the Arc Pistol shoots a fully charged shot, it shoots three shots in rapid succession that have a 3.0x damage multiplier. This results in a shot that is 9x stronger than the normal shot the Arc Pistol brings. This is incredibly useful in stunning targets that are getting too close.

_____________________________________________________

*Miscellaneous*

**Mods**- I recommend the Barrel and Capacity mods to get the most out of the gun, as ammo and damage are the most important parts of the gun to buff.

**You only need one gun**- Because it's both the Carnifex and Predator in one gun, odds are you won't need another gun to deal with any other threat. Don't forget to take the Rank 4 Capacity upgrade in the racial passive to get that perfect 200% cooldown.

_____________________________________________________

So that's why I encourage you all to give the Arc Pistol another spin. It's like having two guns at once for a caster and it nails the perfect cooldown at X.

1. There are no current in game fighting models for the Volus, nor would they fit well within the combat system (they wouldn't be able to see over the chest high walls). This is assuming that they'd be able to actually fight in the capacity that is necessary for something like a Vanguard. 
2. Canonically they are essentially unable to provide a military. Being kept off the council and a client race of the Turians because of this inability. You'd expect they could have a similar function as the Salarians if their troops had high quality spec ops soldiers like would be needed for the N7 ops.
3. We don't see a single Volus in the Retaliation trailer. This is a big one, because it's new. We see a Turian, Asari, Quarian, Drell, Geth, Batarian, Vorcha, and Krogan.

That means that 2 of the new things weren't shown in the trailer, the new enemy for the geth and the **four** different classes for the volus. 


While each of these individually could have a valid explanation, when they are all thrown together it seems to me that there will be no Volus classes, and that they are trying to use it as a placeholder to hide what they really are doing. 

To me, that says Protheans. It fits with the Collectors, which was expected before the 1st DLC ever dropped. It explains why there are going to be four extra classes added, which unless you count humans, is more than any single pack has added to a single species. They fit well with the Adept, Engineer, Sentinel, and Vanguard classes, from what we know about them. Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems pretty obvious to me at this point. 

They also said that they'd release classes over time on a regular basis on the blog. So those four classes might coincide with a Single Player DLC to explain it, and not with the initial release of Retaliation.

This information is intended to be helpful to players with moderate skill level that are looking for some ways to improve their play.  For the map-specific tips I have outlined, they apply more to bronze/silver play than they do to gold.  If you are one of the regular posters here that is really good at the game, this probably isn't for you (though I would love if you would leave any tips in the comments).  Much of this has been on the board at one time or another, but I thought it would be helpful to collect this into one place and to add my two cents.  Please let me know if I have made any mistakes, or left out any information - I will update to reflect that.

### Mechanics

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/u9gss/psa_about_spawning_and_wave_budgets/) is one of the reddit threads on spawn mechanics.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgoNSTctMEekdEJZUFQ0R1pid0JsY25QRUZrbE50QlE&amp;output=html&amp;gid=0) is an excellent spreadhseet that has detailed spawn information organized by faction, enemy type, diffuculty, and wave.

The main takeaways from these sources:

* Each wave has a fixed budget (e.g. 640 for silver wave 5) and each enemy has a fixed cost (e.g. 20 for an assault trooper).  Enemies spawn until that budget is depleted.

* Each enemy type has a maximum active at once and maximum total which vary based on the wave and difficulty setting.  For instance, in wave 10 of silver, you should generally never see more than 2 banshees at once (there are apparently rare exceptions), and at most 4 during the wave.  In gold, you'll still see no more than 2 active (still exceptions), but there is no cap on the total number seen in the round.

* Killing an enemy unit will cause it to be replaced by the same type of unit, unless that unit's max limit for the wave has been reached, or the budget for the wave has been depleted.

* Objective waves ignore budgets and will continue to spawn enemies until the objectives are completed, but it does respect enemy-specific limits for that round.

* There are a maximum of 8 enemy units on the map at any given time, excluding turrets, swarmers, and drones.

* Each map has a fixed number of spawn locations, and if possible, the game will avoid spawning new enemies at a spawn point when a player is in close proximity to it.  

* This isn't really relevant to strategy, but the jump in total budget size between bronze and silver is about 78% and between silver and gold it's about 73%.  Budgets for the later waves have a higher relative jump per difficulty, so wave 1 silver -&gt; gold isn't nearly as dramatic as wave 9 silver -&gt; gold.

Given all this information, here are some general tips:

* *When possible, focus on lower tier units.*  Given the budget system and the time it takes to kill enemies, the ""big"" units (banshee, atlas, prime) are the worst value for getting through the wave quickly.  They take proportionally longer to kill than other equivalent units, relative to their budget cost:  

          Reapers:  1 banshee = 1.4 brutes = 1.7 ravagers = 2.9 marauders = 4 cannibals

          Cerberus:  1 atlas = 1.25 phantom = 2.5 engineer or guardian = 3.3 nemesis or centurion = 4 assault trooper

          Geth:  1 prime = 2.5 hunter, pyro, or rocket trooper = 4 trooper

* *Be mindful of spawn locations at the beginning of waves.*  Try to learn where the spawn points are on each of the maps.  (By the way, if anyone has been able to find diagrams that outline all of these, I'd love a link - I've had no luck finding any.).  Knowing where you and your teammates are positioned relative to the spawns should provide a strong predictor of where your enemies will be coming from.

* *Try to block spawn locations.*  This is an extension of the last point, but once you have a sense for where the spawn locations are, you can keep enemies from appearing at certain locations, which in turn can help your team from getting flanked from multiple directions early in the wave.  I will go into more detail on this in the map-specific section.

* *It's okay to retreat.*  When you're swarmed, it often feels like there are more than 8 enemies on the field.  But, if you see six around you, chances are, there's another place on the map where there are two or fewer.  If you're by yourself and you're starting to get overwhelmed, retreat should be a no-brainer.  Go join your teammates or find a better angle to engage the enemies.  If you're with your teammates and still getting overwhelmed, retreat can be a little harder to orchestrate.  With a mic, it's possible to suggest relocation, but without one, you may want to consider a semi-retreat to flank your enemy.  If you run from the center of the action and re-engage from the side, you may be able to draw fire away from your teammates.

* *Killing enemies during some objective rounds can be counterproductive.*  This is particularly true of the device and pizza delivery objectives, as teammates killing enemies on one side of the map may mean there are other ones spawning closer to, or on top of the designated hacker / delivery man.  If you are far away from your teammate doing the objective and killing things without seeing the replacements anywhere around you, chances are it's closer to what you are trying to protect.  Instead, if you are focused on just drawing the fire of the enemies and keeping them away from your teammate, this may be more helpful (at the cost of your precious kill-count).  This is more of an advanced technique, and honestly, if your other teammates are killing things anyway, your pacifism isn't going to be doing much good.  You might just be better off escorting whoever is trying to do the objective (unless it's an infiltrator specced for duration doing devices, a seemingly rare thing these days).

* *Kite enemies during the extraction round.*  This is one of my favorites, especially with Geth.  It's particularly handy when your team decides to camp the EZ, because you can draw a significant portion of the enemies away from them.  The idea is to find a big group of enemies (4-5) near the beginning of the round at one of the spawns, and draw them away from the EZ without killing them.  I recently had a group of 3 pyros and two hunters following me around Dagger on a wild goose chase, leaving only 3 other spare enemies for the rest of my teammates to fight.  I would only recommend this technique if you are capable of surviving solo, though. And, it's really only helpful on a struggling team, as a solid team should be fine just killing everything they see.

* *Use missiles at opportune times.*  If you know exactly where a group of enemies is going to spawn, you can missile a large group at the beginning of some waves.  I wouldn't recommend this with anything other than a very strong group, as you may want to save them for more defensive purposes.  But, at lower difficulties (especially silver), it can be very helpful during a wave 10 objective round.  Since only 4 boss enemies total will spawn during that wave on silver, if you can catch two at a time with a missile, and then 2 more with a later missile, no more will spawn.  This is most useful against banshees, least useful against Atlases.

I was going to do a ""classic"" sniper infiltrator, but because everyone doesn't have the Valiant nor the Black Widow, I'll hold that off for a week or so while I think of some acceptable replacements (so far the Krysae and the Harpoon Gun are on the list). 

Meanwhile, Engineers are more power based and all it needs is just lightweight weaponry. So I give you [this](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#20PPKOAV9N2@A@@N4L4I4H4) while Curtis* the Imaginary Critic pokes some holes in my build that I realize. 

**So you finally gave me a name and I respect that., but you're still crazy for even imagining me just for your own personal gain.**- That hurts so much I'm not sure if I want to continue now.

**Fine, I will avoid personal attacks because that makes me look like an asshole. So why do you have a drone that is as flimsy as cardboard?**- That's because Sally the Suicide Drone wasn't meant to live like that. Combat Drone explosions are capable of detonating Tech Bursts set up from Overload, which means Tech Bursts ahoy. In addition, the Shock and Chain Lightning evolutions are for it to do additional crowd control during her brief existence. The short recharge time helps speed up the process.

**I've noticed that you specced your character for crowd control.**- That is true. On Gold and Platnum, there's a lot of shit on the screen. Plus I'm better at crowd control than nailing a specific target. Fortunately, I have provided an [alternate spec](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#20MLROAV9N2@A@@N4L4I4H4) in case you wanted to do high damage on specific targets.

**Normally you are a proponent of Fitness but this character has no points into it.**- The Engineer has so many good powers that I put points into all of them, and I do a 6/0 in passives because I want to carry something besides a Carnifex and deal good damage. 5/3 is a perfectly acceptable trade-off if you are fine with carrying one weapon.

**I think we can end this peacefully, as I am now used to your throbbing erection for humanity.**- Thank you. Recall that the Combat Drone also serves as a good decoy in times of need, and is a good counter to Guardians and their Nokia-strong shields.

So, go out and try it if you want. Put suggestions and what-not in the comments, and have fun. Don't be an ass like Curtis.

**Hello again, fellow Brogans!** 

Over the past couple of weeks now, we've all (I hope, barring the Random Number Generator &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;) had a chance to play with the ~~Krogan Vanguard~~ MURDERTRAIN. In this time, we, and myself included, have grown more accustomed to what this great class has to offer.  So what will I be going over in this guide you now see before you?

* **New weapons and their strategies**: I'll go over what weapons I've found to be successful, and would recommend over others.
*  **Barrier ""Popping""**: Some of you across MECoOP have probably already seen me suggest this.  I'll go into it a little more in depth, and why I suggest it as a viable strategy.
* **Enemy Strategies**: Brought up in comments on the other thread, I'll go over enemy tactics, and what works best for me, and what I think you should be doing given certain situations.
* **What Equipment you should be bringing**: While I think I've covered this in my first guide, I'll go more in depth on what you should and should *not* be using.

With that, let's get started.

*DISCLAIMER: THIS GUIDE IS BUILT ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT YOU HAVE FOLLOWED MY PREVIOUS GUIDE AND BUILD SUGGESTIONS, LOCATED [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/s73o9/all_aboard_the_murdertrain_or_how_to_krogan/).  I WILL ADDRESS THINGS IN THIS THREAD AS SUCH, SO IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THIS GUIDE PREVIOUSLY, I WOULD SUGGEST YOU DO SO TO GET STARTED.*

****
&gt;**Weapons of the Trade**
****

I've said before that my preferred weapon on the Murdertrain is something from the Shotgun category.  You get a bonus from your sixth tier in ""Battlemaster"", helping you with precious, *precious* Cooldown.  So let's start with:

**Shotguns**
****
**Graal Spike ~~Thrower~~ Death Dealer**: This gets my vote for the most useful of the shotguns in this catgeory. It's easily one of the most damaging shotguns in the game, before and after charging. And, unlike it's charging brother, the Geth Plasma Shotgun (which we'll cover in a moment), *it's capable of* **headshots**. Meaning more points for you and your team.  I'll recommend ammo later in the EQ section.  With the Capacity and Shotgun Reduction upgrades, this shotgun will still be light enough to not restrict you from being a Murdertrain capable of good recharge (even with Barriers up).  One thing to note, is that unlike the Kishock (another charging weapon), **THIS WILL NOT PIERCE THROUGH COVER OR GUARDIAN SHIELDS** with or without armor piercing OR a shredder mod.  Although, it does look humorous seeing spikes gather on a Guardians shield...

**Geth Plasma Shotgun**: The second cousin of the Graal.  This weapon isn't bad by any means, and between the two, I'd say it really comes down to personal preference, or whatever is lighter for you (what weapon rank you have).  But for differences, here we go: The GPS, is capable of MORE damage than the Graal, per charge. The GPS has more ammo per Thermal Clip (5) compared to the Graal (3) BUT the GPS uses **2** shots per charge, where as the Graal uses 1.  You will still be able to get 3 charged shots between either weapon, but if you're looking to shoot without charging, the GPS has more *bang* for your buck (PUNS!).  I prefer the Damage and Clip bonus for the GPS.  I haven't tested this myself, but I've read reports that the shredder mod does nothing on the GPS as well.  The accuracy mod isn't needed, as the GPS has something the Graal doesn't: Psuedo homing shots.  It's not perfect, but depending on the range, it will get the job done.

**Katana/Scimitar**: Both of these shotguns are light, and really up to your preference. And instead, I should compare them between the Eviscerator.  But the two are so light weight, and found early (usually), that's why I'm comparing them here.  Both shotguns are nothing to scoff at.  But the key differences are that the Katana is a semi-auto (you need to pull the trigger for each shot) and the Scimitar is full auto.  Both are fairly accurate, and I would recommend Damage and Accuracy mods on both to try and get longer range shots for both (the Katana especially).

**Eviscerator**: This one I'm doing separately, because for whatever reason, it's on my shit list.  I have more success with the Katana, than I do the Eviscerator, even though the latter is listed as the ""long range"" shotgun.  I don't know.  If it works for you, by all means, us it.  But from personal experience... It's just... *wrong*... And I don't know what it is that makes it that way.  Damage and Accuracy for best use.
****

Moving on from Shotguns, let's look at a couple other options:

**SMGs**:
****

**Hornet**: Long has this been a beloved Vanguard weapon.  And it recently got a buff. HOWEVER; I can't in good conscience recommend this one for our Murdertrain. Only because I prefer having something that will deal with enemies at range (at least medium range), and the Hornet really fails in that regard.  It's dependent on cover to keep recoil from jumping into the stratosphere, and even then, using it as a ranged weapon with burst fire isn't great.  Still, it's a good CQC weapon, but we have options for that.

Well why would I recommend a shotgun over the Hornet? A SHOTGUN is a CQC weapon?  My response to that is I've recommended the Graal, which can BECOME a long range shotgun, and a close range, accurate as hell shotgun.  It's a hybrid weapon, really.  But I digress.

**Tempest**: The bullet hose.  Or at least, it was. Before it was dethroned (next one on the list).  Not the most accurate SMG, but still decent on damage, and great for pray and spray.  If ammo is a concern of yours, take this.  It shouldn't be an issue.  Ammo mods for most fun, take damage and clip reduction for efficiency.

**Geth SMG**: The *new* bullet hose. Accurate as hell. And being the only SMG that can use Ultra Lightweight Materials, the *lightest* SMG.  Take that plus damage or clip reduction for best use. And then laugh til your quad hurts.
****
Pistols are up to preference, but would fit the long range category if you prefer to have something that would hit at range, yet would be light enough to carry with out having to worry about your CD.  The only recommendations I have are:


**Pistols**:
****
**Carnifex**: You know the gun; the Pocket Sniper Rifle. And that's all there is to say about it. Scope and Damage. Simple as that.

**Talon**: If you're lucky enough to have this gun, you should also be familiar with it in the sense that you've seen Guardians use it. It's a Pocket Shotgun.  4 rounds in the Thermal Clip. Much tighter spread than the Shotguns have to offer, and a couple other options the Shotguns don't.  However, I would recommend Damage and Piercing.
****
Assault Rifles and Sniper Rifles should be skipped in my humble opinion.  I'm not saying you can't use them, but they tend to be too heavy for our goals.  If you insist on using an AR, take something light, like the Avenger.  The Mattock is a good secondary choice, or even the Vindicator if that floats your boat.  Anything heavier than that is pushing the boundaries effective Cooldown Management.

It should go without saying; If you plan on using something that isn't a shotgun, take Weapon Damage in tier 6 of ""Battlemaster"".

With weapons out of the way, we press onward!

****
&gt;**Your Barrier and you**
****

The Barrier is a very unique tool.  Since I wrote the guide, I've learned a few unique things about what the Barrier can and can't do once you ""pop"" it (and can say a few things that I now know the answer too):

* It does *not* detonate Biotic Explosions
* It *can* however *setup* Biotic Explosions
* It has a *very* fast Cooldown (Under 2 seconds)
* It has high damage
* It lifts un**armor**ed/non-boss targets
* It kills Husks up to Silver in one burst
* It ***UTTERLY DESTROYS*** Phantom Barriers
* Ravagers seem to hate Barrier bursts (requires further testing)
* It staggers most enemies (non-bosses), I'd say 90% of the time, THROUGH SHIELDS
* It will ALWAYS stagger a Guardian with their shield up, moving the shield aside

The Lift time on Barrier is probably around 2-3 seconds. 4 at the most.  I'm still trying to figure out if there is ""slam"" damage from the fall.  When a target is Lifted, you can use your Biotic Charge to set off a Biotic Explosion (very useful if you specced Radius).

Phantoms are now cake.  Pop Barrier, blast them in the face.  You *could* melee, if you're feeling adventurous.  But this is a OHKO enemy we're dealing with. Be careful.  *Note: Phantoms CAN float away if they have NO barriers up. But just because they're floating away, don't ignore them. Kill ASAP.*

Guardians aren't so difficult either.  Pop Barrier, and watch them stagger to the side, moving their shield.  Shoot them in the face.  If you can get behind them, Pop Barrier, and they fly away.

The best use you will get out of Barrier is AoE (Area of Effect) damage; when you're surrounded.  It's at these times that you should use barrier over Charge for the faster Cooldown. But pick your battles.  Don't use Barrier pops around Pyros.  Use them around Husks, Cannibals, other Squishies (I'll categorize what is Squishie and not later).

Actually, let's do that now.

***CHAPTER 2.1: ENGINEERS***

* The Alliance Navy have a very extensive engineering program that pump out quality engineers, both combat-ready and support, for many years. Cerberus agents stationed there have granted us unparalleled information on their regime.

**Human (Class A)** *Rank: Red*

Engineer recruits from various Alliance Training Centres have, before the Reapers appeared from dark space, focused mainly on supporting their squad against hostile tech, traps and turrets. Nowadays, however, Engineers have moved front-and-centre in the battlefield, taking out turrets and personnel alike.

Originally thought to be a quarian-limited schematic, the human Class-A Engineer carries a Holographic Distraction/Detonation Warfare Device, commonly referred to as a 'Combat Drone'. Operations in various theatres in the galaxy have established that there are two common types of Combat Drones deployed by human Engineers. The first of the two, hereto known as the 'Distraction' Drone, is manufactured to be the fifth ally to the Engineer. Many Cerberus troopers can attest how a losing effort has been turned around by a well-placed Cerberus Mass Accelerator Equipped Armoured Turret, and must be aware when our enemy uses similar tactics. Destroying the Distraction Drone may seem like playing directly into our enemy's hands, but this cannot be avoided. Often carrying tracking explosive missiles, an undisturbed Distraction Drone have executed countless numbers of Cerberus agents.

Unlike the Distraction Drone, the second type of Drone, known as the Detonation Drone, does not stay by the side of the human class-A Engineer, but is created in the midst of enemy platoons. Quick reflexes must be prevalent in order to silence this machine before it wreaks havoc. Detonation Drones replace their missile-like ordnance for a high-voltage discharge that can seize multiple soldiers' muscles for seconds at at time, an eternity in the middle of a firefight. Treat this Drone as a grenade, as upon 'death', it initiates a self-destruct pulse that can react with various tech abilities used by Engineers as a whole.

Human Class-A Engineers also have omni-tools set for two basic programs, known as Incinerate and Overload. Incinerate is a high-explosive plasma projectile that is launched from the Engineer's omni-tool. Dragoon-class units who have not mastered the combat roll will find themselves vulnerable against such techniques. Overload, however, has no projectile and can strip Atlas and Centurion officers' shields as well as Phantom-class specialists' barriers extremely quickly using an immense burst of electrical discharge. Some human Class-A Engineers have focused the electrical current to attack the nervous system, to incapacitate shielded and unshielded hostiles, even through armour's inner insulation. 

Cerberus personnel are advised to stay in cover when hit by either Overload or Incinerate, as a popular strategy with human Class-A Engineers are to take advantage of the programs' energy to cause Fire Explosions and EMP pulses called Tech Bursts. These detonations are similar to Biotic Explosions, in that they absolutely devastate one target and have been known to decimate squadrons in a blink of an eye.

Centurion officers are encouraged to deploy smoke grenades as soon as a human Class-A Engineer is recognized, as Overload and Incinerate relies on the Alliance's patented Hostile Identification and Tracking System Implant. Move through the smoke quietly and come out firing to cause the Engineer to backtrack into a corner.

**Quarian (Class-A)** *Rank:Red*

Much like the volus, quarians have exo-suits that makes them very vulnerable on the battlfield. Unlike the volus, their suits have been combat-approved and streamlined for centuries.

The quarian Class-A Engineer comes pre-loaded with the Incinerate program, much like their human allies. They also managed to balance the white-hot plasma of Incinerate with a wildly different technique, Cryo Blast. This cartridge contains super-cooled particles that can drop the blast radius' temperature to below -100°C within 10 seconds. Unshielded Cerberus soldiers have had their battle armour frozen solid in seconds, only to be shattered by incoming shots. While Cerberus-issued protection has shown to protect the wearer from most of the cold, testing on the hardened armour found on Dragoon protective gear and Atlases have shown that exposing it to extremely low temperatures undermine its shot-blocking abilities. While Cryo Blast is not the most dangerous technique on the battlefield, many casualties were defenseless against follow-up attacks after failing to avoid the icy blast.

Unlike our designs of the Cerberus Turrets, the quarian Class-A Engineer's Sentry Turret is designed to be extremely mobile and mostly automated. Instead of high-RPM bursts, the quarian's Sentry Turret fires large, slow bursts and small, quick shots in alternating patterns. Much like a grenade, the compact Turret can be tossed and needs little to no input from the quarian itself. Incoming fire from an unseen Turret have forced many Cerberus frontlines into oncoming fire from Alliance squads. Many quarian Class-A Engineers also outfit these Turrets with devastating flamethrowers, causing mayhem and panic in even the most disciplined platoons and revealing Cloaked Phantom operatives. 'Guardian' shield carrying personnel must take note that these Turrets can also be carrying armour-piercing ammunition that can punch through the shield with astounding frequency.

The quarian Class-A Engineer offsets their susceptible exo-suits with powerful shield generators, making their enemies expend most of their energy taking that down without affecting the quarian itself. Remember the fight is not over simply because the quarian takes cover after the shields have been drained.

**Salarian** *Rank: Red*

These aliens have kept themselves relevant in intergalactic relations due to their staunch dedication to technological advancement. When engaging a salarian Engineer, never rely on a glitch or malfunctioning omni-tool to grant you a reprieve to turn the tide of the fight, it will not happen. 

Incinerate is the most common program running on their omni-tools, freeing up precious resources and time for the salarian Engineer to focus on the other two devices they bring to the field. One unique to their species, the program 'Energy Drain' has, so far, slipped through Cerberus' intel nets due to the salarian's dubious extranet policies and planetside networkings. What we have found out is the basic premise of the program, though initial prototypes have yet to have the desired effects. The program infiltrates the salarian's adversary's omni-tool's firewall programs and diverts their shield generator's power to the omni-tool's emitter. This is then encoded by the program itself, and broadcast in a fraction of a second. This energy-laced broadcast is then picked up by the salarian Engineer's omni-tool and sent to its shield generators. Depending on the target, the salarian can drain so much power that its own shield produces a Tech Armour-like layer of protection to reduce the devastation of small-weapons fire.

When faced with insurmountable enemies, the slippery salarian Engineer can also produce a holographic body double into the field. Simply known as a 'Decoy', the copy resembles and imitates the movements of the salarian, and can be easily mistaken for the real thing in the cacophony that is a firefight. It is not advised to approach the Decoy, as most salarian Engineers charge it with enough electrical difference to jump from it to enemies.

Salarians themselves are very thin and weak indivdaalifjj...ifdaj-__....

**TOTAL SYSTEM REBOOT INITIATED** ...

**COMPLETED**

**Geth** *Rank: Red*

Ever since the quarian's reacquisition of Rannoch, Cerberus have faced the Alliance's newfound ally of sythentic beings known as geth. They've been known to operate at full-platoon consensus capacity despite only a single geth being on the battlefield. 

The geth engineer has modified its optics to switch to a 'Hunter Mode' where, within certain ranges, it detects threats based on heat and electrical discharges. This enables it to spot threats, both organic and synthetic, through obstacles such as walls and floors. This also renders our smoke grenades fairly useless, but Centurion officers' are still encouraged to deploy them, since our own helmet optics can see through our chemical blend of smoke and the geth Engineer's allies might not be so lucky. Aside from this, Hunter Mode also sends power directly into the geth's weapon and omni-tool, drastically increasing pellet velocity and program lethality. Some geth Engineers have diverted this power surge to their legs, enabling them to move quickly on the battlefield, despite still seeming to walk at a normal pace.

The geth Engineers employ specialized Turrets very similar to the quarian Class-A Engineer's. Intelligence has yet to determine which came first, but first-hand experience have given us the features of it. The Geth Turret uses pulse-based projectiles, flamethrowers and can be thrown like the quarian's Sentry Turret, however the geth Engineer tends to deploy it near itself. The Turret has a specialized emitter that can send overcharged signals directly into its and allies' shield generators, completely restoring them within a set radius. 

The last program on its omni-tool is the commonly seen Overload. While devastating shield generators and barriers, this leaves a flamethrower-less geth Engineer vulnerable to armoured Dragoon-class soldiers and Atlas exoskeletons. Assault Troopers, Centurions and Guardians are encouraged to destroy any Geth Turret they see in order to give their Dragoon allies an unheeded advance against the geth Engineer. 

The geth's main defence is highly advanced shielding technology, enabling the brittle synthetics to stand up to sustained fire. In order to take down said shields, frag grenades must be thrown in order to separate the Engineer from its shield-restoring Turret. Spread out when facing the geth Engineer, to minimized Overload's jumping capabilities, and be prepared to put multiple clips in order to drop the shields and the geth itself.",[Story Time],False,self,t5_2tkk1,1376369909.0,,Xbox,True,t3_1k8lwz,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1k8lwz/the_official_cerberus_handbook_chapter_21/,

As I finish the Citadel DLC, I reflect back on my experiences.

Let me tell you my story of this past amazing, tear-filled, fist-pumping, ""OH SHIT"" filled year.  

A year and a day ago, ME3 launched.  My personal ME experience started 2 weeks before - when my friend lent me the original mass effect.  I was blown away.  One thing led to another, which included: buying all the DLCs, 100% ME1 and ME2, and preordering ME3.  And then it launched.

The aftermath of the ending.  the horror.  One of my friends STILL won't play SP or MP because of the ending.  But one thing kept me to ME3 - the CoOp.

I've been here (on the subreddit and on the game) since the beginning.  The first MP DLC, Resurgence.  Murdertrain fuck yeah.  Geth awesomeness.  Rebellion launches.  Still badass because it's free.  

Summer comes and goes.  I get my first girlfriend.  As most of you know, this turns out horribly.

Earth launches.  School starts.  The user lists launch, and my xbox account is constantly flooded with friend requests and party invites.  I remember a time when I had almost no friends, and I would send the invites.  Nice to see the other side.  The massive-ass term paper looms.  Retaliation launches.  After thinking of leaving MP, I renew my efforts in playing.

I learn my GF is cheating on me.  

I turn the paper in.

Reckoning launches.  And the fun begins again.  

Thanks for an amazing year /r/MECoOp.  From the highs (I was almost a mod!) to the lows (the awkward months between DLC releases) and the all around good times (too many to count). 

So thank you, to everyone.  From the most secretive lurker, to the biggest mods.  

I should go.

1362067365.0,43,self.MECoOp,19efw8,The Iron Giant - Geth Juggernaut,45,2,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19efw8/the_iron_giant_geth_juggernaut/,"First off, this build is not going to put you on the top of the scoreboard. This build is mainly for support and cover, sacrificing damage output to do so. I use the Juggernaut to assist my teammates, not go solo, Terminator-style. Stick with your teammates. 

[Here is the build](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/GethJuggernaut/LODHR/Lancer1BF5AD5////StrongholdPackage5/)

**Powers**

**Hex Shield Rank 6:** I took Pulse at rank 4, Shock at rank 5, and Large Shield at rank 6. Pulse and Shock are for CC in close quarters, while Large Shield really helps block choke points and gives teammates something larger to hide behind. Its main utility in my experience is blocking Ravager salvos, Atlas shots, and Cerberus turrets. I also pop one down in front of a downed teammate to give them some cover while they get up.

**Siege Pulse Rank 6:** Radius at rank 4, Damage Protection at rank 5, and Number of Shots at rank 6. This is to give you some extra survivability while also giving you a good long-range CC. Radius is to take down groups of Husks or Abominations to keep them from getting too close. Damage Protection and Number of shots enhance your durability further, letting you distract more enemies for your teammates to take down. Note that this power also detonates Tech Combos. I'm not sure how powerful of a detonator it is yet, but it seems to be a pretty good one so far.

**Geth Turret Rank 3:** I prefer to keep the turret at rank 3 for some quick shield-boosting without taking more points away from other areas. There is certainly an argument to be made for putting more points into it, but I prefer just three ranks. That said, this is a vital skill. Just revived a teammate? Be a good medic and pop the turret to give 'em some shields. Remember that setting up a new turret resets the shield-boost cooldown, so you can spam turrets to keep your teammates' shields up. Remember that the only limit to how far away you can send it is your own knowledge of how to calculate its arc. The arc is very shallow and easy to predict, so if you're new to it just set up a bronze solo on a map with long sight lines and get some practice in.

**Geth Juggernaut Rank 5:** Weapon Damage, Stability and Ammo Capacity. The Juggernaut doesn't have the kind of powers where you'd want higher weight capacity or increased power damage. This guy is a Soldier, not an Adept. Increased stability and ammo capacity help pretty much every weapon in one way or another. More weapon damage is always a plus, also.

**Hardened Platform Rank 6:** Durability all the way. I've heard arguments for taking Squad Command, but in my opinion, 10% increase to allied damage within 4 meters is *not* worth sacrificing a *75% bonus* to shields and health. Likewise, the 15% damage dealt penalty from the durability upgrade at rank 6 is well worth the extra shields. This turns you into a walking, talking bullet sponge, whose lack of fucks to give is so powerful that every enemy on the map notices it.

**Weapons** I've been flip-flopping between the Lancer and the Typhoon for a bit now. The Lancer frees you from ammo boxes and is lighter, letting you take a second weapon, or just giving you faster cooldowns, letting you use Siege Pulse more offensively or spamming Hex shield/Geth turret more. However, it doesn't have the sustained-fire or damage capabilities of the Typhoon, which also comes with innate piercing. I notice that I tend to visit the ammo boxes pretty frequently while using the Typhoon, however. Both are good choices, it's just more dependent on how you prefer to play.

**Strategy**

You are a big, strong robot. You are *not* a strong, independent robot that don't need no team. That said, you're also not one of those pansy robots that says ""Oh my!"" in a British accent whenever danger appears. Your teammates are your DPS. Your job is to protect them and make sure they can pour uninterrupted streams of fire into the enemies currently attempting to down you. However, BE SMART and DO NOT RELY COMPLETELY ON YOUR HEAVY MELEE TO TANK. Taking on two Banshees is  awesome and badass, but when a pair of Marauders and a Brute show up, you're going to have a really bad day. Pick your battles. Try to isolate a few bosses and, depending on your level of comfort with tanking those bosses, either let your teammates deplete the remaining spawn budget while you keep those bosses occupied, or let your teammates whale away on the bosses while they, in turn, whale away on you. In some cases, the amount of damage being caused to you will be more than the amount of shields you can replenish via heavy melee. DO NOT FORGET ABOUT OPS PACKS. Do not be afraid to use an Ops Survival Pack to help you get through a particularly rough part. Use your heavy melee as a sort of Stasis as well, freezing Phantoms, etc for teammates to shoot at. Plus you can rotate the camera freely while doing heavy melee, so you can get some *badass* screenshots.

On objective waves, your job varies depending on the objective.

**1234 Devices:** Put a shield up in front of the person activating the device and then move away so as not to draw fire to them.

**Hack Circle:** Put up a shield wherever the enemy fire is thickest, and keep refreshing it to new positions when needed. Use Siege Pulse to clear out low-level mooks that get too close (Husks, Cannibals, Troopers, etc.) Keep your team alive and make sure you have a turret down at all times. In fact, spam that sonuvabitch. Make your teammates sick of hearing that zzzZZ sound it makes when replenishing shields. They'll thank you for it later. Revive downed teammates, and try to make sure the enemies are shooting at the giant robot, not the fragile organics.

**Escort:** Spam turret, stay within circle. Pretty simple.

**Retrieve: DO NOT FUCKING TAKE THE PIZZA. YOU ARE A ROBOT. YOU DO NOT EAT PIZZA. PIZZA IS FOR FRAGILE ORGANICS.** Just had to make sure that was visible. In all seriousness, let someone faster take the pizza while you lead the enemies around in a different area. If you *have* to take the pizza, move by sidestepping or backpedaling. You'll go faster.

**Assassination:** Standard, no different than assassination objective with any other kit. Shoot at the little blue diamond.

I think that about covers everything I can think of, I'll leave off with some miscellaneous notes about things I've noticed after playing him extensively since the release.

**Miscellaneous Notes:**

1. He is not immune to stagger. He can be staggered by bosses on Gold and Platinum. However, I've found that he *is* immune to stagger while a.) just before, during, and just after his heavy melee cycle and b.) while he is moving sideways (strafing). I noticed this while kiting a pair of Banshees on Platinum. Normally their melee staggers him, but when I started sidestepping (They were attacking from my right side) he no longer got staggered by their melee strikes.

2. Initial ""pulse"" of heavy melee may detonate tech combos. I'm not sure about this one yet, but on several occasions I appear to have detonated fire explosions when beginning my heavy melee cycle. 

3. His heavy melee appears to have a minimum range. That is, I've noticed being unable to HM phantoms, husks, etc when they get right up in my grille with their swords. I have to back away a bit first and then it will Force choke them.

4. Prime cannons appear to be able to penetrate Hex Shield. I've been standing rather far away from my shield when a Prime started firing, and the shots still connected.

5. Hex Shield blocks Ravager shots, but it does *not* block their explosion. You will still receive damage from the shot if you're standing within about 2-3 meters of the shield when it gets hit.

6. My personal observations with respect to tankability are based off of Gold/Platinum and generally without ""top-notch"" equipment such as cyclonic mods, so they might not hold as true for others. for example, you would probably be able to tank two Gold Banshees as well as a Brute and two Marauders if you were using a Cyclonic III/IV. I never get cyclonics in packs so I wouldn't know. :c

7. Don't let packs of Phantoms get close. They'll still ruin your day.

8. If you're playing with another Jugg, don't forget to request the highest of fives via light melee. (His light melee looks like a high-five.) If another Jugg is not around, your turret buddy is always willing to give you the highest of fives.

That's all I can think of right now, if I remember something or notice something new, I'll post an edit.

Edit: From looking at the class builder, apparently the -15% damage from the rank 6 durability evolution of Hardened Platform also affects the Geth Turret's damage output and Siege Pulse's damage. Not sure if that's intentional or if it's a kink with the builder. Still worth it, in my opinion.

What I didn't know is that a single cast of Chain Overload can detonate up to THREE (!) Fire Explosions. Just last night I was experimenting with a Vorcha Sentinel and using Flamer for the first time, spec'd for range and damage, and was setting things on fire everywhere. My girlfriend was playing a Human Engineer for the Overload points and had that set for one jump and shield damage. We quickly discovered that once I'd lit up a batch of enemies, she could cast Overload on one, getting the expected explosion, and then it would jump and cause  *another*  one a moment later. The results were amazing. I would run in and light everything on fire, then one overload and it all dies. Anything that somehow survives can be Wolverine'd with a quick heavy melee, and the Engineer's Combat Drone is good for getting enemies to hold still to be barbecued.

On monday I was playing with 3 friends, only unknown/unknown/gold. N7 based matchmaking was on holiday, I guess, because a fourth player joined:

* N7 **9**
* **Drell Adept level 9**
* Pulse rifle + smg

My friends wanted to kick, but I thought this was too good to pass. Let's carry a 9 to gold victory. Paying my debts because I was carried to victory back when I had N7 40 or 50 (still searching any/any/any ;-)).

God damn I had a lot of revives, on 2nd wave I had my gold medal for 15 revives, and not only because of the Drell, our Vorcha was also going down quite often (but he was taking down Primes at close range so I thought it was ok). 

It wasn't an easy match, but so incredibly rewarding. At times I thought .. um, the Drell is in front of a prime light meleeing it .. wow.

Scores were 90k, 90k, 90k ... 20k. Took 35 minutes to win. Unfortunately full extraction was not to be, since come wave 11 the Drell bolted to the LZ. My time was basically spent running from corpse to corpse, good thing I was playing the perfect class for this: Femquarian Infiltrator w/ Paladin and cloak specced for extra power while cloaked.

Powers:

Lash - This essentially Pull on steroids. At its rank 6 upgrade, you can let it bypass barriers and shields, which makes it very useful. It can also set off biotic detonations on grabable enemies.

Rank 4 - Increase damage by 30% or Increase force and damage of Biotic explosions by 50%

Rank 5 - Increase recharge speed by 35% or do an additional 100% damage over 10 seconds

Rank 6 - 35% chance of no cooldown + increas the timeframe that lifted targets can be detonated by 100% or Penetrate through shields and barriers, lifting any target without armor but with reduced force

Smash - This is the power you've seen in the trailers. You pull out your biotic whips and smash the enemies in front of you. Very effective Phantom killer. You can also upgrade it to set up for biotic explosions or tech bursts, while it can set off both. However, it has a slow startup time and leaves you vulnerable for a few seconds.

Rank 4 - Add a biotic effect to a target that an be detonated, increase damage by 30% or Add an electrical effect that can be detonated, increase damage by an additional 50% over 7.5 seconds

Rank 5 - Increase force and damage by 40% or Increase recharge speed by 40%

Rank 6 - Increase effectiveness against barriers and armor by 75% or Increase impact radius by 50%, increase # of targets hit by 1.

Then we've got Biotic Charge, and you guys already know how that one works.

Now, these guys work extremely well up close, and can potentially be another glass cannon class. They can dish out tons of damage, but they go down very easily. So it's advisable to use fitness to upgrade durability. (You could also upgrade melee damage to be more of a glass cannon)

Their melee is very useful too. Their tap melee is the shock baton that the assault troopers and centurions use, and it does a fair amount of damage. Their heavy melee is where it really does shine though. They pull out their whips and hit everything in a circle around them. It's not the strongest, but you can easily stagger crowds or use it right after charging.

They have a fairly low weight limit, so those who want to bring a shotgun while maintaining a +200% recharge speed (which you need for this class to be really effective) may want to invest their points into weight reduction. (Their rank 6 Phoenix training has a 25% weight reduction on pistols and shotguns) Also, try to avoid carrying heavy sniper rifles and/or assault rifles.

I'm sure that people will come up with multiple playstyles, but so far I'm having the most fun spamming lash and smash, while throwing the occasional melee and charge in. With this, you can deal out a metric shit-ton of damage, but you may go down a lot if you're not careful.

Well, that wasn't a perfect guide, but it should give you a pretty good example of how the Ex-Cerberus Vanguard works.

I know how great the SI is, but people are playing QI all wrong, when they're playing it at all. How do you play it correctly? Sabotage everything!

Sabotage is now crazy good after the buff, and it's better against organics than synthetics! If you take Backfire and tech vulnerability (100% bonus), with all power bonuses in the passive, it does between 1800-2400 damage from cloak (90% bonus) on non synthetics after 1.5 seconds. I'm not sure how the two bonuses are applied (additive or multiplicative), but it does tons of damage. It's effective against all forms of protection, and it's ridiculous. It takes massive chunks off brutes, ravagers, and banshees. 

The reason why most people won't want to play it?

You will hardly ever place first, because deaths caused by sabotage give no experience unless you have already damaged them with something else. They just die from their own weapon. No credit to you. However, anyone who isn't trying to show off their E-peen can really benefit from this.

It's a great support class too, because 
(1) tech vulnerability gives 100% bonus to everyone else's tech powers on the same target, making a QI + engineer team as good as a biotic explosion team against brutes and banshees. Tech burst + tech vulnerability bonus.
(2) You're still an infiltrator and can do objectives and revive teammates
(3) You can also hack geth, turrets and atlases, though only for 10 seconds.

Build
Cloak:Damage/either/either (I prefer bonus power, but if you want to snipe the other is great too. I like being able to sabotage anywhere at any time from cloak with out worrying about dying.
Sabotage: Backfire, explosive hack (for geth), tech vulnerability
Passives: Power damage and health/shields

Every cannibal was replaced by 10-20 husks and every maurader and every ravager is replaced by 20-30 husks. This translates into THOUSANDS of husks.

This was honestly the most fun i've ever had playing ME3. 

The first time this happened was on hydra and we didn't know this would happen, and we had a Drell Adept with a Paladin and a Salarian Engineer with a Saber (useless weapons against all the husks). Me and the other random were turian soldiers, him with the revenant and me with a striker. The soldiers were the backbone while the adept just rained down multiple cluster grenades (hydra gave us 2 nades per ammo crate, so it was easy to pull this off). The engineer was kind of useless though. Energy drain wasn't very good because only banshees had barreirs. The decoy only attracted like 4 husks out of the hundreds mobbing us. The proximity mines we laid out with the radius buff was really good out wipping out alot of them. We also had concussive shot when they got close. 

The next game it happened again and this time we were ready. The engineer switched to an asari adept and the drell adept switched to a tempest. The drell laid down area reaves and the asari spammed throw. Wiped out alot of husks with biotic explosions. I switched to a Batarian Soldier with Ballistic blades with cone/range/explosion. This time we won.

If this happens to you, here are some hints:

If you're in the open, never stop running till you get to a point you can funnel the husks. If you stop in the open, the husks will stun lock you to death. If you run, they can't stun you.

If a husk grabs you, you're screwed. The time it takes to throw them off takes long enough that you'll get completely surrounded and most likely die. You're best bet is to call for help from a teammate.

Banshees and Brutes are ten times more terrifying, because running from them is way harder with all the husks slowing you down. If anyone is about to get assasinated. Rocket immediately, being a man down will instantly mean you will lose. 

Grenades are great to just throw at your feet to wipe them out. And because you will be running around alot, getting more isn't hard. Cluster grenades are especially great get out of jail free card.

Only use Full-auto SMGs or ARs. Shotguns, snipers, pistols are good at only taking out one strong enemy with their power and limited ammo.

I think that Pantsonhead719 and ImnotaSWfanboy will do a much better job than I will in the coming months. I am stepping down so I can give three new mods an opportunity to experience what I have. 

I would like to thank carbon107 for giving me this opportunity to regulate such a great community, and I would like to thank each and every one of you who ever read on of my posts, commented in my threads ect ect. 

I am stepping down because I have a lot of things going on at the moment. My mother is undergoing chemotherapy at the moment, and my father has just come back into my life after several years inside. I have gotten a recommendation for a job promotion and im in the process of looking for houses to live in. I just simply cannot give the time I once did into playing video games and regulating a community I love. Unfortunately, I have been letting my personal life affect my duties as moderator. As some of you may have seen that somewhat over the top rant, you will see what I am getting at. I don't want something like that to happen again. I offended some, and I acted inappropriately, and to anyone concerned, I apologise.

I would like to give a special shoutout to exxtrooper and InterwebNinja here, they are two people who I have met online, and two people I would consider very good people and friends, and who have listened to my ramblings with no hesitation. Thank you both. 

I have also met some great people on here too. Blackmarketdolphins, ImaDiva-47 and that guy I could never connect too (I don't remember his reddit username off the top of my head) are just three people of many who I have spent many hours playing with. 

I wish the best of luck to RepublicanShredder, ImNotaSWfanboy and Pantsonhead719 to continue where I left off.

1344598301.0,42,self.MECoOp,xzps1,Idea for DLC: Geth Pack!,66,24,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/xzps1/idea_for_dlc_geth_pack/,"This is a random idea I had last night and decided to write up. I present to you six new geth classes, two new maps and three weapons in: the Retribution Pack!


The geth are a humanoid race of networked AIs that were created by the quarians 300 years ago as tools of labor and war. Having since won their freedom from their creators, the geth have been proven to reason, analyse situations, and deploy tactics as well as any other organic race so long as they stay networked with other geth.


Geth Juggernaut (Soldier):

* Distortion Rocket (Tech ability, fires small projectile that causes splash damage over a wide area. Detonates tech bursts.)
* Consensus (Shield, accuracy and damage boosts, bonuses increase by 20% whenever another Geth has this ability or Hunter Mode turned on in the same match. Bonus increases do not stack with more than two geth.)
* Chain Grenades (Grenades that produce an arcing electrical effect like some of the evolutions for Overload. Normally affects synthetics. Can be upgraded to affect organics. Primes tech bursts.)
* Networked AI
* Advanced Hardware

-Shields 1000/1000
-Geth Hop
-Decreased Stamina
-Shield Pulse

A more resilient geth unit, the Juggernaut is designed to excel against large numbers of enemies. As networked AIs, geth units fight more effectively when several work in proximity.


Geth Eradicator (Sentinel):

* Shock (Similar to Warp, but with tech damage. Sets up tech bursts.)
* Consensus (Shield, accuracy and damage boosts, bonuses increase by 20% whenever another Geth has this ability or Hunter Mode turned on in the same match. Bonus increases do not stack with more than two geth.)
* Flechette Armor (Geth equivalent of Tech Armor. Slows down power recharge. Fires spikes over 360 degree radius when detonated. Causes minor bleed damage.)
* Networked AI
* Advanced Hardware

-Shields 1000/1000
-Geth Hop
-Decreased Stamina
-Shield Pulse

The Eradictor excels in combat against organic enemies, as its flechettes shred armor and pierce flesh. As networked AIs, geth units fight more effectively when several work in proximity.


Geth Blaze (Infiltrator):

* Tactical Cloak
* Consensus (Shield, accuracy and damage boosts, bonuses increase by 20% whenever another Geth has this ability or Hunter Mode turned on in the same match. Bonus increases do not stack with more than two geth.)
* Flamer
* Networked AI
* Advanced Hardware

-Shields 750/750
-Geth Hop
-Decreased Stamina
-Shield Pulse

The Blaze is built to move behind enemy positions undetected, before unleashing a powerful blast of flame. As networked AIs, geth units fight more effectively when several work in proximity.


Geth Technician (Engineer):

* Shield Pylon (Deployable pylon. Boosts shields of nearby players. Cannot be deployed at the same time as Assistance Drone.)
* Consensus (Shield, accuracy and damage boosts, bonuses increase by 20% whenever another Geth has this ability or Hunter Mode turned on in the same match. Bonus increases do not stack with more than two geth.)
* Assistance Drone (Similar to Tactical Drone. Applies accuracy boosts and more damage to all teammates within range. Drone will follow player who spawned it. Cannot be deployed at the same time as Shield Pylon.)
* SPECIAL ABILITY: Increases speed of devices and hack circles.
* Networked AI
* Advanced Hardware

-Shields 750/750
-Geth Hop
-Decreased Stamina
-Shield Pulse

Geth Technicians are masters of support, deploying drones and pylons to assist teammates in firefights. As networked AIs, geth units fight more effectively when several work in proximity.


Geth Exterminator (Adept):

* Throw
* Consensus (Shield, accuracy and damage boosts, bonuses increase by 20% whenever another Geth has this ability or Hunter Mode turned on in the same match. Bonus increases do not stack with more than two geth.)
* Shove (ability that staggers an enemy backwards. Works on health and armour by default, with an evolution to make it work on shields and barriers. Fairly small cooldown, but not so much that it can be spammed.)
* Networked AI
* Advanced Hardware

-Shields 750/750
-Geth Hop
-Decreased Stamina
-Shield Pulse

Mimicking the abilities of organic biotics, the geth have built prototype units fitted with reserves of eezo. These Exterminators have been programmed to toss and fling foes like conventional biotics. As networked AIs, geth units fight more effectively when several work in proximity.


Geth Annihilator (Vanguard):

* Biotic Charge
* Consensus (Shield, accuracy and damage boosts, bonuses increase by 20% whenever another Geth has this ability or Hunter Mode turned on in the same match. Bonus increases do not stack with more than two geth.)
* Slam
* Networked AI
* Advanced Hardware

-Shields 1000/1000
-Geth Hop
-Decreased Stamina
-Shield Pulse

Mimicking the abilities of organic biotics, the geth have built prototype units fitted with reserves of eezo. Annihilator platforms charge into hostiles, knocking them to the ground. As networked AIs, geth units fight more effectively when several work in proximity.


Maps:

* Firebase Remnant (City on Rannoch. Wide open map, similar to London or Goddess.)
* Firebase Orbital (Geth space station near Perseus Veil. Small map, similar to Glacier. Lots of small corridors between larger rooms.)


Guns:

* Geth Plasma Pistol: Similar to Arc Pistol, only fires charged shots. Firing rate is rapid, but relatively small ammo capacity. Gold level.
* Adas Anti-Synthetic Rifle: Same as in Firefight Pack. Ultra-Rare level.
* Blood Pack Punisher: Same as in Firefight Pack. Gold level.

The Retribution Pack will also change various details, including:

* A mention of how the medi-gel used to revive geth contains restorative nanobots.
* Damage screens for geth changing to flickering HUDs and electronic noises instead of blood.
* Change in dialogue from ""Cover this one!"" to ""Cover this unit!"" (that always bugged me, that's hanar speech patterns).
* That goddamn bug where you can fire the Reegar and a power at the same time.


And that's all! Let me know how you like it, what changes you'd make, etc.




EDIT: Okay, summary of major changes:

* Tougher Vanguard.
* Decided Lift was overpowered, no matter what I did with it, so replaced with Shove. I'm not surprised they ditched it for ME1.
* Nerfed Consensus so that it doesn't result in ME3 Multiplayer turning into Geth-o-rama.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1344621730.0,,Reaper,True,t3_xzps1,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/xzps1/idea_for_dlc_geth_pack/,

Since the weapons/characters/equipment/mods packs are entirely random, one can not just buy all the weapons in the game. All weapons can be ""bought"" with time or grind playing the game itself. However, there are many people who can't afford the time to grind for all those weapons. Their money is less valuable than their time, so they buy packs. These people have subsidized at least 3 new FREE DLCs for the multiplayer. 

It's an interesting model. Those that can afford to pay do, and everyone reaps the benefit. A pack might help you get a slightly better weapon or a new character, but it doesn't break the game for those not paying in any way. I was incredibly biased against micro transactions before this game, but I have to give bioware/EA credit where it is do. This is a profitable system for them and it's increased the content in our multiplayer at least 2 fold. 

This system has given us 9 maps, 24 characters, 9 weapons, dozens of new mods and gear, changing the way the game works by adding in new types of gear, weekly balance changes, new difficulties, new abilities, etc. for free.

There are many complaints about the packs because you can't just buy specific weapons/characters/etc. But, can anyone else think of a better system that would get us all this extra content basically for free for most players? We have the wealthy players who have less time helping the less wealthy players in this model. This seems much preferable to the standard map pack bull shit, which would easily see our community fractured.

I tested the Quarian Infiltrators Sabotage build vs. Reapers today, and it is ridiculously powerful. We had a couple of maps with 2-3 Quarian Infiltrators specced for Sabotage backfire and 1-2 Engineers in the team. (It's important to take +100% tech damage and increased damage on Sabo).

This setup is easier and faster than FBWGG. Sabotage is so brokenly overpowered against reapers it's not funny. Granted, you won't get xp for Sabo kills but doesn't matter if you have level 20 or just want the credits. You can actually handle reapers without firing any shots - just sabotage them, and if you have an engineer use incinerate for massive damage.

Playing is simple. Spec the cloak for ""Fire 1 power in cloak"", and shoot first sabo immediately after cloaking. This way with 200% cooldown you can shoot two sabotages each cloak cycle. Then just watch the enemies melt down.

Just try it. 

PS. Some might think: why Reapers? Sabo will hack synthetics like Geth or Cerberus turrets / atlases, and that will ruin the whole show.

1346620829.0,43,self.MECoOp,z8wp1,Outclassed Classes and how to get the most out of old favorites and old not-so-favorites.,48,5,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/z8wp1/outclassed_classes_and_how_to_get_the_most_out_of/,"All classes are not made equal. As the number of classes has grown over the past half year, it was inevitable that some classes would receive some overlap. This has the unfortunate effect of throwing some classes under the bus, as there seems to be no reason to consider using them. This is a simple exploration of some classes that are considered to be directly outclassed by new classes, and how/why they can be viable at higher difficulties. This will be a long read. 

**Quarian Female Engineer**

*Why is it outclassed?*

* With three powers that have very limited usefulness, especially against shields, the QFE was bound to have problems. Most damaging was the introduction of her male counterpart with Tactical Scan basically functioning as a better Cryo Blast (with a lower cooldown, highlight targets for better team cooperation, better damage bonus, and similar slow effect), and the best, most versatile grenade in the game to date along with the shared Incinerate. It was able to pull the same support debuffs, with better versatility towards all enemy groups.

*How to fix it?*

* Cryo Blast has a sizable armor debuff. Usually, this isn't that helpful, as most players will already set their weapon around this limitation, whether that is a high damage per shot weapon or with AP ammo or a mod. A fully specced cryo blast will add an extra 25 damage per shot against armored targets, which usually isn't a sizable amount for the most common weapons on Gold and Platinum. There is a way to take advantage of this; Shotguns. Shotguns get that bonus for each pellet for a damage boost against armored targets to 200 for each pull of the trigger. Even on the Claymore this is a 16% damage increase against armor. On the Talon I, its a 76% increase. This allows to maximize weapon damage, and make the class a monster against Reapers.

*Builds*

http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#21NARNRq9@0@A@@@0@0@0@0

* This is focused on debuffing armor, and dealing damage with the Piranha. The Piranha is really, really good, so it's easy to get caught up in just saying the gun is good, but it takes the most advantage of Cryo Blast's armor debuff. It gets an extra **500 dps** against armored targets. Although any shotgun, or even the Hurricane can take great use of it. Since all damage is done by the weapon, focused on those evolutions. Turret is useful as a distraction and for some token damage.

or

http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#21DKRIRS0@0@A@@Z4I4@0@0

* This is a bit more power based with Incinerate. So a high level piranha, Talon (with ULM), or Hurricane is important. Plays similarly to the other one, but also incorporates Incinerate for burst damage instead of the turret. I'm not positive if the Freeze Combo works against armored targets, but the class still functions much the same way. You could spec out turret, but just as a general rule I don't prefer builds that force a spec card. 

**Krogan Sentinel**

*Why is it outclassed?*

* The big bad Destroyer and Demolisher came along and took the Krogan's uniqueness as the only common heavy weapon, no cooldown build. The Destroyer in particular just does effectively the same job, doesn't get staggered, and does more damage. 

*How to fix it?*

* The one thing the Destroyer can not do is tank the sheer amounts of damage that the Krogan can, especially in rage mode. This along with the potent melee damage makes it distinct from the Destroyer. Along with the ability to detonate TA to make a quick escape. I think by this point most people are familiar with the class, so the general strategy should also be familiar. If you can manage to get Rage mode up with the Cyclonic Modulator IV, you're essentially invincible. 

http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#32RALLO@0@0[A@@@0@0@0@0

* You can tinker with the specifics of the build with the use of gear. There's three ways you'll be doing damage: Weapon (I generally prefer a shotgun), Lift grenades, and melee. Warfighter, Martial Biotic, Shock Trooper, Grenade Capacity, Berserker or Hydraulic Joints are all pretty decent options based on how you prefer to do damage in those three ways, although I personally prefer Shock Trooper/Warfighter. 

**Salarian Infiltrator**

*Why is it outclassed?*

* It's hard to call what was at one time considered to be the best class in the game outclassed. The SI really isn't outclassed, but you rarely see it anymore. The reasons for this is the Geth Infiltrator and the various weapons that have been released that play right into that classes strengths and the Krysae and the nerfs to cloak that it caused. 

*How to fix it?*

* The Geth (and Quarian male to a lesser degree) do best with close range weapons. The Geth because it can take deadly advantage with Hunter Mode, and the Quarian because of the limitations of Arc Grenades. The best way to differentiate the SI is to go back to sniping. Sniping has great synergy with Energy Drain. Valiant and Black Widow are the preferred snipers as always, but the Widow and Javelin are now more viable than ever with the recent nerfs to shield gate. Prox mine is great for heavy targets, and when at close range. Also, headshots are important, especially for the Valiant to pick up those 1 hit kills on mobs. Incendiary ammo is my ammo of choice for snipers for the bleed over during the down part of your cloak cycle, and sets up the rare fire explosion when you get kills with ED or Prox mine.

http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#41POKHD@0@0CA@@@0@0@0@0

* The build that I've been using. Power bonuses don't pick up the bigger shields, while weapon damage can pick up extra one hit kill on body shots. I have the the Valiant IV, and and Energy Drain and a bodyshot will kill mobs, but headshots are always preferred.

I answered Council Operative as frequently play the original Turians.
I've done Platinum solos with both Soldiers, Sentinel and Infiltrator.  I've put my time in and played each class several ways.
So, I headed over to the BBLoB to see how my fellow /r/MECoOp subcribers were guided to outfit their Turian Sentinel.
Not surprising, I don't run RebulicanShredder's build and Ginja_Ninja's skips Warp in favour of maxing the other talents.

The other two don't take Overload or max out Overload.

My original spec was 6/6/6/4/4 and then I used 3/6/6/5/6 for my Platinum solo.
But after some reflection I've evolved my build again.  This is the current spec here:

[**5/5/6/6/4**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Sentinel/Turian/IJPNF/Claymore10AO5AP5//ShotgunRailAmp3/AdrenalineModule3/ShotgunAmp5/)

[**Video**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIDUBz54ZZw)

**Tech Armour**
-----

Tech Armour fills two roles on this character.  First it increases our effective shields with it's 40% DR, only about 30% DR out of cover, but still beneficial as we have no side step or dodge.
Combined with original Turians high base shields it lets us eat a few more shots if we can't duck behind a corner or get into cover.
Detonating, will also stagger most enemies and is usefull in a bind.  But, it's tied to cooldown and may not always be available.

Second, and more importantly we need the 30% power damage increase for Overload.

**Warp**
-----

Warp is used for primarily debuffing bosses.  The Expose evolution increases the damage done by powers and weapons which includes ammo powers.
That is substantial, as Expose is multiplicative and combined with Warp Ammo's bonus to lifted targets means we can two shot Brutes and Ravagers and three shot Scions.
Warp, like many other powers, can also be used to hide you reloading animation with the Claymore.  It allows you to shoot, Warp, reload cancel, and shoot again.
And, depending on the teammates you may score the odd Biotic Explosion and depending on the detonator will still be very powerful because of Warp's Detonate and Explosion evolutions.

**Overload**
-----

It's the penultimate shield and barrier stripping power in the game.  With our evolutions we get 6x multiplier vs robots and **8x** against organics.
This is critical to our survival as we haven't had Reaper tech implanted in our ankles and cannot dodge.  Maximum single target damage is required to stay alive in one on one battles with Phantoms.
If they slash you chances are you'll end up on the floor for the remainder of the round.  To counter, stripping their barrier will put them into defensive mode or expose the low health pool.
Gold Phantoms have 3075 barriers our Overload does 3168 damage to organics shields - their barriers are gone in one cast and with precision they are dead a second later.
Otherwise, it will remove everything short of a Pyro's shields and bosses on Gold.

**Turian Veteran**
-----

In my opinion the owner of the best weapons passive tree in the game.  And, I won't pass that up.  All choices are geared to weapon damage.

**Fitness**
-----

We are allowed up to rank 4 in durabilty and that gives us a pretty high 1200 shields.


Ammo Powers
-----

I generally prefer to use Warp Ammo to leverage the bonus to lifted targets you'll get from casting Warp.
Incendiary also works well with lighter weapons like the Harrier or Wraith that allow use of powers more often to detonate Tech Combos.
This build is not particularly suited to Warp/Incendiary bug abuse because we do not have Pierce.

Armour Slot
-----

I prefer Adrenaline module to offset the slow base speed of Turians.
Shield Power Cells, Cyclonic Modulators and Power Efficiency Modules are also good choices.

I prefer weapon amps in the gear and weapon slot.  They synergize well with Expose and the more base damage you have the better Expose is.

**Loadout**
-----

I generally run the Claymore (Choke and HVB) or Harrier (AR Piercing and Magazine).
Other good choices could be the Wraith, Paladin, Carnifex or PPR (better for bosses - worse for trooper class).

Feedback and Comments welcome :)

1353017155.0,42,self.MECoOp,139h8o,Let's Talk Fitness and Survivability,46,4,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/139h8o/lets_talk_fitness_and_survivability/,"Born out of recent discussion of the merits of Fitness vs. Energy Drain for survivability, I decided to look into a little more detail on the enemy damage values to figure out if there are any particular shield / health thresholds one should be targeting for survivability in a build.  I'm going to scale my comments around Gold, but it's certainly worth thinking about the other difficulties as well.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgoNSTctMEekdDRJMDY5U1JGX1J4R2F1MzNsRjhnZ3c&amp;output=html&amp;gid=2) is a spreadsheet that has the damage of all the enemy attacks.

The question I am wondering is when is it worth putting extra points into Fitness, or using some sort of shield boosting equipment?  The goal is to keep your Shield / Health gates intact as much as possible, which means being able to sustain a direct single hit from certain types of enemies.

Here are my takeaways:

* Shields / Health of 600 or less are basically just Shield / Health gate, as almost every enemy's minimum attack in the game will break the gate
* Shields / Health of 990 are enough to absorb a Banshee Warp, as well as many lower-tier enemy volleys, depending on the rounds in the burst
* Shields / Health between 600 and 990 will see mixed results - some lower-tier attacks will drop shields, others will not, depending on the number of rounds in a burst.
* Shields / Health of 1150 will absorb a full volley from an Assault Trooper, Centurion, Cannibal, Marauder, Geth Trooper, and Collector Trooper.  It will also absorb 2 Engineer shots, 1 Guardian shot, or 1 Hunter shot.
* Shields / Health of 1500 will additionally absorb a Geth Rocket, a full volley from a Collector Captain, and 2 Guardian shots.
* You need roughly 2000 and 2500 Shield / Health to absorb an Atlas and a Nemesis shot, respectively.

This probably won't affect the way I approach too many builds, as Fitness is often just the place where you put leftover points.  But, in deciding which equipment / gear to use, it may make a difference.  ~~Getting over the 1150 bump should actually make a noticeable difference in survivability.~~  (edit:  this was not phrased well.  There is no magic threshold that is going to yield an immediate boost in durability, but I would say that based on my subjective experiences, shields in the range of the low 1000s yield good survivability).

And, it should be noted that even with 0 points in Fitness, if you throw on a Cyclonic Modulator III on a class with base 600 shields, that is sufficient to get you ~~over that 1150 hump~~ in that low 1000s range.  Not that you want to waste Cyclonic Modulators on squishy builds, but it could actually help if you have some to spare.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1353025992.0,,PS3,True,t3_139h8o,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/139h8o/lets_talk_fitness_and_survivability/,

With ARs, SRs, and shotguns expect me to be off with more guns. The reason why I started with SMGs and HPs is because there were significantly fewer of them and the choices were more clear cut. 

**Furthermore, I suck at sniping and don't have all the shotguns yet so if anyone knowledgeable with those two categories is willing to offer some advance input, shoot me PM.**

As always, please feel free to post your remarks in regards to a rating if you don't quite agree. While I do mention this in my other list description, I do feel the need to stress that **weapons are rated relative to each other**. Furthermore, **weapons rankings do not dictate what difficulty I think they should be used on. By all means, you can take a bronze weapon into Plat**. They are instead a thematic ranking system that I choose to rank guns. Please check out the other two lists for more details.

**PLATINUM**
Cerberus Harrier, Prothean Particle Rifle, Saber

**GOLD**
Typhoon, Mattock, Falcon, Striker Assault Rifle, Revenant

**SILVER**
Valkyrie*, Argus, Vindicator, Collector Assault Rifle, Phaeston

**BRONZE**
Geth Pulse Rifle, Avenger

**WEAPONS OVERVIEW**
Assault rifles are the all-rounders of Mass Effect. They are in general able to put out sustained damage which reduces overkill (but necessitates armour penetration) and engage well at all ranges. Their medium weight makes them usable on casters, but they are preferred on soldiers and gun-centric classes.

The category is really dominated by the Cerberus Harrier and to a lesser extent the PPR and the Saber. Though many of the other guns are still very good, they just pale in comparison to these beasts.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1357309587.0,,,True,t3_15w5nq,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/15w5nq/weapons_tier_list_assault_rifles/,

------------------------------------------------

**Event Description:** 

The Reapers are taking advantage of our forces being spread thin and are making a push for Menae. Alliance Intelligence predicts that the Reapers are luring us into committing large-scale defenses to the moon that they will wipe out. Our counter-strategy is to insert small, stealthy units to conduct disruptive offensives and hold the firebase during their hopefully weakened attacks.

**Team Goal:**

Earn the “Survived 5 Waves” medal on the Firebase Condor map at any difficulty. Extraction not required.

**Reward:**

I thought it was weird, and didn't realize it was the same EA account to which my Xbox Live gamertag was tied.

Long story short, I logged onto my Xbox and everything that I had accumulated for the past 5 months in mecoop is gone.  All the characters.  All the weapons.  All the ultra-rare weapons that were about rank V.  Back to square one, and no one at EA support (big surprise) can help.  It appears they don't even comprehend the problem.

This is so much better, and makes it much easier to tell when they're immune to powers. By this point I was usually able to tell when they had their shield up just by watching their stance and looking for that little glow on their palms, but now I never have any doubts. More importantly, it is finally obvious that they have a defense up, so those with less experience won't be left confused or be otherwise unaware of their immunity abilities.

Just thought I'd express my approval for this this change. :)

On another note, discussion about the Phantom's palm shield would also be nice; has anyone found any powers that ignore it?

Basically its a lot like lost package delivery, except your whole squad escorts a probe to the extraction zone. 

You have to stand near the probe in order for the probe to move. I think that if more of your team that stands in the circle of the probe's radius, the faster it moves toward the extraction zone. But I'm not sure about that one. It could be just one person needs to stand in the circle and the probe moves at a consistent rate no matter how many of your squad is in the probes radius. Can Anyone at the con confirm? 

So it's get in the circle around the prob and follow it to the extraction zone. I don't think you have to worry about the probe being destroyed by enemies. We had some banshees on us but they didn't mess with the probe, just.... us.

I also think its self guiding. For you guys that are playing it at the con, please correct me if I'm mistaken. Cheers!

Something to take note of though is you need to remove their barrier/shield before they'll be susceptible to stagger.

Increase power damage taken by a target by 15% for 10 seconds.) or Lasting Damage (Increase damage by 40%. Increase duration by 60%.). 

Here's a tip, **choose Expose**. Expose goes on your biotic explosion damage, other power damage (overload, incinerate etc.) and weapon damage from you and your teammates. Note that Lasting Damage only goes on your warp, it will have no bonuses on your biotic explosions whatsoever which is probably what you're going for as an adept/sentinel/biotic god.

It also stacks, so if you and your teammates are able to hit a target with warp multiple times you'll be able to perform near nuclear damage (the 10 second bonus will still apply even though the warp has been detonated). Lasting damage is good for a class that plans to only use warp alone as a help in a gunfight, such as a turian sentinel.

2. Backup the file we're going to be changing. Locate your Origin Games folder (should be in program files, I have it in another partition). Then go ""Mass Effect 3 --&gt; BIOGame --&gt; CookedPCConsole"" find coalesced.bin and back it up.

3. Close down ME3

4. Open up your coalesced editor utility (the program you downloaded earlier) and hit File --&gt; Open, then locate the same Coalesced.bin file we backed up earlier (not the backed up one, the ""real"" one).

5. Now go to bioinput.ini --&gt; sfxgame --&gt; sfxgamemodedefault --&gt; bindings. When you hit ""bindings = (multiple)"" some text will appear in the right part of the window. These are the default key bindings. 

6. What you want to do is edit the part where it says e.g Name=""One"", if you want to edit your power hotkey 1 you edit this to e.g Name=""ThumbMouseButton"" or Name=""G"". You can pretty much change this to any key you have on your keyboard or mouse. The only thing you have to worry about is that numbers aren't displayed as numbers, but One, Two, Three, Four, etc.. Also there are no spaces. So if you want one to bind to left alt you have to make it Name=""LeftAlt"". You can see which command it binds to by looking at the Command=""commandhere""

7. When you are done, go to ""File --&gt; Save"" then boot up ME3 and have fun with your Talon!

**If you want to apply two keys to one command, just duplicate a command and change the key, so you have two commands with different keys. I suppose this could work for more than two keys as well, but I haven't tested that.**

**It has been confirmed by the MP devs that we are allowed to do this fix. However modding anything else than this, FOV change and omnikey dismantling may result in a ban**

**TL;DR**
For those familiar with coalesced editing, the standard keybindings are located in bioinput.ini --&gt; sfxgame --&gt; sfxgamemodedefault --&gt; bindings = (multiple). Changing the standard keybindings to your custom keys will fix the Talon bug.",[Class Discussion],False,self,t5_2tkk1,1364338173.0,,Alliance,True,t3_19sp44,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19sp44/fixing_the_talon_bug_modding/,

You are the Geth Juggernaut.  You exist to draw fire and give NO FUCKS ever.

**Hex Shield**




* Rank 4 - Strength

* Rank 5 - Shock

* Rank 6 - Damage Synergy







Hex Shield is a key power for you as the Tank.  It is your cover in open areas and your second layer of shields in an enclosed space.  Deploy it against boss enemies, use it to create a choke against hordes or to cover static objectives.  It works as a second version of you to hide behind. Shock is there for extra damage and tech bursting, also useful against charging enemies.  Damage Synergy gives you just a bit more damage on your weapons and prevents an expanded shield from getting in your ally's way.







**Siege Pulse**



* Rank 4 - Radius

* Rank 5 - Damage Protection

* Rank 6 - Number of Shots



Your other bread and butter power.  Additional Damage Protection from the Rank 5 evolution and Rank 6 additional shot.  This makes you even more of a tank.  The Radius gives you better crowd control against mooks.





**Geth Juggernaut**



* Ran 4 - Weapon Damage

* Rank 5 - Power Damage and Force

* Rank 6 - Weapon Damage



With the two powers we are specced into not being damage powers, we go full weapons platform here, except the Rank 5 evo to give us additional force on the siege pulse.






**Harden Platform**


* Rank 4 - Durability

* Rank 5 - Recharge

* Rank 6 - Power Transfer





You are a tank, all rank evolutions reflect this.  We want to maximize shields and shield recharging.  You can stand toe to toe with Banshees and Praetorians on Gold with this.


Ignore Sentry Turret.  Doesn't do enough and it will never be as good as a Prime's turret.



**Weapons and Gear**


Good weapons to use are

* M-7 Lancer

* Harrier

* Prothean Particle Rifle

* Typhoon


Use of backup pistols or sniper rifles is not bad either.  I'm partial to the CSR, PPR, or Lancer due to not running for ammo since you are slower than frozen molasses.  For gear,  Shield Booster, Stronghold Package, or any gear that ups Assault Rifle damage/stability/thermal clip capacity are all good choices.  Have not tried Batarian Gaunlets since I did not unlock that yet, but they sound hilarious to slap on him.



**Difficulties**


On silver and below, stand tall, stand proud, stand in the open and don't give a shit.

On Gold be more careful of your choices and engaging the enemy.  Anything smaller than a scion, don't give a fuck.  Stand your ground and wipe it out.  Use right-hand advantage.  Against Scions, Praetorians, and Atlases.  Drop the Hex Shield and back slowly away, and do not use Siege Pulse against it.  You want all 4 charges on your shoulder to maximize Damage Protection.   Heavy Melee whenever possible to recharge your shields, you can stand against anything if you time things right.  If your team mates are smart they will stick around you and use you as a decoy.  The dumb ones run off and go down.  Don't bother trying to reach them, you can't, you're too slow.  You can easily pull a 100k score on gold playing smart.








**EDIT:**  Did more testing.  This guy is the most serious guddam tank ever.  As for the war of Turret vs Hex Shield, I can say it doesn't really matter what you choose.  I tried a Plat/Random/Random round, wound up on Ghost/Reaper.  By wave three I was tanking 2 Banshees, 1 Brute, 3 Geth Pyros and 2 Hunters on Plat all at once.  The 925 shields restore of a maxed Hardened Platform Heavy Melee is godlike when you have 4600 shields and a Shield Booster on for an additional 1400 shields.  Heavy Melee the shit out of everything that gets close.  Banshees are not even a problem for the Juggernaut.  M-7 Lancer is by far one of the best guns on him, unless you hump a ammo box with a Harrier, but even a Lancer I compares well to a Harrier VI from my experience.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1362117629.0,,Spectre,True,t3_19b46g,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19b46g/im_the_juggernaut_bitch_the_geth_juggernaut_and/,

When you're making a post (this includes both threads and comments) and you want to include a link to the BioWare Social Network Forums (that means any url with social.bioware.com in it, even linking to your manifest on the N7HQ), if you can please avoid inserting a direct link. This is because any direct links to BSN flag the post and it will end up in the spam filter. It gets worse if you edit your post, as every time you make an edit you have to resubmit the post, which means it gets flagged *again*. This means no-one can see it until one of us logs on, checks the spam filter and approves it. 

That means, avoid using any of these:

[link to BSN](http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15244640)

And also these:

http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15244640

I know, it sucks. But! There is a workaround. If you need to put in a link to a BSN thread, paste in the link as directly above, **but remove the http:// at the beginning.**

So, like this:

Do that, and you're golden. People can simply copy and paste that link in a new tab or window to get to the thread you listed, and you don't have to wait on one of the mods to approve your comment.

There are other things that trigger the spam filter, things beyond even our near-infinite comprehension, but this one is by far the most common. Hopefully now that we've shared with you the secret workaround, it will stop being a problem.

There are enough of us experienced players to help out and have a few games (I'm certainly willing to help any local people and I've noticed in the past many others also offering help). The benefit to those helping is a larger pool of competent players. The only prerequisite I would insist on would be having a microphone.

Thoughts?

Seems like this is a worthwhile thing to do. Hopefully you've all found someone to help you out below.

I play with a group of XBox players, and a couple of weeks ago we wound up in a Platinum match v. Cerberus on Giant. No biggie. Well, one of us glitched at the beginning and never made it in the first wave, had to exit and re-enter the game. Still no biggie. Until we realize that two of the remaining 3, myself included, can't see any of the bajillion Phantoms swarming the map. OR turrets. When our 4th rejoined, we can't see him either. No indications in the kill feed that he, phantoms, or turrets even exist. Yet through some amazing teamwork, including yelling out phantom locations, telling us poor souls who couldn't see where to aim a missile, being sure to keep the one of us who wasn't glitched up so he could rev the person we couldn't see, we almost, ALMOST cleared wave 9. 

Last night, with the same group on Glacier v. Reapers, the match got started accidentally when one of us was still speccing a volus, essentially rendering her a level 1. Another one of us had a catastrophic problem with his screen that made it impossible for him to see (power outage likely to blame). So, we go through that match with the volus acting like a seeing eye dog for the blind Batarian Brawler. I, as a Justicar, tried to reave everything around him so he could charge blind and and create explosions. Our fourth, a quarian engineer I believe, attempted to draw aggro and keep the rest of us from getting massacred, getting activate objectives, etc. Not only was it a full extraction, the blind batarian scored 61,000 points. He can now literally claim he can play this game with his eyes closed.

That means I've had plenty of time to get acquainted with their new mob unit, the Dragoon. And my conclusion is: they're fucking cunts. But now that I've gone through so many of them, I feel I can finally shed some light on the basic do's and don'ts when it comes to our Smash-happy friend. Hopefully playing with pugs won't be as painful for you as it has been for me.

First off, a debrief:

- Dragoons are essentially the Cerberus equivalent of a Geth Pyro. They're ever-advancing armoured targets that try to get up in your grill so they can unleash their devastating close range attacks. **You do not want this.** Smash will stagger you, it has a ridiculous lunge and they can whip out their Hornet seemingly immediately after the animation to gun you down while you're still reeling. They will spam Smash and heavy melee attacks as long as they're on top of you, which means escaping is difficult unless you're packing good weapons - more on this later.

- Dragoons spawn (on Gold) on waves **3, 4, 6, 7 and extraction** - remember that so you can plan accordingly.

- Dragoons also **move in packs** like Pyros, either with other Dragoons or with their bitches, the Phantoms. I'm sure I don't need to explain how hellish that combination is.

- **Dragoons can't be grabbed.** Or at least, every time I've gone to grab one the prompt has never come up. It makes a certain kind of sense now that Pyros are ungrabbable too - another, particularly aggravating similarity.

- On top of that, **they can stomp you**, and they're fairly quick to do so.

So these guys are **high priority** targets. You see a Dragoon in your FOV, you take him out before he can get within Smash range. **Keep them at a distance** and go for the head - they may have armour but at least they don't have any demon barrier absorption technique or flips of invincibility. In fact, when they're out of Smash range, they're essentially just Assault Troopers with armour and a considerably lesser threat, but again, don't think this means you can leave them be; you do not want them getting close to you. Take advantage of this. There are numerous ways to temporarily immobilise a Dragoon and stop them from ever getting within lethal distance. They're susceptible to **stuns from electric attacks** such as Overload, Submission Net, Disruptor Ammo, and **staggers from projectile powers**.  As they're armoured, that means they're highly vulnerable to **biotic explosions** and **incendiary powers**. Fire Explosions are your friend when taking these guys on. **They will also get distracted** by Combat Drones and Decoy as well, so you can use that as another tool to hinder their assault. As long as you can do that much, you're golden, and your teammates will really appreciate it.

Okay, so let's say one of them does get close to you. You may have gotten tunnel-visioned on an Atlas or a Phantom or they already went through your teammates and have come for you next. You're not entirely out of luck, although your odds or survival are lowered. Therefore what you will need is **staggers**, and lots of them. While in their Smash animation they have a **high stagger threshold** - from what I can tell without any numbers, it's about equivalent to Phantoms. That means you need an on-demand stagger weapon or power to interrupt their carnage. **Biotic Charge, Havoc Strike, Proximity Mine, Geth Plasma Shotgun, M-37 Falcon, and Scorpion** are all things I would recommend for a reliable stagger. Once you get a break in their onslaught, try and stagger them, then either take them out fast or relocate. Remember, they move in packs, often with Phantoms in later waves, so sometimes the best tactic is to move to cover at a safer distance to pick them off. Don't stay in one place too long though or you'll most likely end up getting flanked by either more Dragoons or Phantoms. They force you to keep moving and stay alert. And don't try going toe to toe with them unless you're packing some serious heat because with the new health gate mechanics they will kill you fast.

That's pretty much all I have to say about Dragoons for now, if you have any pro-tips you'd like to share, post it in the comments. These guys can wreck entire teams if they're allowed to go about their business so I would say think about that when building your characters. But if you know what you're doing, you should be good.

A lot of people gave good feedback which I hadn't initially taken into account or asked about weapons that weren't on the list, so I've decided to do a rundown of every weapon in every category using updated stat values (which I didn't have initially). All statistics are taken from the level I version of the guns, as they all scale similarly. I'm going to start out with shotguns because, honestly, who doesn't love shotguns? Commies, that's who. 

**Katana**


*Damage (per pellet)*: 48.1

*Clip Capacity*: 5

*ROF*: 60

*Burst DPS*: 482

*Sustained DPS*: 370

*Effective Range*: Close

*Weight*: 1.5


The Katana is (as befits the default weapon) the most traditional shotgun. It has a relatively high capacity, medium-slow firing rate, and decent damage. There is nothing exceptional about this weapon, but like the Avenger, that can be as much a strength as a weakness since in turn it has no crippling flaws (other than range, as befits a traditional shotgun). However, the lack of range really does prevent this from being the main weapon of most classes, while the weight is a hindrance as a sidearm. Traditional shotgun classes (Vanguards, shotgun infiltrators, any krogans) will thus get more mileage out of this gun than others, though there are arguably better options.



**Scimitar**


*Damage (per pellet)*: 35.4

*Clip Capacity*: 8

*ROF*: 100

*Burst DPS*: 589

*Sustained DPS*: 384

*Effective Range*: Close

*Weight*: 1.5


The Scimitar does less damage per shot than the Katana but trades this for a larger thermal clip and much improved fire rate. In fact, it is the fastest firing shotgun available in multiplayer. While normally I prefer high damage per shot to high fire rate (since it allows longer 'safe periods' behind cover) in this case the DPS difference is significant enough that I would recommend the Scimitar over the Katana in any situation. However, it shares the Katana's main weaknesses as well, mainly lack of range/utility and relatively high weight for a secondary. It also has a significantly longer reload time than the Katana (almost double), meaning you need to be wary of your clip before charging in headlong.



**Eviscerator**


*Damage (per pellet)*: 60

*Clip Capacity*: 3

*ROF*: 48

*Burst DPS*: 479

*Sustained DPS*: 342

*Effective Range*: Close-Mid, Long (with smart choke)

*Weight*: 1.5


On paper the Eviscerator is one of the weaker shotguns. However, what it lacks in stopping power it makes up for in range and accuracy. The Eviscerator has the tightest spread of the traditional shotguns and, most importantly, has Assault Rifle damage range statistics. This means it suffers far less damage dropoff over range than other shotguns (excepting the Graal, Crusader, and GPS). The accuracy bonus from a smart choke can actually give this gun carnifex/saber level precision (provided you get used to aiming with the shotgun circle). This means that it has more utility than both the Katana and Scimitar, as it can engage targets at any range. This makes it a safe primary weapon choice for most classes, though power spammers will still want to be wary of the weight. This utility comes at the cost of a tiny thermal clip (only three shots, though it has a fast reload) and overall damage (though this can be made up for with the higher headshot potential). Overall a solid choice, though the Wraith is a straight upgrade in every since if you have one.



**Wraith**


*Damage (per pellet)*: 89.5

*Clip Capacity*: 2

*ROF*: 48

*Burst DPS*: 716

*Sustained DPS*: 448

*Effective Range*: Close-Mid, Long (with smart choke)

*Weight*: 1.5


Effectively the same as the Eviscerator with more damage and even less capacity. In most situations, a straight upgrade.



**Disciple**


*Damage (per pellet)*: 46.3

*Clip Capacity*: 4

*ROF*: 75

*Burst DPS*: 578

*Sustained DPS*: 338

*Effective Range*: Close

*Weight*: 1


The Disciple is the best sidearm shotgun, with a combination of low weight and high burst damage. However, it lacks as a primary weapon because of not only the aforementioned range issue, but also the combination of a low thermal clip (4 rounds) and a high reload time (2.27 seconds). This combines to give it a disappointingly low sustained damage output (lowest of any shotgun). Still, when used as a fallback weapon to quickly eliminate close range enemies, it's high fire rate and damage give it solid burst. This will likely be the shotgun of choice for any class using long range weapons who want a low weight answer to enemies looking to invade their personal space.



**Claymore**


*Damage (per pellet)*: 167.8 (no, that is not a typo)

*Clip Capacity*: 1

*ROF*: 64 (however, reload duration is 2.57 and it only holds one shot)

*Burst DPS*: 1,648

*Sustained DPS*: 470

*Effective Range*: Close

*Weight*: 2.5


The claymore is the epitome of what most people think of as a shotgun. It is huge, it is heavy, and it chunks anything you point it at. The high burst damage (highest of any shotgun) means that you're going to be sitting down any basic type enemy you come across in one shot, bar none. The fact that it uses pellets means that this weapon can actually oneshot shielded enemies on gold (all shotguns can, but this one is most likely to do so). Of course, being the epitome of a shotgun means it also exemplifies all of their crippling weaknesses. The reload time is a whopping 2.57 seconds, meaning that you need to make every shot count. If you don't oneshot your opponent, you've got three seconds of helplessness (short of reload canceling) during which they can return fire at you. The high weight is also problematic for any class that values short cooldowns (read: everything except soldiers). Vanguards will want to stay away due to the weight but shotgun infiltrators can pair the already massive damage with their tactical cloak bonus for truly disgusting amounts of burst.



**Crusader**


*Damage (slug)*: 353.7

*Clip Capacity*: 4

*ROF*: 80

*Burst DPS*: 589

*Sustained DPS*: 393

*Effective Range*: Mid-Long

*Weight*: 2.5


The crusader is a shotgun that is not a shotgun. If anything, it shares more in common with a scopeless sniper rifle or a (very) heavy pistol. It fires slugs instead of pellets, meaning no shield penetration on gold. However, it fires VERY accurately and rather quickly. It's hard to compare this to other shotguns because it fills a very different role, but altogether I'd say it's not very effective. The Saber/Carnifex fill the same niche as the Crusader with significantly less weight, higher capacity, and approximately the same DPS. If you want a long range shotgun, go with the GPS, Graal, or Wraith.



**Geth Plasma Shotgun (GPS)**


*Damage (slug-esque)*: 714.2

*Clip Capacity*: 5

*ROF*: 60

*Burst DPS*: 1,428

*Sustained DPS*: 943

*Effective Range*: Mid-Long

*Weight*: 2


The GPS is a crowd favorite at the moment and it's not hard to see why. It has a very high burst DPS and the highest sustained DPS out of any shotgun. The projectiles, while relatively slow moving, have deceptively amazing range and track enemies to a small degree. The shots can also be charged and held while you run around, enabling huge burst potential (as an infiltrator, make sure to cloak AFTER you begin to charge, otherwise charging will cancel cloak). This means you can unload the entire clip at an enemy for high burst damage or fire slower, more damaging shots to deal with armor (just keep in mind charged shots use 2 units of ammunition). However, this weapon has two crippling weaknesses which (in my mind) put it behind the Graal as the best main shotgun. Firstly, it cannot headshot (or get bonus damage from any weak spot, for that matter). This is huge, as the headshot damage multiplier is brokenly strong. This means that despite doing superior damage per shot, it has lower potential damage against any enemy with a weak point. Secondly, it doesn't work as well as a traditional shotgun at close ranges. Also, due to not firing pellets, this weapon cannot penetrate shields on Gold as other shotguns can. Still, it's an amazing weapon with almost unparalleled utility and great damage at any range. It beats out the Graal in dealing with most large type enemies that lack weak spots (brutes, ravagers, banshees) and the higher clip capacity means you have more longevity in your engagements.



**Graal Spike Thrower**


*Damage (per flechette)*: 80

*Clip Capacity*: 3

*ROF*: 80

*Burst DPS*: 1,600

*Sustained DPS*: 747

*Effective Range*: Any

*Weight*: 2


The Graal is the second 'god tier' shotgun, paralleled only by the GPS for utility and the Claymore for burst damage. While it has a lower sustained DPS than the GPS, the ability to benefit from enemy weak points gives it the edge on damage in most situations (though this may change when they 'fix' the weakspots on Atlases and Primes). Though it has a large spread when fired at the hip (actually a boon for frantic close range engagements), when aiming the spread is basically pinpoint. The main drawback is that the projectiles are not hitscan and lack the tracking of the GPS energy rounds, meaning you need to be able to lead properly to hit targets at range. Once you've mastered that, however, you've got a shotgun that can obliterate anything close range while still maintaining the accuracy and damage potential of most sniper rifles. Like the GPS, each shot can be charged prior to cloaking for incredible burst or in order to better deal with armor. Ultimately this is my favorite choice for any class that would main a shotgun, especially shotgun infiltrators.


Those are my thoughts on the subject, but I'd love to hear what everyone else thinks in the comments. Please let me know if I got any numbers wrong or if you feel I misrepresented your favorite weapon (most likely to happen with the Crusader, which I haven't yet unlocked and had to ask my friend about).",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,True,,PC,True,t3_ruc1b,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/ruc1b/lets_talk_shotguns_stat_breakdown_and_discussion/,

**Volus** *Rank: Green*

The miniscule volus have created combat-approved exo-suits and have joined our enemies in their campaign. After mastering the asari technique of Stasis, as well as bringing their Shield Boost technology, the volus Adept has morphed the commonly used Warp technique to suit their tactics.

Killed-in-action statistics have shown an alarming number of Centurion-class officer deaths at the hands of volus enemies. Often, after repeated shots from their standard-issue M96-Mattock Semi-Automatic assault rifle the volus is unshielded with heavy damage to the exo-suit. Upon reloading, the Centurion is overwhelmed with a fully shielded, angry volus. Shield Boost is the revolutionary technology developed by volus scientists and, as of yet, unattained by Cerberus intelligence. With a press of a button, the volus can recharge their own combat shielding *as well as their allies'*. Squadrons have been absolutely devastated by an Alliance team of this volus with a large, aggressive unit such as the Geth Class-B Soldier known as the 'Juggernaut' or the Warlord Krogan Class-B Sentinel.

Upon discovering a volus basic training vessel hidden in the asteroid belt of the Aru system, Cerberus engineers recently managed to uncover information on their biotic training. Evolving the commonly used technique 'Warp', the volus have managed to split each individual projectile into 3 or 4 smaller orbs. In doing so, the volus' exo-suit's cooldown function is only applied to creating the orbs themselves. Cerberus troops are advised to count the number of orbs surrounding a volus Adept, much like they count shots before heat clip ejection in enemy armament, and to engage when the volus runs out. Often times, volus Adepts leech the Orbs' power directly into the exo-suit, speeding up other abilities' cooldown times and increasing the strength of their shielding. 

* Battlefield vids have yet to show any kind of melee fortitude with volus combatants. Phantom- and Dragoon-class operatives have standing orders to engage volus Adepts, Engineers, Sentinels and Vanguards with extreme prejudice. 

**Krogan** *Rank: Red*

The krogan Adept is an extremely unusual adversary. Normal krogan tactics are ineffective and sometimes dangerous to use against the Adept. Often, greenhorn Cerberus Assault Troopers establish the tried-and-tested 'killbox' method of taking down krogan upon hearing the battle cry of Tuchanka. Before this is set up, however, the krogan Adept lets loose a Shockwave that blows them back and executes them one by one. 

The loose commands of taking down Adepts filter down to focused fire to bring down their weak barriers and flank as needed, as Adepts often use speed and devastating biotic power to overwhelm their opponents. Krogan Adepts have faced down Atlas mechs and emerged victorious. This bears repeating. Do **not** engage a krogan Adept without backup or reinforcements and expect to live. Not only do these tribal behemoths throw their weight around with Shockwave, or toss out Warps at a moment's notice, the krogan Adept shrugs off small arms with the ability to divert biotic power into its Barrier to decrease sustained fire against the beast. 

Instead of the krogan killbox configuration, frontline soldiers are advised to adopt a fan-like arrangement in front of the krogan. Far enough away so that Shockwave cannot hit multiple infantrymen, and engage at the same time. If possible, have personnel equipped with the M96-Mattock semiautomatic rifle or the M-358 Talon shotgun revolver fire directly in front of the target. Krogan have evolved in such a way that their eyes are on either side of their head, to prepare for attacks from the side and above, leaving a small gap directly in front of them that is similar to our peripheral vision. This approach is extremely high risk for high reward for Phantom- and Dragoon-class specialists. If you manage to sneak in, the krogan is in serious trouble, but if you get close to an enemy krogan, he'll charge. You don't want that.

**Batarian** *Rank: Red*

Before Cerberus launched our full-scale war on the Alliance Navy and its allies, batarians were thought to not have biotic potential. Firefight evidence have proved that to be untrue.

These four-eyed barbarians carry Cluster Grenades, much like the drell, as well as being quite proficient with the Warp technique. Dragoons must be wary upon approach of these Adepts, as said Warp can drastically affect their armour's durability.

It seems our back-stabbing deserters have also divulged their secrets to alien races, as batarian Adepts have shown to be effective Lash users as well. Cerberus casualties have proven that the Lash ability can detonate Warp's effect on any insurgent without armour, so, for those who have proven to need a shield, do not think it will negate Warp's danger completely.

Additionally, the batarians as a species have altered their omni-tools for extreme close-quarters combat. Combined with Lash to bring distant enemies into range, batarians employing their 'Enforcement Gauntlets' have been known to sever head from neck from even the most hardened of opponents. Rumours have surfaced of batarians who have blown Reaper Ravagers in half, or even disintegrating Collector Praetorians after sustained fire. There is only one way to stop the batarian Enforcement Gauntlet, and that is to not be in range when it is deployed. Cerberus engineers have determined that servos in the Gauntlet lock the batarian's armour that renders small-arms fire almost useless. What baffles the engineers completely is the batarians ability to track an enemy for meters during the initial wind-up. Even when the target is knocked away, intentionally or not, batarians have managed to travel tens of meters to execute their target.

Due to their close-range aptitude, batarian Adepts are best handled at a distance. Nemesis-ranked snipers are ordered to make batarians their primary target, due to the batarian's armour design rendering them incapable of basic combat rolls. Atlas Infantry Fighting Exoskeleton pilots should engage batarians from whatever distance is efficient, as batarians can be eliminated with the anti-personnel cannon as well as the Atlas' multi-function hydraulic claw.

**Collector** *Rank: Further Analysis Needed*

In faraway systems, where the Alliance has the lowest rate of operative fatalities, Cerberus agents have reported the presence of a Collector working in tandem with the Alliance squadrons. Current understandings of Collector/Reaper relations have shown that indoctrination is irreversible, but these findings have baffled even our most seasoned indoctrination experts. 

From the extremely limited amounts of reconnaissance attaining to these Adepts, we've established a basic view of their tactics. They have an affinity for energy-based and heat-generation weapons, so do not wait for them to reload to engage, it won't be happening. If you do see these weapons 'reloading', do not hesitate. Do not think, engage and empty your clip. This is your chance to take it out.

Their biotics are strange and surprisingly strong. Upon their first appearance, the Cerberus platoon confirmed that the Collector Adept employs Dark Channel on the battlefield. Standard tactics apply for this, fan away and isolate affected comrades. The Adepts have also been seen to generate floating insect life charged with biotic power. Initial reports show these to be similar to the paralyzing Seeker Swarms created by the Collectors on the human population some years ago, but these reports have not been confirmed.

Some Collector Adepts have also thrown a large, green, slow-moving ball after a small focus of their biotics. It seemed to emit Reave in a small radius around it, and had no cooldown whatsoever. We have recorded these Adepts throwing this sphere immediately before using Dark Channel. Sometimes, the Reave-ball has detonated, often taking out unshielded enemies that are almost 7 meters away from the impact point. Phantom-class operatives are warned that this sphere can short out your Tactical Cloak and nullify the invisibility it grants you.

**LEVEL EPSILON CLEARANCE ACCEPTED: REDACTED TEXT UNSCRAMBLED**

One vid, that has made the rounds amid Cerberus HQ, has shown a disturbing scene. Upon engaging of Cerberus troops, a Collector Adept seemed to become 'Possessed' as other hostile Collectors are prone to do. Instead of a fiery orange glow, the Adept took on an eerie green one, that made it an easy target. Judging by how the Collector moved and the noises it made, gunfire seemed to be very effective. It seldom left cover while 'possessed'. 

Then, the Adept threw a Reave-ball into the platoon. Three Assault Troopers died *from the 'Reave' alone*. Upon detonation, two Centurion officers and a Nemesis marksman fell. Cerberus soldiers are advised to retreat and wait to engage the Collector Adept again. The vid showed that the Adept could only maintain this state of enhancement for about 45 seconds. [END UNSCRAMBLED TEXT]

Cerberus training instructors have yet to apply an effective attack strategy on these Adepts. Centurion officers have free reign to engage as they see fit. Troopers are encouraged to take these 'unchained' Collectors alive, for their ability to reverse the indoctrination process could put Cerberus researchers years into the future.",[Story Time],False,self,t5_2tkk1,1376347677.0,,Xbox,True,t3_1k4ukl,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1k4ukl/the_official_cerberus_handbook_chapter_12_adepts/,

**What is the BBLoB?**  
The **B**ig **B**ad **L**ist **o**f **B**uilds is a list that I put together and work on that compiles all of the user-submitted, Committee-approved, builds. The only requirements are that it's hosted on reddit, it has a link to the build on Narida's Character Creator, and isn't a repeat of a previous build (determined by the Committee).

**How does the BBLoB work?**  
On the surface, it's just a compilation of builds. Behind the scenes, there are spreadsheets, a private subreddit, and five dedicated individuals to give you the simplest path to playing the character the way you want to play it.

**You mentioned a Committee?**  
There are four members of this subreddit who have a lot of expertise on the game's mechanics who are called in to help categorize the submitted builds. They are /u/RepublicanShredder, /u/InterwebNinja, /u/mrcle123, and /u/Simplywaffle. 

**So how do I put a build on the BBLoB?**  
Quite simply actually. Just make a post on this subreddit and tag it as a build. I'll see it and add it to the aforementioned spreadsheet and let you know when I do. Then the aforementioned Committee will categorize it and rate it. After that, I'll wait a week or so and add it to the BBLoB and make a reply to your post whether it's been added or not.

If you have any questions put 'em in here and I'll try to get to them ASAP.

Yes I'm still working on the ones that are currently being reviewed, I'll get to them soon.

For more information, see [Class 401: Introduction to Weapons](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/179vze/class_401_introduction_to_weapons/))*

Ammo powers are consumables that add special effects to the shots fired from all equipped weapons. They range in rarity and effectiveness and can be obtained from packs purchased in the store.

For most ammo powers that deal extra damage, the ammo power damage is dealt before the actual weapon damage. This property is useful when overcoming shieldgating. Additionally, certain ammo powers only deal damage to certain defence and health types.

For ammo powers that apply an effect, each shot has a chance to apply the effect. Rapid fire weapons and projectile weapons are usually have the best application rate for these effects. Innate properties of ammo powers occur immediately.

Certain ammo powers can also set up tech combos. However, these are generally much weaker than normal combos since ammos count as level 1 abilities, regardless of tier.

Ammo power descriptions consist of:

* *Effect:* The core effect of the ammo power

* *Damages:* If the ammo power deals damage, which types of defence it damages and any multipliers it has

* *Application:* What situations this ammo power is good for

**AMMO POWERS**
---

**ARMOUR PIERCING AMMO**

*Effect*: Provides a high amount of armour penetration and moderate cover penetration. Deals immediate bonus damage based on weapon damage.

*Damages:* Health, Armour

*Application*: Great ammo power for any rapid fire weapons or multi pellet weapons like shotguns because of how important AP is for those weapons. Using this ammo power can free up an extra weapon mod slot for other purposes. 

**CRYO AMMO**

*Effect:* Weakens armour DR, reduces enemy movement speed, and has a chance to chill/freeze a target. Sets up cryo explosions on frozen targets.

*Damages:* N/A

*Application:* This ammo can be good with AoE weapons like the Falcon or the Scorpion for massive application of the slowing effect and the setting up of cryo explosions. If armour weakening is being sought after, there are better options that also deal damage.

**DISRUPTOR AMMO**

*Effect:* Delays enemy shield regen by 8 seconds. Has a chance to stun lesser enemies and also set up tech bursts. Deals bonus damage based on weapon damage which has a 4x multiplier against barriers and shields.

*Damages:* Health, Shields (4x), Barriers (4x)

*Application:* This ammo is great for stripping shields with in certain cases can overcome shield gating for sniper rifles. The stun effect of the ammo is potent CC and the ammo has a good chance to set up tech bursts.

**INCENDIARY AMMO**

*Effect:* The core effect of this ammo is that each shot also applies a 3 burning DoT based on weapon damage, which can be detonated for a fire explosion. However, some strange game mechanics have been uncovered by players in how the ammo power actually functions. Instead of each shot applying a separate DoT that runs out independently, the DoT effects stack up on each other and do not actually tick until the gun stops being fired. This results in ridiculous burning damage on a target with rapid fire weapons. The ammo power also has an interaction with warp that leads to even crazier amounts of damage.

For a more in-depth look and an example, see [mrcle123's post on the subject](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/18os9u/can_you_help_me_piece_together_how_incendiary/c8gn7pv)

*Damages*: Health, Armour

*Applications*: Incendiary ammo can create some devastating combinations on the battlefield. The infamous incendiary ammo+Reegar carbine combo is one of the most potent setups in the game and can melt bosses in mere seconds. It is recommended that classes like incinerate and flamer not be used with this ammo power as their DoTs interfere with the ammo DoT.

**WARP AMMO**

*Effects:* Weakens armour. Deals significant bonus damage to targets based on weapon damage and deals even greater amount of damage (in addition to the base effect) if the target is primed for a biotic explosion. 

*Damages:* Health, Barriers (2x), Armour

*Applications:* Widely regarded as one of the best ammo powers, warp ammo offers extremely high damage while also providing some armour weakening. Due to the massive damage bonus granted when hitting biotically primed targets, the ammo works great on classes that have long lasting primers such as warp, reave, or dark channel. The extra bonus against barriers also makes it a great choice when dealing with Collectors due to the commonality of barriers.

**PHASIC ROUNDS**

*Effect*: Delays shield enemy shield regen by 15 seconds. Deals bonus damage based on weapon damage and has massive multipliers against shields and barriers.

*Damages:* Health, Shields (10x), Barriers(10x)

*Applications:* Phasic rounds are one of the best choices for high burst, single-shot weapons, most notably sniper rifles. Their massive bonus against shields and barriers and the fact that the damage is applied before weapon damage means they are great for dealing with shield gating.

**DRILL ROUNDS**

*Effects:* Offers moderate armour penetration and high cover penetration. Deals bonus damage based on weapon damage.

*Damages:* Health, Armour

*Applications:* This ammo is commonly used in wall-hacking playstyles, where players stack high amounts of cover penetration and use abilities that see through cover (such as Hunter mode, Geth scanner, and Recon mine) to hit enemies before they even come into line of sight. It is best used on weapons that have innate cover penetration as otherwise the weapon will suffer heavy cover penetration damage penalties.

**EXPLOSIVE ROUNDS**

*Effects:* Deals bonus damage based on weapon damage up to a cap in a delayed explosion. Explosion cannot occur until the weapon stops firing on the target.

*Damages:* All

*Applications:* Explosive are seen by many as difficult to make good use of. The damage is delayed and also not very strong meaning there are often better choices. However since the explosion has a strong chance to stagger enemies, some players have chosen to take it on slow firing weapons for more CC.",[College],False,self,t5_2tkk1,1363364145.0,,,True,t3_1acpku,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1acpku/class_411_ammo_powers/,

In 2179, an Asari student by the name of Nial Tenim, an up and coming scholar in the field of theology, staged what would come to be known as the deadliest terrorist attack ever perpetrated on Earth by a foreign sapient species. Using an odd combination of advanced combat armor and powerful biotics, she was able to detonate both herself and objects around her while remaining impervious to harm. Her infamous campaign across the city of Istanbul was finally put to a stop when local law enforcement managed to kill her before she could prime her armor to detonate over the steps of the Hagia Sophia. 17,274 lives were lost that day, sparking bitter debate in Citadel space on the effects of human culture on the galaxy at large, and the threat it represented to Asari cultural hegemony.

In her personal manifesto, found in a police raid of her apartment on the morning following her death, Nial cited 20th century extremist fundamentalist thinkers such as Sayyid Qutb and Omar Abdel-Rahman as her inspiration, and claimed to feel disillusioned by the accepting and culturally moderate nature of Earth's Muslim population. While social scientists and religious fundamentalists argued over what the lengthy manifesto says for religion and humanity as a whole, military engineers and PMCs across the galaxy combed over her notes in an attempt to recreate the potent and destructive power she had unleashed upon the world.

**Class:**

Asari Valkyrie

**Power Evolutions:**

* Tech Armor: Damage and Radius (4), Power Damage (5)

* Warp: Detonate (4), Expose (5), Recharge Speed (6)

* Annihilation Field: Damage (4), Damage Taken (5), Drain (6)

* Asari Valkyrie: Damage and Capacity (4), Power Damage (5)

* Fitness: Durability (4)*

*(If you're feeling reckless, you can replace Durability with Tech Armor's Power Recharge (6))

**Weapons:**

Try to keep cooldowns above 150% and stick to either high-DPS weapons like the Talon/Carnifex or utility weapons like the Acolyte/Scorpion. I personally switch between the acolyte and Talon, sometimes with the Locust or Geth SMG for large groups of enemies. The acolyte is great at activating ammo bonuses and stripping shields, while the DPS of the Talon whittles away the pesky extra bars of the enemies that survive biotic explosions.

You can also use the Disciple Shotgun to stagger and stun enemies while waiting for Warp's cooldown to end, allowing you to finish off enemies with a second explosion.

**Gear:**

You live and die by your cooldowns, so try and get the recharge rate higher with mods if you have any. I'd GREATLY recommend using the Medi-Gel Transmitter gear bonus, though, as this is a reckless build with a steep learning curve, and many teammates are likely to die trying to rescue you.

**Strategy:**

At the beginning of every round, dispel and reset Annihilation field. For smaller enemies, run up to them, hit them with warp while the annihilation field is primed, finish them off with your weapon if they still alive, and find cover if there are more enemies nearby. For boss characters, run up to them so that they are primed with AF, use warp to trigger and explosion, dash away, dash back in to re-prime them, and repeat. Once you get the hang of this you will spam explosions like spitfire. unlike the N7 Fury, however, you are a bit less likely to die in five seconds for being reckless. NEVER approach an enemy capable of sync kills from the front; a close combat build like this is especially susceptible to them. If you're surrounded by mooks, detonate the Tech Armor and AF while making your escape to cover.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,,True,t3_121iek,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/121iek/asari_terrorist_martyr_asari_valkyrie_build/,
1350405525.0,39,self.MECoOp,11ks3x,Archangel: Turian Ghost Sniper,39,0,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11ks3x/archangel_turian_ghost_sniper/,"By now most of you should know how dominant of a character the ghost is with assault rifles. My weapon of choice with him is a harrier and he absolutely tears any enemy apart on gold.

However, I know a lot of people wanted a Turian Infiltrator that was more like Garrus and focused on sniping. This Archangel build is fairly exciting not only because it gives the Ghost a viable sniping option, but because it also heralds a return of the single-shot sniper rifle to effectiveness on gold. This all revolves around the new possibility of getting a cloak damage bonus on overload.

Here is the build I'm currently using that gives me the option to switch back and forth with an assault rifle loadout: [Ghost Mk. III](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#46LRDHQg7@0PE@@P4Q4@0@0)

Here is the build I would recommend for someone with no interest in using assault rifles that wanted to snipe 100% of the time: [Sniper Ghost Mk. I](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#46LJDNQg7@0PE@@P4Q4@0@0)

If you spec your overload correctly, it will be strong enough to fully eliminate the shields/barriers of any elite enemy. Yes, even phantoms. This opens them up to a shield-gate-free killshot from your high-powered sniper rifle. I had previously been running damage/neural/chain, and it was strong enough to take down all of cerberus' shields, but came up short against geth hunters and pyros. Switching to chain/neural/shield reduces the overall base damage of the power, but increases the damage it does against shields compared to the previous spec, making it powerful enough to fully eliminate the stronger geth shields.

The javelin feels perfect on this guy. It boasts the highest damage of any sniper rifle, and the stun overload gives you on your target makes it extremely easy to line up bodyshots (I've found the only enemy you actually need to get headshots on are dragoons). The firing delay is hardly a factor at all when you're stunning with overload. Plus, it's so powerful that you can kill trooper-class or unshielded enemies with a single uncloaked bodyshot. You don't even need to waste your cloak cycle on them. Reload canceling is a must to get the most out of the gun. I find that when taking down bosses, I cloak &gt; overload &gt; fire &gt; reload cancel &gt; fire &gt; reload cancel with cloak &gt; overload &gt; fire &gt; etc.

Finally, you have some melee perks to give you an easy way of dealing with low-to-mid-tier enemies at close range without having to bother trying to hit them with your javelin. Nemesis? Combat engineer? Rocket trooper? Marauder? Any generic mook? Just cloak &gt; overload &gt; heavy melee and give them a one way ticket to **the motherfucking ground** via the **CHOKESLAM EXPRESS**. Not only does it look cool as shit and kill the enemy outright, but it gives you a 30% weapon damage boost to dump into the closest boss you can find.

So yeah, this guy is a lot of fun to play against geth and cerberus, and can do well against reapers too. Haven't tried him against the collectors, I always use the harrier against them, but I imagine there wouldn't be too many problems. This definitely is not the most powerful build for the class and I think assault rifles are a better all around choice for him, but this playstyle is an extremely fun and totally viable alternative for people looking to play a style closer to their disfigured mantis bro from single-player.

**EDIT:** For the record, a widow or kishock X would probably work just as well for those of you who don't have a javelin. Maybe even a mantis X if you really wanted to go full-on Garrus, though I don't recommend it. With your overload taking care of that shield gate, any single-shot rifle should have enough damage to one-shot what's left.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1350407909.0,,PC,True,t3_11ks3x,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11ks3x/archangel_turian_ghost_sniper/,

So let's organise a trustworthy team that won't use consumables in this thread. Send FRs, share tags on platforms, and organise times for runs. Even a team of two has a better chance than solo. Simple reason: BEs; getting a teammate up, setting up decoys/ one player acting as decoy etc.

So please add your tag, country (because of US/European time), platform, and time during the weekend when you'll be able to hook up with other players. I'll check in periodically and see if I can update the OP to add all the tags together.

1346187087.0,36,self.MECoOp,yzcd1,The Biotic Throwdown 2: Acolytric Throwgaloo,41,5,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/yzcd1/the_biotic_throwdown_2_acolytric_throwgaloo/,"So many of you will probably remember my [double-stuf-wall-of-text human sentinel thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/t1k15/the_biotic_throwdown_indepth_human_sentinel/?sort=confidence) from a few months ago. You will remember sentinel has been my favorite class since owning husks at lightspeed on the derelict reaper in ME2. However, there have been many advances in buffs/nerfs and just the overall state of the game since I posted it.

Human sentinel buff aside (I'm talking about the 30% power damage bonus tech armor has now, which really isn't even worth talking about aside from saying, ""hey cool"" because you all should already have maxed tech armor on him anyway), a lot of the recent metagame changes have come in the form of the new weapons classes being able to claim superiority over the powers classes when they deck themselves out in weapon amps, level IV ammo, etc. Up until literally yesterday, for the most part I agreed with it. Asari adept, drell adept, human sentinel and the like used to effortlessly rule over the infiltrators, engineers, and soldiers without even having to equip consumables 2 or 3 months ago. But today we live in the age of destroyers, demolishers, and basically any class with a piranha and shotgun amp III dominating the scoreboard.

It seemed as if the sun had set on my human sentinel. I would still take him out for a spin once every few days, peppering enemies with my phalanx to stagger them so I could hit them with a warp primer that they couldn't roll away from like I instructed all of you to do so long ago, but it just felt like so much *work*. Literally any enemy with shields would have to be primed for a biotic explosion to efficiently kill, and my favorite ability in the entire Mass Effect series, throw, was for the most part relegated to a biotic explosion detonator.

No more. **Do you hear me? NO. MORE.** The age of throwing is upon us, comrades! How, do you ask? Through the incorporation of one simple weapon, a weapon that I have seen receive very little recognition on this subreddit: the Acolyte.

You see, the Acolyte has this interesting property to it: a single shot completely removes the shields of any enemy that isn't an atlas or a geth prime on gold.

I'm going to say that again just to emphasize this for human sentinel players who didn't jump for joy out of their chairs the first time: **a single shot completely removes the shields of any enemy that isn't an atlas or a geth prime on gold.**

The new strategy for human sentinel: shoot with acolyte, throw. That's it. That's all you have to do for almost every standard unit in the game. Rocket troopers, centurions, hunters, nemeses, marauders, combat engineers? Remember when you had to go through all that bullshit to prime and detonate a biotic explosion on each one just to kill them? **SHOOT WITH ACOLYTE, THROW.** The enemy is now dead. Move on to the next one.

I used to think human sentinel wasn't viable for going up against gold cerberus because asari adept was so much better vs. phantoms because she had stasis. Yeah. Shoot with acolyte, throw. Even phantoms can't stand against this combo for long. Enjoy raping cerberus on gold, members of the sentinel brotherhood.

Remember how it used to take forever to get through the shields of atlases and geth primes with your biotic explosions? Remember how shields used to be the hard counter to biotic classes? Yeah, acolyte says what's up. Seriously, try it on any biotic class, be it asari adept, N7 fury, drell adept, whatever. An acolyte with extended barrel and extended mag (which to my knowledge are the only 2 mods that even do anything on this weapon) can take down the shields of an atlas or prime in a single clip without even having to stop to reload. So yeah, they can enjoy the 5 seconds or so they have shields before you shred their armor with warp/throw explosions.

In fact, targets with armor are now the only enemies you even *need* to use explosions on. Everything else can just get shot, then thrown. By the way, acolyte shots stagger the target, guaranteeing they won't be able to dodge-roll your throw (as if it wasn't good enough already). I hope you've all taken the top 3 options for 4-6 on throw ladies and gents, because you want to have the highest chance that your throw is going to one-shot the poor sap you just hit with an acolyte so you can move onto the next victim as quickly as possible like I did in the 10 or so rounds I dominated with my new and improved beast-mode human sentinel on gold last night. Geth hunters and phantoms tend to take 2 throws to kill, but I was playing completely vanilla with only a commando package V for gear. If you brought a power amp III along with you I'm positive nothing would be able to withstand a single one of your throws.

I'm almost reluctant to share this with you all because I don't want Bioware to nerf either the weapon or the class, but the new era of human sentinel domination cannot be denied. Throw has achieved its full potential, my friends. The geth are now officially a complete joke to human sentinel players. I almost feel bad for them. Really the only two enemies in the entire game who will give you problems are guardians and banshees with their bio-proof barriers up. Guardians can be killed by bringing a GPSMG with piercing mod and ULM V along as a second weapon (you still stay at 200%), and banshees...well, run away and unleash your onslaught onto whatever marauders, brutes, or ravagers you come across until you hear them scream and can resume nuking them with explosions.

Thanks for reading true believers, now equip that acolyte and get out there. Good hunting.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,PC,True,t3_yzcd1,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/yzcd1/the_biotic_throwdown_2_acolytric_throwgaloo/,

So anyway, I have taken a week long break from the game from playing it for at least one game after work every day. I play with a good friend of mine [(exxtrooper, who I actually initially met over PSN, including pics or didnt happen at Pulpit Rock)](http://imgur.com/a/4Svuv) who I actually happen to be visiting in Norway till tomorrow. 

Since my short hiatus from the game, we have been discussing weather its worth even to start playing again. 

Given Eric seems to be full of irrational decisions and flawed logic (I mean, nerfing things because of popularity?!) it seems like whenever new weaponry or a new tactic develops, it is a race against time to use it to its success before its nerfed into oblivion. The Krysae and Typhoon were two great examples of this, both of which have no reason to be used over say, a Gethfiltrator with Piranha on the higher difficulties. Not to even mention the rise and fall of the Falcon Assault rifle. Snipers are a shadow of their former selves and a potent sniper on Platinum is a very rare thing to see. 

Smash, tactical cloak and huntermode nerfs combined with things such as the Cerberus buffs and the infamous patch where *they buffed the geth* have made the higher difficulties not more difficult, but more annoying and time consuming. 

I often wonder why Eric decides that nerfing weapons and powers is a better idea than simply buffing the practically unusable weapons. It will always confuse me to why Geth Pulse Rifle/Plasma SMG/Disciple is in the same rarity tier as the Claymore/Geth Plasma Shotgun/Reegar Carbine/Piranha. Instead of nerfing the good weapons (And only a select few at that), why not just buff the bad weapons till they are actually usable on the higher difficulties?

Who actually enjoys playing a game which is managed like this? On paper, it sounds horrendous. Don't get me wrong, I have spent many an evening stealing peoples grenades and generally having a nice time playing with others, but now I have taken a week out, I am not sure I really want to return with the knowledge that two of my favorite classes are not as potent as before. 

Sorry that I have pretty much given you the 2nd new testament to read, but I felt that I had to write my concerns down. 

Have any of you given up on the multiplayer and why? On the flip side, for those who passionately play still, what keeps that flame burning? 

**TLDR: And so Eric said, there shall be no fun. We will oppress those who find enjoyment in the realms of Mass Effect 3 CoOp, and ban those who oppose us off our forums. And it was done.**

I'm here today to tell everyone why they're wrong (unless they already like it, in which case, continue reading with smug satisfaction).
&gt;
&gt;First, it is one of the most versatile guns in the game, with a true semi-auto firing mode it can spit lead (plasma?) as fast as one can spam the trigger. However, it can also be charged in a second to consume 3 rounds, each doing 3x damage, for a whopping 9x damage per shot - higher damage per shot than the Paladin. This allows one to stagger enemies getting too close, or to one-shot many mooks with a well placed headshot. It also has a higher magazine size and ammo reserve. One gets 6 fully charged shots versus the Paladin's 3. The charged shot also has an amazing chance to apply ammo powers, making a great fit for any tech class.
&gt;
&gt;This gun is also extremely accurate and possesses virtually no recoil when fired rapidly and an amount small enough to easily be re-aimed between charged shots. A fully charged shot with some form of piercing can easily take out a Guardian - and even without it can slay a Trooper, Cannibal, Nemesis, and potentially other enemies depending on gear and passives in a single shot. It can also quickly strip defences from Banshees/Atlases/Praetorians/etc.
&gt;
&gt;Finally, this gun is rather light, with a weight capacity upgrade or Pistol ULM any caster can get a 200% cooldown. Perfect since this gun is fantastic for Adepts who can have a bit of difficulty dealing with enemy shields. This gun allows one to get an enemy down to health/armor and really work those biotic explosions.
&gt;
&gt;So, this gun is powerful, versatile, accurate, and lightweight. It makes carrying a Pistol and SMG redundant as it fills both roles. It works as a great primary for any caster class and as a decent backup for anyone else. How can anyone have anything but love for such an amazing piece of work?

The builds listed will be built around my playstyle and should not be followed blindly. To help compensate for that, I will provide alternatives that will hopefully provide enough breadth so that you can find your niche with each kit.

I have a solid foundation on Soldiers in both a singleplayer and multiplayer aspect. I'm confident in using each Soldier, though some more than others. Those that I have relatively less comfort will be mentioned in their post. 

Each kit will have it's own comment inside this one and will follow this format. Any relevant posts will be hyperlinked in.

**Kit [Name](build link) [Ammo]** - A brief list of how the kit is setup.

**Build Goals**- a short description of how the build operates

**Why Weapon X**- weapon choice is as important as kit choice and thus deserves its own section.

**Minor Alterations**- Sometimes you just need minor alterations to a build to make it better for certain users.

**Ease of Use**- A rough estimate on how much margin of error you have when using it. Easier to use kits will have more room for mistakes than those that kits that are harder to use.

**Platinum Strength**- Most kits do fine on Gold- difficulties, but the boss rush on Platinum is a whole different level. This is related to Ease of Use, but the two aren't that integrated. For example, a low health/high DPS kit will be hard to use but have excellent Platinum strength.

**Alternative Builds**- Many kits will have other good builds to choose from and will be discussed here. 


__________________________________________________________________

On Soldiers in particular, they tend to have a good mix of DPS and meaty-ness that makes them great for users of all skill levels. One common feature amongst each Soldier is the reliance on weapons to get the best effectiveness. Fortunately, weight is not as important on Soldiers than it is on most other kits. In addition to that, each Soldier also works great with Tech teams in one way or another.

1364340296.0,38,self.MECoOp,1b2pcu,The Harry Callahan (N7 Destroyer Executioner Pistol),50,12,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1b2pcu/the_harry_callahan_n7_destroyer_executioner_pistol/,"***'I know what you're thinking. ""Did he fire two shots or only one?"" Well to tell you the truth, in all this excitement I've kinda lost track myself. But being that this is the Executioner, the most powerful heavy pistol in the galaxy and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: ""Do I feel lucky?"" Well, do ya punk?'***

----------------------------------------------------

To the veterans of this game, this will most likely not be news, but I figured it's time to immortalize this unholy combination for everyone to see in the Big Bad List of Builds.

As a single shot weapon, the Executioner pistol has been likened to a pocket Widow. It's a pretty nifty secondary that oozes badassness, but being a single shot gun there's a large margin for error and potentially dire consequences if you miss. So, how to get around this problem? There is but one man, one incredible warrior who is capable of taking this pistol and pushing it beyond its natural limits to an entirely new level of destruction. It's that fan favourite, the N7 Destroyer. Turn your pocket Widow into a pocket Black Widow!

The long and short of this trick is to abuse two magazine boosting mechanics to turn a one-shot gun into a two-shot gun. Unlike the Mantis, Widow, Javelin and Claymore, you can equip a Magazine Upgrade on the Executioner. At V this mod gives you 80% extra magazine capacity. Normally this will only give your Executioner a sleek black finish, because 80% isn't enough to turn 1 into 2. But Devastator Mode also grants magazine size increases. The base is 15%, with an additional 5% at rank 2. This gives you the 20% necessary to achieve a 100% mag size increase while active, thus allowing you to have a two-shot Executioner.

What does this mean? With all the damage upgrades available each shot is hitting for over 2,300 damage. This is enough to take out the shields of any Gold mook with one hit, thus exposing their health for the second shot to finish off. It also gives you a second chance should you miss your first shot. It tremendously increases your DPS against bosses. Most importantly, it turns the Executioner into a viable primary weapon instead of a backup. And you look like a fucking badass while doing it.

--------------------------------

[Build](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/NDestroyer/RAMNR/Executioner10AI5BK5/Striker10AC5AD5/PistolRailAmp3/StabilizationModule3/CombativesUpgrade5/)

-------------------------------

The build itself is pretty standard for the Destroyer. Unless you're packing a secondary that stands to really benefit from the additional 15% mag size bonus at rank 5, go with RoF. That 15% is wasted on the Executioner. RoF buffs significantly reduce the delay between shots. It actually feels like a proper two-shot gun instead of a modded one-shot. For secondaries, I roll with the Striker, it's my go-to anti-Phantom gun on the Destroyer, it's crude but very effective and adds to the badassness (this is of utmost importance). I would definitely recommend, as always, some anti-Phantom countermeasure as trying to take them out with any single-shot gun is fiddly work. If you're not a fan of the Striker, you can always opt for the GPS, Falcon, or Reegar. Of course, if you're confident in your Multifrags, then feel free to pack whatever secondary floats your boat.

As for equipment, I like to go with Drill rounds, because I have a whole stack of them and I like to save my AP rounds for lower damage per shot guns that stand to benefit more from the superior armour piercing rating, like the Harrier or Typhoon. I find Drill rounds are a good alternative for the less spammy weapons like the Saber. It also gives you 3 metres of penetration (Executioner has 50cm innate) so if you want to slap on the Geth Scanner you can blast shit through walls. It's a lot of fun with the Executioner. Obviously, for rail amps and gear go for pistol damage upgrades, you want to pump out as much damage as possible. I usually roll with Stabilisation Modules in my armour slot because it makes the gun much easier to handle, and again I have a sizable stack of them. Cyclonics are always a good option on the Destroyer though, to buff his tankiness through the roof, or Adrenaline Modules so you can circumvent the movement speed penalty from Devastator Mode.

----------------------------------

So, in conclusion, if you haven't already tried this setup, I urge you to do so. I fully acknowledge that for the Destroyer, it's not the best option. But it's definitely one of the best options for the Executioner, and it is a damn sight more fun than PPR spam. The Executioner is cool. It deserves a second chance.

1357924643.0,39,self.MECoOp,16dyx5,ME CoOp College races 102 - turians,49,10,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16dyx5/me_coop_college_races_102_turians/,"Note - read RepShred's base humans 101 before this, right neyah: http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16cugx/me3_coop_college_races_101_the_base_human_kits/


Welcome to coop races 102 - the turians.  Strong, durable, dodgeless, and all-around badass, there are five turians in CoOp.  Two are default, the sentinel and soldier, and three are from retaliation - the jet-packing jango fett turians, another soldier, an infiltrator and an engineer.


**Racials and Passives**

The turians are widely regarded as having some of the best passives in the game.  Both the regular and the armiger (jet packs!) have a standard weapon stability, making them great for unwieldy weapons like the revenant or typhoon.  

Their fitness is also very good.  The standard soldier and sentinel with full fitness can reach well over 1000 shields with the armigers getting slightly less than the regular turians.

The armigers are considered so godly because they have a huge dodge and a great heavy melee - making them very agile and badass looking.  While the regulars don't have the dodge, they make up for it with more health and shields.

**Turian Soldier**

The first one on the list is the basic soldier.  the TS can have up to 37.5% more weapon damage with the passives and has three powers that have good synergy - *Marksman, Proximity Mine, and Concussive Shot*.  This allows the TS to detonate bursts, making him good for tech teams and weapons teams.  However, the TS cannot self-detonate.

* The first power is Marksman, which increases accuracy and stability for a few seconds, at the expense of not being able to use a power.  A good counterpoint to the humans AR.  Marksman also refills ammo, so a tactic people use is just as the clip empties, the TS pops Marksman and more shooting is had.  
* The second power is Proximity mine, or proxy mine.  A power that can deal a decent amount of damage, but its greatest ability is 5a, which increases damage to a target by 20% for 8 seconds.  Good for bosses, making them more vulnerable for the team.
* the third power is conc. shot, which is demonstrated in RepShred's HS build.  Most people will usually go three deep or not at all.

Most builds are weapons builds, unsurprisingly.  There is some choice in the passives but most of the builds are the same. 

**Turian Sentinel**

Widely considered a versatile sentinel and a very good team player in the hands of even an inexperienced player.  The sentinel has the same passives as the soldier, and can get 35% more power damage from its passives.  The sentinel's powers are *Tech Armor, Warp, and Overload*.  With these powers, the Tsent can set up tech bursts and BE's, and detonate every kind of burst.  And excellent team player.

* Tech Amor makes the TSent into more of an unstoppable badass of badassery with 30% more power damage with the rank 5 evolution.

* Warp and Overload are the same as in RepShred's post.  

There are several variations on the TSent.  Some people drop warp, or overload, or fitness, there's great variation. Usually if people drop a power, they equip the TSent with a heavier weapon.

DLC classes time!

**Turian Havoc Soldier**

One of the Retaliation classes, the Havoc is an unwieldy but effective class.  A pseudo-vanguard with *Havoc Strike, the amazing Stim Packs and the great de-buffer of Cryo Blast*, the Havoc is an undervalued but effective soldier.

* Havoc Strike is basically like charge, without the shield boost.  Getting it to rank 4 with power upgrades brings it over the 1000N bridge to get phantoms, and deals a very good amount of damage all around.  There's also a bug where right after a charge you heavy melee, there's no cool down.  Cool.

* Stim packs - the saving grace of the soldier.  Giving a giant shield boost and raise, up to 2400 shields, and giving a slight damage boost, most players usually use it right after a havoc strike, to imitate a biotic charge.  There is some lag when using it, so be careful.

* Cryo blast - an excellent debuffer that primes a cryo blast and slows enemies down.  While some people look down on the power, it is a very underrated power that is often overlooked.

Like most turians, there is a lot of variations in the builds.  Some people ignore Havoc Strike, while others ignore cryo blast.  While also boasting the stability buffs of all turians, the soldier is an underrated but formidable turian.  Not the best, but not the worst.

**Turian Ghost Infiltrator**

Here it is.  The ""Garrus"" class, just with added jet packs and a badass version of *tac cloak, overload and stim packs*.  The Ghost is an extremely powerful infiltrator and when equipped with a harrier or other type of weapon becomes a force of nature on the battlefield.

* tac cloak - similar to the other infiltrators, but with a twist - the 6th evolution gives a 20% damage boost to assault rifles for ten seconds - making a harrier even better.  

* stim packs - the same as the havoc's.  Still badass and makes the turian very durable.

* Overload.  See first post linked to top.

There are few builds about the ghost that vary greatly.  Most efficient builds drop fitness altogether, instead relying on the base 750 shields and the amazingness of stim packs.  Efficient against all enemies, it is unsurprising that the Ghost is one of the best infiltrators in the game.

**Turian Saboteur Engineer**

And here is the last turian, which is widely considered one of the worst of the groups.  With an awkward combo of powers of *sentry turret, sabotage, and homing grenades*, most people are disappointed with the saboteur.  However, the Saboteur has a lot of potential and power when used with team mates and friends.  Allons-y!

* Sentry turret - throw a turret and let it go to town.  An efficient decoy that can be upgraded with rockets or a flamethrower, it also points in the direction of enemies, letting you be aware of that sneaky hunter COMING UP RIGHT BEHIND YOU OH GOD SHOOT IT

* sabotage - make enemies' weapons backfire (wounding them) and take control of robots.  Good against all factions (especially geth and cerberus), sabotage can kill an enemy without you shooting.  Can prime a TB, and the amazing final evolution that increases tech damage by 50% to a target for 10 seconds.

* homing grenade - a grenade that absolutely destroys armor.  Can deal a lot of damage to enemies, especially if used after sabotage, detonating a TB and dealing an inordinate amount of damage to a target.

Great against geth (hack the pyros and hunters first, primes take too long) and cerberus (turrets are your friends), most people drop sentry turret or go into a traditional 66653.  

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the turians are a great race.  With awesome stability buffs, great synergy with powers and team mates.  As I once saw, turians have a reputation of being hardy, efficient, and good team members capable of tanking, shooting and destroying as good as the Destroyer.  Next time - quarians.

1357447960.0,39,self.MECoOp,161nrp,Killer Hips - the FQI Melee Build,47,8,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/161nrp/killer_hips_the_fqi_melee_build/,"The figure of the Female Quarian never ceases to amaze. Our subject today must focus on it's capacity for melee wreckage. She doesn't have the brute strength of a Krogan or the Biotic boost of a Vanguard, the only augmentation she employs is her trusty Tech.

[Here](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/Quarian/MMPAK/ATRaider10BG5BH5//StrengthEnhancer3/AdrenalineModule4/BerserkerPackage5/) is the build that I use.

Powers:
Sabotage - 6: Backfire/Explosive/Vulnerability - I list this power first because it is what makes the build unique. The Vulnerability Evolution affects the Omni-Blade heavy melee of the FQI (and other classes with the same type). This adds an additional boost to melee damage that other classes don't have access to. I choose Explosive because Sabotage will mostly be cast from Cloak, so recharge is meaningless.

Tactical Cloak - 6: Duration/Melee/Bonus Power - Duration is excellent for objectives and allows you to take your time running in to make your move. Bonus Power allows you to use Sabotage to neutralize an enemy from a distance and then move in for the kill while remaining cloaked.

Sticky Grenade - 6: Damage/Armor Pierce/Damage - The beauty of the Melee build is that it makes this grenade easy to place. It should be used carefully, since this build only allows for a capacity of 2.

Quarian Defender - 0: The only build I use that doesn't use the passive tree.

Fitness - 6: Melee/Martial Artist/Power Synergy - The obvious melee build choices. I would have liked this class a little better if it had Weapon Synergy, but having a nearly constant 25% boost to grenades and Sabotage is nothing to sneeze at.

Weapon of Choice: Raider with the Omni-Blade and High Velocity Barrel - The Raider fires fast enough to get both shots off with the Cloak bonus *after* the Melee attack, so it's maximum potential is reached. You'll find that the Heavy Melee will deal with most enemies on it's own, but you can afford the weight of a decent shotgun. Another great choice is the Wraith, which gives you better range.

Equipment: Berserker Package; Strength Enhancer; Adrenaline Module really helps with getting in and out of the fray; Ammo - Incendiary. The gun is only used when the enemy survives the melee - the only things that survive have armor, so focus your weapon towards shredding armor. Cryo is useful because it softens up big armored targets for your next melee attack.

Strategy: Cloak, Sabotage, Heavy Melee, repeat. The focus target damage capabilities are fantastic. You get a total of 4 temporary melee damage boosts, plus significant passive boosts, as well. Choose your targets carefully and you will rarely take damage. The heavy melee will lock on from a decent range, so take advantage of that. It's actually much easier to hit an enemy that is a few paces from you than one that is right next to you and manages to slip past you mid-animation. It acts as a gap-closer so that you can follow up with your shotgun. However, lean towards caution when deciding whether to keep blasting away or to retreat and live to slash another day.

Tip: If you Sabotage an enemy, but then can't go in for a kill, melee the air to end your Cloak early so that you can reset the cycle faster.

Strengths: Single target burst damage; Low Ammo Consumption; CQC master; Survivability

Weaknesses: Hunters are very annoying because it is tricky to hit them with sabotage and your heavy melee won't lock on while they are cloaked; Open spaces; Long range

1357338017.0,38,self.MECoOp,15z2nl,Finished Best of the Best Banner: Thoughts and Tips,47,9,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/15z2nl/finished_best_of_the_best_banner_thoughts_and_tips/,"I've been working at this banner for a while, and finally finished getting it last night. There were a lot of random things I picked up on the way that would have really helped in streamlining the process, so I thought I'd share some of my thoughts, and create a place for you to share yours. Anyway, I'll try to keep things organized by going in the order of the challenges window, top to bottom, left to right. Hopefully, the formatting will not be too awful.

**General**

* Make a plan for each of the challenges. Most do not require each sub-challenge completed, so check to see how many you need and go for those specifically.
* Try to complete multiple challenges at once. This is obvious, but keeping track of a character with which you need to complete waves, a weapon for which you need points, and a map/difficulty that needs some more waves will really help to chip away at these.
* Don't double dip. Finished your 200 waves with a TGI? Great. Move on to your Volus Engineer.
* Most importantly, don't let the challenges rule your gameplay. If you start solo gold missions to hunt down husks, you'll start to hate your life.

**Squad Elite**

* This is a pretty straightforward one. Your basic trade-off is higher difficulty extractions vs. number of weekend events completed. If you're on this sub, then you probably knock out lots of events, so this will come naturally with time. No need to focus on this one.

**Spectre Mastery**

* My advice would be to avoid grinding this one. If you play lots of bronze, points will definitely come last.  Consistent gold/silver playing will more or less even out all of the sub-challenges.

**Solo Mastery**

* Harder difficulties count for lower difficulties. This challenge can be completed by doing 2 solo gold, 3 silver, and 5 bronze.
* Work your way up in difficulty.
* Easy solo gold builds include Kroguards, TGI, geth (as an enemy), cyclonic modulator IV, and a map that you are really comfortable on. The most important thing is to be patient.
* Don't listen to haters. Kroguard/Glacier/Geth/Gold is still something most people can't do. Be proud of yourself.

**N7 Mastery**

* ALWAYS PROMOTE!
* If you consider how many classes need 200 waves, this is not bad if you're never playing a level 20 character.
* Related to the above, it's good strategy to have different characters of the same class that you like at high or low levels. For instance, I played a Krogan Sentinel at low levels, and Valkyrie at high levels to get 200 waves for each, while leveling up my sentinel for promotion.
* Recruit packs are a viable grinding method if you must.

**Map Mastery**

* Shoot for 100 gold waves on all but your two least favorite maps.  For me, this was everything except Goddess and Condor, for which I did 100 (painful) silver waves.
* Like solo mastery, gold completes silver and bronze challenges.
* If you use the box of shame on platinum Rio, you can get out of doing another map on gold (I would suggest Reactor).

**Biotic/Tech Mastery**

* Do this after you've finished all of your character waves, as a lot of these will happen in the process.
* I also recommend skipping tech armor damage.

**Resurgence-Retaliation Mastery**

* Opt for the weapon/map extraction sub-challenges. Both can be combined with weapon mastery and map mastery challenges and go pretty quickly.
* Pick your favorite characters (the ones you'll do 200 waves with) for the 10 extraction sub-challenges.
* It is worth noting that the Earth (N7) characters are not eligible for any 200 wave challenges.

**Bloodpack-Outsider Mastery**

* Opt first for the ability and weapon sub-challenges. The ability ones can go very quickly.
* Basically, your goal here, if aiming for efficiency, is to only play the minimum number of waves with the minimum number of characters to get these challenges.
* Get started on Commando Mastery early on. Even if you do all of the ability/weapon subs, you've still got 1400 waves to go.

**Weapon Mastery**

* Consider two things: What are my favorite weapons? Which weapons do I need for the Alien Mastery challenges?
* The scimitar is painful, IMO. Skip if you can.
* Always carry an SMG or pistol with ultralight materials, for which you need points, as a sidearm. If you finish getting points with your primary weapon mid-round, switch guns. The low weight won't really impact your cooldown, and you'll be more efficient this way.
* If you have trouble with a specific weapon or weapon type, use a character with a stun power. Suck at sniping? Do it with and infiltrator that has overload or E-drain to slow your target down.
* If working solely on an SMG challenge, I strongly recommend using an amp. A lot of the weaker ones will really drag the challenge out due to low damage. If you're like me, you have a lot of SMG amps lying around anyway.

**Cerberus-Collector Mastery**

* There were four types of units that took a while for me: Guardian, Nemesis, Husk, Praetorian. It may be different for you, but if you start to notice that one is lagging behind, make an extra effort to hunt them down.
* Praetorians were particularly bad for me, and after burning out on Collectors on bronze, I decided to just rocket 3-4 of them on the first wave of solo platinum. At ~2500 points each, it was a much better way to get those last 50k points. Collectors irritate me, so I did grind the end of this one.
* There are really good links for ""farming"" Guardians and Husks somewhere in this subreddit recently. That said, avoid farming if possible. It can become painful.

**TL;DR**: I have lots to say about how I did the challenges, and some of it may even be useful.

I don't think it should be full-on immunity like devastator mode; I'd make them resistant to projectile attacks coming from the front like geth prime blasts/rockets/shotguns/scion cannons, but I think they should still get staggered by melee attacks like normally. It would be nice to be able to maintain firing while enemies are returning fire, and would make the classes able to take better advantage of guns like the typhoon and PPR.

I think it would make choosing between old and new turians a more balanced choice that boils down more to how you want to play. The armigers can be more evasive and dodge attacks, whereas the classic ones can be tankier and draw enemy fire while still attacking.

Impressive technical potential.,44,4,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1545zn/volus_viable_possibility_impressive_technical/,"I remember how I scoffed when reports showed that the volus might be playable races in mass effect multiplayer. I dismissed these leaks as troll-crafted fabrications. After all, how much damage could a tiny volus possibly inflict?

The answer is shitloads. Literally unbelievable amounts of carnage. I'm going to cover the volus engineer in this post, but I hope to produce guides to the sentinel and adept later on. I'm not going to try to produce a definitive build, but I will discuss the various options in each of your powers, tell you a few things you might not know about them, and discuss what weapons may suit these portly guardians of Irune's honour.

Also, I'd like to say that I want to be the best volus possible, so if you find anything controversial or you have extra advice, let me have it.

My build is [here](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Engineer/Volus/IPPPD/Scorpion10BA5AJ5/CollectorSMG10BB5AV5/SMGRailAmp3/AdrenalineModule3/ExpertPackage5/). I have soloed gold with it (Geth/Giant, Reaper/White and Cerberus/White). Take it from me - it is ""gold viable"" (this is a stupid term, but whatever) and actually has a fairly low skill ceiling. Discussion follows:

**RECON MINE**

A fairly large debuffing power, recon mine also produces perhaps the greatest damage of all non-grenade powers (smash can outdo it under certain circumstances).

You can deploy the mine to walls, ceilings and floors and it will highlight all enemies within its scanning range. Tap the key a second time after the mine arms (this currently takes 3 seconds) and the recon mine explodes. Key facts:

* the explosion isn't blocked by cover, no matter how thick.
* you do not need to be off cooldown to explode the mine. I have a six and a half second cooldown on my RM. I can deploy the mine, detonate it 3 seconds later, and put up another 3 and a half seconds after that.
* The explosion hits for substantial force. In order to staggar a banshee (necessary if a teammate is about to be insta-killed), you need force of 1500N on gold and 2000N on platinum. 1500N is the *base* force of recon mine. As long as you can find 33% in power damage bonuses somewhere, you *will* be able to staggar even a platinum banshee (lag and reaction time affect this of course). Granted this requires some luck or foresight, but it is often quite easy to predict when someone is about to be grabbed.*
* the slow part of the debuff evolution in rank 6 is deceptively useful. Frequently you can arrange for an entire spawn point to be slowed down while you help the rest of the team with the objectives. Taking 5 of the eight enemies out of circulation is very helpful. This is also quite useful for your teammates' AoE attacks (although on objective waves it would be even better if they just left the buggers alone and sat quietly in the hack circle). The slow evolution comes with a fantastic 25% debuff as well. 
* Debuffs in this game are added together on top of the something peddroelmz calls the headshot mod. So if I hit someone with incinerate for 900 damage, and that person is affected by proxy mine's 20% debuff, and recon mine's 25%, I do (900 * 1.45) 1305 damage. If someone hits that person with a headshot with their grall spike thrower for 2138 damage, they'll do (2138 * (3 + 0.45)) 7376 damage. The headshot mod is the headshot multiplier of the weapon (usually 2.5, but sometimes 3 or 1) if the damage was from a weapon headshot, or one otherwise.
* Recon mine + proxy mine does not exactly nuke spawns, but at the end of the wave, you should consider replacing your mine so that it covers the area the enemy spawns in. Slowing them down and making them take 25% extra damage from the grenades your teammates will inevitably be throwing at them is a very powerful asset for any team.
* Recon mine debuffs from different players do not stack: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/14108056#14108056

**PROXIMITY MINE**

* Fire a proxy mine and have it stay active on a surface for 30 seconds. Any enemy entering the radius sets off the mine and takes damage. Those whose staggar thresholds are below 300N (or 360N at rank 3) are staggared.
* I take 5 ranks - radius and damage taken. Radius helps me staggar enemies. If I find myself swarmed, I can proxy, cloak and escape. It also helps keep teammates safe from possessed abominations, melee attacks, and death-cycle clusterfucks (although I still advise using shield boost if you're close, or perhaps even a missile). The 20% extra damage makes proxy probably a better debuff than cryo blast (which has a max duration of 6s, I believe, and doesn't set off tech combos).
* Proxy mine will probably be what you're spamming both in good groups and if you're soloing. Good players tend not to need shield boost too much (although if you notice a competent player dying a lot, be liberal with it) and tend to prefer their support to come in the form of killing things more quickly. 
* Proxy mine also sets off tech explosions (and you can exploit this yourself if you're on your own and have disruptor/incendiary ammo). These do a fair amount of damage - a tech burst with rank 5 proxy and some disruptor ammo does 675 damage to enemy health and twice that to shields on gold, and does this in a small AoE.
* Proxy mine bonuses from the *same* player do not stack. Proxy mine damage bonuses from different players *do* stack: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/14108056#14108056

**SHIELD BOOST**

* Despite the volus engineer mainly being a debuffer, your teammates are entitled to have you use this ability. Spamming it, and doing nothing else is a rather annoying way to play. Instead you should look out for dialogue like ""power!"", ""lost shields!"", ""I'm hit!"", ""PAAAIN!""
* shield boost and the volus heavy melee will together give you two seconds of damage immunity and around 90% DR. I've survived a meltdown in the hazard reactor using this - give it a try! Spoiler: the room goes a lovely pure white, and enemies continue attacking you during the meltdown.
* shield boost, like any ability that restores shields, gives immunity for dot effects. Use just before or after banshee warps or novas, or squadmates going through ravager puddles.
* Characters have a shorter shield recharge time if their shields have not been completely destroyed. Because shield boost restores a small amount of shields for 3 seconds after cast, teammates should be able to duck into cover and take advantage of this shortened delay.
* The description for evolution 6 of shield boost says that damage reduction is capped at 90%. According to tyhw on the BSN, this is in fact a lie. Shield boost and other powers that together total 133% can give you total immunity (claim found here: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15284691/2#15286402)
* Evolution 5 is incomprehensibly bad. What would you rather have? 170 shields per second for 6 seconds or 170 shields per second for 3 seconds AND take 37.5% less damage from all sources? Easy choice, no? If anyone can think of a scenario where the former is more useful, please let me know.
* There's a bug with shield boost. Having a volus near you activate it while you're reloading causes you to be locked out of powers and firing your gun. Volus affected by this bug are locked out of heavy melee as well. The cure is to heavy melee. Falling off a ledge also works.
* Finally damage reduction of 50% does not reduce all incoming damage by one half. The damage reduction percentage is itself reduced by a quarter. See here - social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/11481777
* The amount of shields delivered in a lump on activation is a little strange - unlike the extra shields over 3 seconds, it appears to increase with power damage bonuses. This is a little strange, because it makes one of the options in rank 5 of your first passive almost useless. I've asked peddroelmz to investigate, and see if this is merely a glitch with the character screen, or whether it actually has some effect in game.

**MELEE**

* Information about the melee comes from corlist: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15123388#15123388. I've also looked through the settings in the coalesced file (Also [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/143jkv/volus_meleeshield_boost_mechanics/) is the reddit discussion about that article)
* regular/light melee gives you a 4 second cloak that isn't broken by reviving, shooting or using powers. Remember that as with the infiltrator's tactical cloak, you can't just cloak and have enemies stand around perfectly still like they used to do in mass effect 2. Enemies will continue to fire at where they saw you last, in the blind hope that they'll catch you. You might also intercept bullets fired at your teammates. Rockets and warps fired at you before you cloaked continue to follow you (you should use heavy melee to tank those). And finally, geth rocket drones completely ignore all cloaks. This cloak is on a 6 second cooldown counted from the moment you trigger it. Unlike other cloaks, firing your gun, reviving and using powers won't break it. Also your shields will recharge while cloaked. 
* This ""ghetto cloak"" gives you one of your best tools for survival and for revives. Frequent and efficient use of it is basically the key to surviving as a volus on gold. As Alec Baldwin's character in Glengarry Glen Ross might have said, had he not been sent by Mitch and MUrray to a failing branch office, but instead been tasked with the instruction of a roomful of volus N7 operatives ""A B C. A always B be C cloaking. Always be cloaking"".
* Your heavy melee gives you 1 second immunity to all damage and regenerates 10% of your shields. It also gives you around 55% DR. Remember that regaining some of your shields means that you have a 3 second wait until your shields start regenerating rather than a 4 second wait, so this is fairly useful and often makes up for the lack of fitness rank 5's reduction in shield recharge delay.
* The heavy melee puts out 600N of force. This is enough to staggar a dragoon (250N threshhold), a pyro (390N threshhold) or a collector captain (125N). Those enemies really like to get close, so don't forget that you have this ability. Remember though that dragoons don't seem to be able to be staggared out of their lunge animation.
* Use heavy melee if you've been hit by a DoT effect and you don't want to use shield boost.
* volus cannot be grabbed by husks and abominations. And they can also use heavy melee to damage and repel them

**KIT LIMITATIONS AND ADVANTAGES**

* Volus are often in cover even while standing up. You can hide behind cover, fire at the enemy over cover and - as long as he isn't higher up than you - his attacks will hit the cover in front of you.
* ""Right-hand advantage"" is standing so that your crosshairs are on the enemy but your body is in cover. Exploiting this is the second key to volus survivability. It's quite frequent that I can fire at, say, the tops of enemies heads while I stand at the bottom of the staircase they're coming down and their gun will be hitting the top of the ramp. This is a little cheezy, but it's really the way volus are meant to be played.

Recently I've been playing Platinum difficulty with the usual team. Of the last 13 platinum matches I had 13 extractions, and most were full extractions. We played Unknown/Cerberus/Platinum. We had some variations on the team, but in every case we were tech heavy. Here's some things I noticed:

* 3 Engineers + 1 Infiltrator is a really good combination
* 1 Volus Engineer is *really* helpful
* Quarian Female Infiltrator helps a lot with the Sabotage Tech vulnerability
* Incendiary rounds are a good choice because they prime fire explosions
* Collectors wont show up if you don't choose them specifically. They have resistance to combos.

For engineers, Quarian Males, Quarian Females, Salarians, Humans all work well. Turian Sentinel is also a boss due to having both Overload (best exploder) and Warp (one of the best debuffs / exploders). Demolisher is very useful on some maps, like Condor, where the ammo boxes are very stingy. 

The idea is to have debuffs (Volus mines, cryoblasts, tac scans, even Warp if someone runs a Turian sentinel, Sabotage) and tech / fire combos spam going *and* also bring the most powerful guns you have: Talons, Harriers, Hurricanes, Acolytes (for shield strip).

The firepower is so ridiculous that a Platinum Atlas can be taken down in about one second after the shields are gone. 

Objectives rely on Infiltrator (activate 4) or group movement with volus shield recharge and, yes, missiles. 

All in all, with a good team not much more difficult than Gold, especially since the shieldgate glitch has been less common on Platinum than gold (the effect where sometimes youŕ dude just dies instantly to mook shots).

1350482311.0,34,self.MECoOp,11moae,Well here I come I'm poppin' Barriers on your ass bitch! - Krogan Shaman Adept build,39,5,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11moae/well_here_i_come_im_poppin_barriers_on_your_ass/,"*Preface: So this is a technique I've been using on my singleplayer Vanguards for quite a while now. It's obviously better in SP since Liara's Warp has instant transmission and doesn't run off your own cooldowns. With that said, I've honed it down to a T in MP now and I feel I'm ready to share this awesomely fun Barrier technique with you guys.*

*Note: Unless stated otherwise, detonate simply means the blast effect from Barrier, not an actual biotic explosion.*

One of the best things about the Adept class is its ability to not only dish out fucktons of damage with the biotic good stuff, but also have good crowd control capabilites. For the asari, it's Stasis, for the Drell it's Cluster Grenades and Pull, for the humans it's Singularity. Being able to render enemies completely helpless, harmless and vulnerable to an easy BE finisher has always made the Adept shine when compared to other biotics on the field. So initially I was a little disappointed with the Krogan Shaman's moveset because while he has the uber-powerful Warp-Shockwave combo, he lacks any obvious CC move. But then I remembered that Barrier has a detonation, which I know from playing SP is amazing for CC. Allow me to elaborate:

* Barrier has an extremely short cooldown - at 200% recharge, it's only 1.85 seconds. Not as fast as Throw or Pull but still, anything under 2 seconds is extremely valuable. This means if need be, you can spam it. Double tap Barrier (ie. activate, detonate) for an almost instant detonation. Only the detonation of Barrier initiates a cooldown, which is why double tapping is so useful.

* The detonation specced out right has a radius of 5.4m and literally sends unshielded mooks *flying*. Pop a barrier in a tight situation to instantly propel your attackers to the other side of the map. And unlike in singleplayer, the detonation does a sizeable chunk of damage, so you can kill stuff outright if you want. Unfortunately it won't hit enemies through walls or behind cover but that's not a massive hindrance.

* Suspending an enemy primes them for a biotic explosion. Self explanatory. Coupled with the detonate evolutions for Warp and Shockwave, it's pretty much a one-two combo that will kill anything short of armoured targets that come into your vicinity.

* If it doesn't suspend an enemy, the detonation is a very reliable stagger. As in, it will always stagger a Phantom if she has barriers up (if she doesn't she'll be blown away) and it will always stagger a Dragoon unless if he's in Smash animation. And if he is, a Krogan Headbutt to the face will stun him out of it. Due to the AoE nature of the blast, you can stagger whole groups, which can keep them pinned down while you send your Warp or Shockwave out to catch the unlucky soul who got suspended. And since it's on a short cooldown, double tapping Barrier is as fast and more efficient than the Falcon. If something still has shields, you can detonate and stagger their protection away no problem. Acolyte's better for stripping that shit though.

So with this in mind, I've crafted [this](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#07MPQIDp9%400AE%40%40H4I4%400%400) build.

Since you're using Barrier as a primarily offensive tool, you'll want that blast effect evolution. I went for power recharge on the final evolution over more damage protection for the times you'll want it up against bosses and you're forced to sit in cover like a normal Adept and spam BEs. The faster you can get those things off, the better.

If you're on PC, don't spec into Radius on Shockwave as it apparently breaks the power in some way (according to Xcal). I went for lifting Shockwave just for that extra bit of CC. Be warned that while it can prime BEs, it's not very reliable as there's a very short window for you to get a Warp in to detonate. You pretty much have to be right on top of them to hit them with Warp in time, as once they start to fall down, you've missed your chance. Unlike Barrier, which gives you more than enough time to hit them.

Warp evolutions are self explanatory and if you do it any other way, you're doing it wrong.

What I like most about this build is it combines both an offensive and defensive strategy, depending on the enemy type. As the Shaman is essentially the lovechild of Kroguard and Vanilla Adept, you get to blend the two playstyles into one, which makes it a hell of a lot of fun to play. You get to play him like a krogan, so you don't forsake your Tuchankan heritage, but you can also dish out powerful combos from a safe distance. So the basic strategy is: against mooks, strip any shields with the Acolyte, charge in, pop barrier and Warp or Shockwave suspended targets for easy BEs. Works great on Phantoms, both the suspension and stagger aspects. For armoured targets, sit in cover, strip any shields with the Acolyte, and Warp-Shockwave to death. Takes out Dragoons pretty fast, and if they get dangerously close, double tap Barrier or headbutt to stagger and buy yourself a bit of time to get those primers and detonators off. Warp-headbutt-Shockwave is the GGNoRe 3-hit combo for Dragoons.

With regards to When Do I Want To Keep Barrier On?, I would say it's always good to have up for what damage resistance you can get, seeing as this guy isn't quite as tanky as Kroguard. You'll definitely want to minimise the time you're missing out on the DR.

So, that's pretty much it. Tl;dr Barrier is an amazing CC power, don't skip over it!

1349848943.0,40,self.MECoOp,118nfg,Item Drop Rates for PSPs - Preliminary Data,40,0,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/118nfg/item_drop_rates_for_psps_preliminary_data/,"First of all, thanks to everyone for contributing data for this.  We ended up with about 19 million credits worth of data, which is a pretty decent sample size.  Some of the numbers I'm going to link are pretty robust, others are subject to a fairly high degree of uncertainty.

I've organized this the information in a pie chart [here](http://imgur.com/kH9wW).  Rather than think of this in terms of percentages, I think it makes more sense to think about the number you are expected to get for any given item, for a specific number of PSPs.  This is because you can get more than one of a given item category in a single pack.  Anyway, for this chart, I scaled it to expected number of items per 100 PSPs.  This distribution assumes you have none of the item categories maxed.  Obviously, once that happens, the probabilities change (but in a fairly predictable way).

Now, coming up with this required a fair amount of fudging, as not everyone reported the same items, so I had to calculate likelihoods for each item type individually.  Also, in some cases, people maxed out a category, which mucks up the percentages.  In any case, the results pass a basic sanity check.  Out of 100 PSPs, we expect to get 500 total items.  The items listed here add up to 502, so that is reassuring.

But, let's get to the good stuff.  Here are my main takeaways from the data:

* *Ultra-Rares appear to have an increased likelihood.*  In this set of data, nearly 30% of the PSPs bought contained some type of UR.  Now, the Volus messes this up, as it accounts for about 35% of the URs unlocked here.  Even if you take the Volus out, 17.5% of the PSPs had an UR.  That's quite high, but we should note that the sample size means that the margin of error is pretty high on this.  Specifically, we can be 95% confident that the expected number of UR weapons in a PSP is between 0.12 to 0.23.  Even if it's as low as 0.12, I'm pretty sure that's better than it was in the past.  More data would help narrow down this range (I'm looking at you, RepublicanShredder, with your 8.3 million credits).

* *You can now expect a Rare Gear and Weapon Mod in about 2/5 PSPs.*  For gear, this must be an improvement, right?  I have mostly been buying SPs prior to this DLC, but that's a very high number.  I think they may have rebalanced the Gear likelihoods after they became nearly impossible to get.  For the Weapon Mods, take it with a grain of salt, as it seems those weren't released until the balance changes came out, so people who bought PSPs really early after the DLC didn't get them.  My sample on those was only 37 PSPs.

* *Rare weapons unlock at a higher rate than Rare characters.*  This may have been the case before, but I never kept track.  The numbers on these are pretty robust - it looks like you get expect 0.5 Rare characters per PSP and 0.67 Rare weapons per PSP.


The Volus add a fair amount of uncertainty into the UR discussion.  It will be interesting to see what happens once people max them out.  I really doubt URs are going to unlock at a 30% rate once you do.  Purely speculation, but I suspect the way the UR algorithm works is for each slot, the first thing it does is check if you get an UR weapon, using, say at 15% probability.  Then, if that fails, check for an UR character, say at 12% probability (this would match the pattern of Rare characters being less likely than Rare weapons).  Then, if that fails, move on to your checks for Rare guns.  Anyway, if something like this is the case, then after maxing the Volus, your weapon likelihoods shouldn't change as a result.

Since many people here will soon be maxing their Rare characters and weapons, it's worth noting how this distribution will change.  Fortunately, it's fairly predictable and simple - all that likelihood just gets dumped into Level IV ammo and other equipment.  The rest of the chart should probably be pretty self-explanatory.

~~Finally, a note for those looking to get the best bang for your buck:  The new Rare character items seem to be bugged in the RNG - you can still get them even if you've maxed them out.  After maxing them, you may want to consider holding off on buying packs until this is resolved (or not, who knows how long it will take).~~  Ignore this paragraph, the issue has apparently been fixed.

Anyway, thanks again to everyone who contributed.  If people want to continue sending me their drop rates, I'll continue compiling them and update the numbers.  It's probably not worth reporting less than about 0.5 million credits.  Also, I'd like to eventually get some data on SPs, as I wasn't able to get a large enough sample to draw any meaningful conclusions here.

One more thing, I promise.  The time of day stuff was way too granular to do anything useful with.  It would take an enormous sample to come up with anything meaningful here.  Frankly, I would be really, really surprised if they changed probabilities by time of day.

The whole point of this build is to basically play Whack-a-mole, and your teammates are the hammer, the enemies are the mole, and the Tac Scan is the impulse that brings the hammer down. Speaking of teammates, take a good long look at them. See how they bravely ride out into the thick of battle, creating a skirmish so legendary that [Sabaton](http://youtu.be/D_m8GTuKuzQ) would make a song out of it. Take one more long look. 

That is not you.

You shall know no glory. You are the Otacon to the rest of the team's Solid Snake. The Medic to their Heavy. The SkyEye to Garuda Team. The Anya to their Marcus Fenix. The Cortana to their Master Chief. Yours is not to fight, yours is to die screaming like a girl while hopelessly taking potshots at them. Your inability to take a hit leaves you in the back of the bunch, and your skills basically relegate you to the guy that yells “KILL THAT GUY YOU NOOB! NO NOT THAT GUY, THE OTHER GUY” except you lack a mic (supposedly) and a neckbeard (supposedly).

The game plan is basically hole up somewhere with a good view, and call targets. You may occasionally take potshots with your sniper rifle, but other than that, that is really it. If there is a good chunk of guys near you, throw a grenade to get a few more assists points. If you find a lot of mooks try and shove an assault rifle up your ass, you have two options.

1) Cloak and run away, hide somewhere else.
2) Failing the above, bending over and taking that assault rifle like a champ. 

You are a quarian, a good strong breeze will take out your shields. You cannot stand your ground, unless you just gonna give and die without at least breaking an arm at the enemies. 

For weapons, for providing a so much as a tickle to the enemy, bring along a nice big sniper rifle. Cooldowns are not a problem, since Tac Scan takes a few seconds to cooldown, Arc Grenades have no cooldown, and the only time you will ever use tactical cloak is when you are sniping or running away. So pack a Widow and Revenant, it won't help. But it will help you be less of “that guy.”

My list of actions that would deter the kick or credit loss would be:

* Using powers (maybe not just using it, but using it on an enemy)
* Dealing damage to an enemy
* Killing an enemy
* Taking part in an objective (like hacking), or activating an objective
* Reviving a team-mate

What does r/MECoOp think? Hopefully this would deter leachers and promote more teamwork.

This post is help those of you who don't know of this and I hope it can help you in multiplayer.

I have tested this technique in multiplayer with the only heavy weapons I have (M-99 Saber and Widow). However this technique seems to work on all of the weapons that I have in singleplayer.

**Definition:** A *reload cancel* is a technique used by many shooters that involves interrupting the reload animation in order to shoot faster.

**How To Do It:** As you reload your weapon (popping/ejecting the thermal clip) watch for the number of bullets currently in your HUD change then tap **SPACE**. Your character will then go from a reload state to the regular state (ready to fire).

This technique is used by almost all shooters that can cut down half the time of reload. Reload cancelling works for most weapons with long reloads such as:

* Heavy assault rifles (Renevant, Falcon, Saber, etc.)
* Heavy shotguns (Claymore, etc.)
* Bolt Action Snipers (Mantis, Widow, etc.)

The reload on heavy assault rifles requires the character to insert a thermal clip under the rifle then hit the bolt-stop on the side. The bullet count changes once the thermal clip is inserted into the rifle, a reload cancel will prevent the character from hitting the rifle and cut reload time in half.

Heavy shotguns work very similarly to heavy assault rifles; your character will insert a thermal clip into the shotgun then pump it. A reload cancel stops the pump action and lets you shoot faster. This can greatly increase the fire rate of these shotguns.

Sniper rifles greatly benefit from reload cancelling. The pull-bolt snipers require your character to insert a thermal clip and pull on the bolt to chamber the round. However a reload cancel will let you shoot as soon as you insert a thermal clip into the sniper. This can almost double the rate of fire of the Widow.

How you use these techniques is up to you. 

**NOTE:**  
In pc ~~gaming master race~~ space is the default input for action/sprint/cover/everything. So just use the correct button for the consoles.

You can't be moving or behind cover while you reload cancel; this will result in you leaving cover, sprinting or doing a ~~barrel~~ roll.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,Alliance,True,t3_ri5ix,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/ri5ix/pro_tip_how_to_reload_cancel_reload_faster/,

With most in our ranks blindly charge into a group of unknown enemies at the start of a wave, leaving your squadmates to hack, defuse an objective, without your help as you lay there dying.

But vanguards do have a place in Silver and Gold. Primarily for 1 purpose. Crowd Control. This does not mean charge/nova all around the map where enemies spawn. It means keeping your team safe from short range threats, geth hunters, husks, guardians, even Brutes. 

Carry a single shotgun and support your team. A geth hunter sneaking into your firebase? charge, shotgun to the face, charge again. Threat neutralized. Only Nova if you absolutely have to but remember this will shake everyone's screen. That headshot your infiltrator was lining up with their Widow. It's important they don't miss. 

Vanguards should have the most assists, and the least amount of points on the scoreboard. They should focus on allowing the team to do their jobs properly. Adepts can focus on biotic explosions, infiltrators can focus on headshots &amp; hacking, engineers can overload and energy drain at a distance without worrying about being overrun.

If you decide to charge into the shit. Be sure to plan your escape. Charge into an enemy, and charge away to a single straggling enemy for safety.  Only do this to buy your team time to take enemies down at range (brutes, atlas, geth prime, ravagers, banshees are tricky but if you flank them you can get their attention and not get insta-killed). The vanguard can be a mobile tank b/c of the ability to replenish barrier instantly. Don't ever nova coming out of a charge (unless you really know what you are doing, and not using it as a panic reaction) as this will likely get you killed.

Nova is best used when you run into a small cluster of unsuspecting enemies, deal massive damage and then charge away to safety.

I hope more vanguards will wise up. Just playing Vanguard has become a reason to kick on these levels. If RoboArcher shows up in your group as a vanguard, please don't kick me.

i came into MECoOP in march as a n00b of note. i thought the avenger was pretty awesome, i couldn't aim to save my life (literally), i stood still a lot (normally immediately prior to lying on the ground), i wondered why when i punched something i would die but when others punched something it would go flying off the map. players magically teleported across the map, pulled out giant hammers, went invisible, got shot without dying, and killed whole groups of monsters with a single shot! how did these players do these magical things?

well, since then i have discovered that vanguards can charge magically, that there are annoying things called krogan warlords, that there are super-stealthy infiltrators, not all classes are squishy, and most dramatically, the cobra missile (what does this thing do? WOW!!!). i discovered some new guns, learnt to run around a lot (being revived all the time is a little embarrassing!), punched a few people so hard they died. i still can't really aim, but at least i can save my life occasionally :)

i learnt to hate banshees. i learnt to hate phantoms even more. now i hate with the most passion those annoying little bombers. but i loved playing against dragoons, would break into a grin at the sight of a brute, and would bounce excitedly in my chair whenever i saw a nemesis. 

i am notoriously chatty on the mic, and have met some wonderful people (Blue_sienna, MPApr2012, Nar-Laien, Nate159WG, among many others) who thought i was worth helping along. good friends now, they all are. they carried me through many, many games. my first taste of platinum left me wide-eyed and in shock - my N7 17 character spent most of the game dying, being revived, apologising, taking a step, and dying again.

i spent a LOT of time watching mind-blowingly brilliant players from spectator mode, as they got me through yet another wave. i learnt a lot from watching them. they learnt a lot about me as i answered phone calls, forgetting my mic on.

i fell in love with the krysae (sadly i never saw it pre-nerf), the novaguard, and jade. i caught myself smiling every time i heard a krogan proclaim , ""they're dead!"". i loved it when people would actually chat to each other instead of mindlessly zoning in to their own private little universe. the discovery of this reddit opened up a whole new world of joy to me.

my notorious south african lag could not dampen my fun. i got used to being banshee-grabbed from the other side of the map, to mashing ""1"" ten times before the shield-recharging bliss of the biotic charge would kick in; i learnt to shoot despite my screen not being able to decide which of two rooms i was currently in, i ALWAYS was second to arrive to revive anyone (took me forever to get my 100 first aid medals). lag-free games were all the sweeter for it.

i also finished the single player campaign today and will now have to play 1 and 2. and 3 again.

so now, [here](http://social.bioware.com/n7hq/home/overview/?name=superjaseZA&amp;platform=pc) i am. a new player, who by means of unemployment had a little too much time on his hands. i have an ever-growing e-peen and a love for newbies. i have the harrier, can refrain from embarrassing myself too badly even on platinum, am only a few challenges from BotB, and i understand how to be a good team mate (i hope).

So you are now reading a post about the most grindy of all challenges: N7 Mastery. Promotions, XP, and strategy; this post has it all. Well, it least covers the most important parts of it. When a class reaches Level 20, you can reset it back to Level 1 by promoting it for single player War Assets and an additional 10 N7 levels. 

N7 Mastery requires that you promote your classes 60 times. This seems like a daunting task at first, but so does the ""200 
waves as X kit"" in the Aliens tab as well. The reality of N7 Mastery is that there's no easy way to get it without playing the 
game a lot. There's no easy nor cheesy way to get N7 Mastery without a lot of work behind it as it will take you to the limit to 
reach it in any reasonable time. Getting N7 Mastery implies a small bit of skill and/or a large amount of grinding effort.

Before we get started, I should make a point about fun. See, N7 Mastery can take a lot out of you and make you dread loading up 
ME3 again due to how much time and effort is needed (~210 hr, as estimated later). Don't go for N7 Mastery because it's there. 
Even if you want it to get the Best of the Best, know that this challenge may make you regret it. Not being at your best may make 
you frustrated when you have to carry others at such a low level. On the other hand, constant promotion will allow you to try a 
variety of builds without using respec cards. In addition, the constant challenge may make the game more fun. The point is, don't 
burn out because of this challenge.

**Levelling System and XP Cards**

*XP Rewards*

Here's a relevant BSN thread regarding how XP is gained (social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15679903). It discusses how 
points are allocated based on how it is killed and who killed it. The most important thing I want to emphasize to grasp from this 
post is the point modifiers based on difficulty.

1.0x for Bronze

1.2x for Silver

1.6x for Gold

2.0x for Platinum

Given these modifiers, I judge Gold (given sufficient skill) to be the best difficulty to gain the maximum XP in the shortest 
amount of time. However, this assumes that you are quite the skilled player that can easily handle Gold carrying and Platinum play 
in a pinch. If you don't think you're skilled enough, Silver is also an adequate difficulty level.

*Levels 1 to 20*

Here's an informative post on BSN regarding how much XP it takes to reach the next level (social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/12430376#12432326). Note how the halfway point for XP is at level 17. Here are some interesting observations that I have made when leveling up regarding point distribution and suggestions to distribution.

* L. 1 (2 points; one pt. to cooldown skill, one pt. to non-cooldown is ideal)

* L. 4 (11 points;  4 ranks + one point)

* L. 8 (24 points;  can max out one skill with 3 pt. to spare)
 
* L.13 (45 points; can max out two skills with 3 pt. to spare)

* L.17 (63 points; can max out three skills, half-way point XP-wise)

*XP per game (rough estimates based on empirical evidence)*

Bronze (~100k XP)

Silver (200k to 300K XP)

Gold (300k XP to 500k XP, avg. 380k XP) 

Platinum (400k to 600k XP, ~450k XP with both specified)

Assuming each Gold game takes 30 minutes (factors initial loading, store being slow, waiting for players to join lobby, etc.) and 
an avg. XP/game of 380k, it takes 7(6.57 to be exact) games to promote a class. Assuming those two assumptions hold, it takes 
roughly 3.5 hr to promote a class. At 60 promotions, this takes roughly 210 hr of gameplay to gain N7 Mastery. Consider combining 
with challenges under the Aliens tab (200 waves as Y kit) to prevent boredom. You can churn out roughly 420 waves if you 
constantly play new kits during your time with N7 Mastery.

*XP Cards*

XP cards can save some time. Basic cards (in Recruit and Veteran Packs) roughly split half and half between 62500 XP and 12500 XP 
(Recruit only) cards. Do note that once all the Common weapons and mods are maxed out Recruit packs guarantee a character card with each purchase. Packs with Rare items (SPs, PSPs, RPs, APs) give out 250k XP cards. They don't guarantee one and unless you are missing cards, I advise against it as those characters take the Uncommon slot and are not guaranteed to drop when all the character cards are maxed (not 
even in Reserves Packs). 

Assuming a 50/50 split between 62500 XP and 12500 XP cards in Recruit Packs, each Recruit Pack gives (on average) 37500 XP. This 
saves approximately 3 minutes of game time assuming 380k XP/30 minute game. A 250k XP card saves approximately 20 minutes of game 
time assuming the 380k XP/30 minute game assumption is true. Given that Recruit Packs give 7.5 XP/Credit and Reserve Packs give 
2.52525 XP/Credit (assuming one character card in said pack), Recruit packs are the more cost efficient option when buying packs 
for XP. However, Reserve Packs are great if you are still unlocking kits to give more experience.So if you are using packs to get XP, I recommend buying Recruit Packs until you get your consumables back up to 255 after a game or session. This will take some time because the store likes being slow often, so I advise buying packs when you don't have enough time for a full game, typically in the time span of 5 to 10 minutes.

Look in the comments for Part 2 regarding leveling strategies.

This intro is supposed to bring up the general cross-faction types of enemies, with later guides going into the specifics of how to fight each faction. Let's-a go!


**ENEMY TYPES**

* **Troopers**: *Assault Troopers, Geth Troopers, Cannibals, Collector Trooper*. These are the baseline enemies, and usually the easiest to kill, as they lack any kind of shielding. They are only really dangerous in large numbers, or when backed up by other types of enemies. They also serve as grenadiers, with all but the Geth Trooper being able to throw grenades to flush you out of cover. Grenades can one-shot most classes if you're right on top of them, so pay attention when fighting these types of enemies and listen for the beep-beep-beep sound they make.

* **Captains**: *Centurions, Hunters, Marauders, Collector Captains*. These are units that are capable of supporting their faction with various abilities. Centurions can obscure your vision with clouds of smoke, letting their units shoot from relative safety. Marauders can buff Cannibals and Husks around them by putting armored plates on them that can block shots. Collector Captains can spawn power-blocking Seeker Swarms, while the possessed variety can spawn even more dangerous Seeker Plagues. Hunters are strange in that they don't buff their faction, but rather rely on their other troops to distract players while they sneak up cloaked right next to them and unload. Captain level units are also very adept at melee combat, with Marauders and Hunters being very dangerous up-close.

* **Suppressors**: *Nemeses, Turrets, Geth Rocket Troopers, Ravagers, Scions*. These are units that are designed to keep you pinned down in cover while close-range units close in and rip you to shreds. They are all long-range units, and are therefore best taken out by snipers or power classes. Alternatively, Vanguards are able to close in very fast, negating their long-range advantage quickly. Cerberus is notable for having two different kinds of Suppressors: Nemeses fill the long-range role, with very damaging sniper rifles that thankfully come with a very noticeable second-long charge-up. If you hear the telltale whine, get in cover, or get ready to lose your shields or health gate. Turrets, on the other hand, are incredibly damaging units that must first be placed by a Cerberus Engineer, which are much less dangerous on their own. For this reason, Engineers are often priority targets for snipers. When engaging a turret, never stay out of cover for more than two seconds, as they will seriously kill you that fast. Geth Rocket Troopers are long-range units that fire very damaging rockets that are a guaranteed stagger on anything that isn't a Krogan or a Destroyer. If they catch you out in the open and get a stagger, you'll likely get staggered by something else and die quickly. Rocket Troopers are a big reason that the Geth are so hated on MECoop. Ravagers are the Reaper Suppressors, which fire in very damaging three-round long-range volleys. They can hit you easily from the other side of the map, so be careful. Vanguards are very effective against Ravagers, since their close-range abilities are extremely limited. Alternatively, fire in the cooldown period between the three-round volleys. Scions are the Collector Supressors, and fire almost continuously, but not as rapidly as Ravagers. You usually have time to get off a quick shot between shots. They have no ability to control multiple targets, so a Scion that isn't firing at you is a very easy target. Try and shoot their sacs, as that will stagger them. They also have the ability to sync-kill, so be careful when engaging them up-close.

* **Cover Busters**: *Guardians, Dragoons, Phantoms, Geth Pyros, Geth Bombers, Brutes, Husks, Abominations, Possessed Scions*. Cover Busters are enemies that generally have very good close-range damage, and punish you for staying in cover. Some, like Dragoons, Bombers, Husks, and Abominations, are able to close in very fast and knock you out of cover, leaving you open for the rest of the faction to tear up. Others, like Phantoms, Brutes, Pyros, and Possessed Scions, punish you for not moving around by outputting extreme damage and staggers when you stay still in cover. When fighting cover busters, you'll generally want to take them out before they can close in, and if they do close in, get the hell out of cover. Possessed Scions are strange because they are the possessed form of a Suppressor, and retain their Suppressing abilities, while also getting to knock you back out of cover with cluster grenades. The fact that they have a combo Suppressor/Cover Buster should start to give you an idea of what makes the Collectors so feared.

* **Big Bosses**: *Atlas, Geth Prime, Banshee, Praetorian*. These are the biggest and baddest enemies on a faction, with widely varying powers. They all have an insane amount of health, and all have both some kind of shielding and armoring. Atlases and Primes are both psuedo-Suppressors, with great long-range capabilities and staggers. Atlases can pop smoke like Centurions, and have the ability to fire homing rockets like Geth Rocket Troopers. Primes are not unlike Ravagers, firing long range, high-force shots from across the map, and spawning combat drones that also stagger, and very damaging turrets. Banshees are widely feared, and rightly so, for their ability to very quickly close in and use their extremely fast sync kills to weed your team down. They can also throw warp balls that will damage you over time, and become temporarily immune to tech or biotic explosions. Praetorians combine the worst of both worlds, with the ability to fire highly damaging eye beams from long range, and close range chain staggering melee attacks that usually end in a sync kill. These types of enemies require focused effort by the team to take them down, and serve as tanks of a sort for their faction.

* **Sync Killers**: *Phantoms, Banshees, Praetorians; Atlases, Brutes, Scions*. These enemies are notable for being able to perform short-range instant kills known as sync-kills, that will automatically kill their victim-- in other words, you can't revive them until the wave is over. The first three units sync kill much more often that the last three, but all should be treated with care, and ideally at long range. The sync kill animation can be broken by staggering the enemy, which involves either a force threshold or a damage threshold. However, this stagger must come before a certain point in the animation. This point is usually rather intuitive, such as Banshees shoving their hand through you or Praetorians chomping down on your spine. Banshees can be broken by a damage threshold, by either stripping their barriers or shredding half of their armor bar.

1356034682.0,34,self.MECoOp,156nuv,Weapons Tier List: SMGs,41,7,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/156nuv/weapons_tier_list_smgs/,"To promote and foster some discussion as well as maybe push an idea I PMd RepShred (I'm still waiting for that to get off the ground &gt;.&gt;), I thought I'd make a weapons tier list.

The idea here is to rate each weapon and how they stack up to each other and against other weapons in the game. I'll start off with SMGs since there aren't too many of them and I've used them all quite a bit.

I feel like I have a decent knowlege of the game and ok mechanical skill (I can solo gold up to 6-7ish fairly consistently) so I figured I could get the ball rolling for each set of dicussions with my personal evaluations of each gun.

However, I fully acknowledge that I'm not nearly as intelligent or skilled as many of the players on this subreddit, thus I encourage open feedback towards my ratings, justifications and process. At its core, I want this list to be developed by the community.

In regards to the weapon tiers themselves, they will be ranked based on four categories (not necessarily evenly weighted):

**Damage:** How much hurt does this gun put out under perfect circumstances?

**Usability:** Directly related to damage, how easy or practical is it for an average user to reach the theoretical max DPS? This accounts for things such as exposure time, handling of the gun, and overkill.

**Flexibility/Utility:** What classes can make good use of this gun? What sort of mods can be reasonably used on the gun to suit different situations or player playstyles? Does it have an unique effect that adds to the potency of the weapon?

Weapons will be judged as if they were at level X, though rarity may impact a weapon's placement, the justification being usability.

The tiers themselves will go from bronze to platinum. However, this is meant to be a thematic choice and has little bearing on which difficulty I think the gun should be used on - by all means, a bronze weapon *can* be used on platinum if the user if good enough. The tiers instead are meant to just be a classification system of how good a gun is overall in all facets. Additionally, the order of guns within a tier itself also reflect how good that gun is ie. the first gun in the platinum list is better than the 3 one might be, but all of them are better than guns in the gold tier and below.

Justifications for each gun will be provided in the comments along with some general usage tips. If you want to comment on a weapon's tier or discuss it in general, feel free to comment on the weapon post. Again, I don't claim to be an almighty authority on weapons and am open to any and all constructive discussion.

Main weapon comments and the top post will be updated as feedback and discussion opens up.

Now onto the list!

While cover blocks it and it fires slow, it hits hard, 3 shotting my Destroyer on a solo bronze run.  Theres also seeker swarms.  Small swarms about the size of a beachball, they kamikaze into you, and give you a dot and massive cooldown.  I see these being the bane of power based classes. The Praetorian has a new model, and the eye beam of death we remember.  Seems as tough, or tougher than a banshee.  They can start flying, and look really creepy scuttling about on the ground.  Fortunately, they dont seem to do the stomp that restored their barrier in ME2.

I'm open to the idea of the class being an alien, so let's throw some ideas around! :)

Hey guys,
I think BioWare's done a pretty good job of expanding our options for taking the fight to Multiplayer, but there's one thing I feel they still haven't quite nailed down, and that's the Sentinel. In Mass Effect 1, the Sentinel was *the* definitive jack-of-all-trades class, with some nice support abilities. The jack-of-all-trades element is still there in Mass Effect 3, but none of the Sentinels really feel like support characters to me. So I sat down and thought of ways to both bring a new support character to the game while providing a unique gameplay experience we haven't seen yet.

After a couple of hours of brainstorming, I have that concept: The Adamant. Patent pending.

Here's the overall concept for the Adamant:  The class uses both Biotic and Tech abilities, for offense and defense, respectively - but one at a time. This is controlled by the class's main ability, Twin Disciplines. This is a toggled skill that switches the Adamant between Biotic and Tech modes. Each of these modes also comes with offensive and defensive bonuses, respectively, as outlined below. There are also two skills which have dual functionalities depending on which mode the Adamant is in: Salvo, which acts like a damage / force missile in Biotic mode and a shield restoring projectile in Tech mode, and Force Field, which causes damage over time and sets enemies up for biotic explosions in Biotic mode, and repels enemies when coming into contact with it in Tech mode. Each of these skills' trees allow for a wide variety of customization. There's also the mandatory Passive and Fitness skills.

In a nutshell, the Adamant can become an offensive machine or a support specialist on the fly, whenever the situation demands it.

For full details, check out my full outline below, and please provide feedback. I mainly just did this for fun, but if you guys think it's a really good idea, maybe we can push it to BioWare and see it in a future DLC pack! 

Note that all values and percentages below are estimates; I didn't do much calculation on them, just extrapolated them based on other skills with similar effects. Yes, it's probably very OP in its current state. Without testing, it's going to be. :P

Adamant

&lt;Race&gt; Sentinel

&lt;Insert racial description here&gt;

The Adamant combines the destructive power of Biotics with
the support and utility of Tech abilities. Though they split their training between both
disciplines and are prepared for any situation, they focus on just one of these
at any given moment, switching from a destructive whirlwind to a bastion of
defense whenever the situation demands it.

Combat Roll (Cross your fingers!)

Dual Slash (Similar to Sentinel melee, with one biotic blade
and one electric blade)

Salvo

Force Field

N7 Shadow:
The Electric Blade move is the tech equivalent of the N7 Vanguard's Biotic Blade move, same animation and pretty much the same properties.

Shadow Strike is a cool move.  Very similar to Biotic Charge.  You can only do it during Cloak.  When it activates, you invisibly charge toward the highlighted enemy and appear behind them to execute a high damage strike.  Does massive damage.

The Shadow's sword also seems to inherit properties of whatever ammo powers you equip.  Fitness is renamed to Sword Mastery, but has pretty much the same skill tree as drell, but with increased sword damage on armor vs shields for he last upgrade.

And minor detail, she does a different acrobatic flip over cover/barriers.

N7 Paladin:
The Tech Shield is COMPLETELY IMPENETRABLE.  Only downside is that you're completely immobile while using it though.  No shooting or power spamming.  Tapping melee results in a shield bash, holding it down creates the defensive stance.  You can exit by rolling in different directions or bashing an enemy in front of you.  Hacking circles should be A LOT easier now.  Spartan Phalanx formation, anyone?

PLATINUM PAYOUT:
The assumption that it's 140,000 is about right. 

CONTENT RARITY:
The developer I talked to didn't give a concrete answer to this.  He said that they are considering doing it the same way they did last dlc, with two weapons of gold rarity and and one of N7 rarity.  Character card rarity unknown.  He said that the new items will be tweaked to be easier to unlock once released.

*******************************
Played vanguard and adept with new shotgun and pistol.

Vanguard new abilities are both long range.  First is a phantom like canon shot from the palm that uses barrier.  The other one is like Shockwave with a sword swipe animation.  Seems to take a bunch of frames to execute.

Adept annihilation wave is close combat ability, had range of similar to tech burst.  First activation primes, second detonates.  Quick cool down, able to spec to increase movement speed.  Dark channel is good, like single player.  Think you have to recast for multiple explosions.

Apostle pistol is kinda shit, but didn't have time to use it enough so who knowa how good it could be.  No quick fire, charge weapon.  Once charged, projectiles bounce off walls like falcon, but no aoe.

Shot gun is automatic, decent fire rate.  Got good kills with vanguard charge and unload in platinum.  Spread is super wide though, wider than Claymore.  Didn't try it with choke.

I thought I would compile a very short and brief guide for those who would like a little bit more of a challenge.

*But salsa, I can't solo gold as it is! Let alone do it with marshmallow guns!*

Well friend, look no further than your old pal InterwebNinja and his buddy mrcle123. Together, they have written out the second new testament in order to give you all help and advice in mastering the Gold difficulty (And then soloing it). 

Here is InterwebNinjas [Pushing into Gold post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16zcwq/me_coop_college_501_making_the_jump_to_gold/).

And here is mrcle123s [How to solo](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/17chzb/me_coop_college_503_how_to_solo/) post. 

And my post noting some little tips when [Soloing on console](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/17i2jw/how_to_solo_on_console/).

So now you have your reading, have fun reading all that. It will take you up until the next eon to finish, so get comfortable. 

Now you are done with your reading, now for some visual learning!

[Mrcle123](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCit0rk2PNe_6TR-dXq-FGcQ) and [AaronEh](https://www.youtube.com/user/georgeaaustin/videos) both have videos that are excellent resources to refer to. I actually have based a lot of my own solo gameplay on Mrcle123s style of play and adapted it to my own. I have watched more videos of his than I would like to admit.

So now you can spend hours and hours practicing. Yes, soloing is no easy feat. I have succeeded at maybe 15 gold solos and failed over 50 easily.

Learning from your mistakes will be invaluable at learning your own style of success. Watch your own gameplay back if you are able to just to see what went wrong. 

So you can now solo. Now try it with the shittiest weapons in the game. Looking at you Viper/Shuriken/Incisor/GPR. You are literally going to need the patience of a Mongolian monk ninja. Or something. Because this solo will take you twice as long as it normally would. Ive completed solos with the Falcon (Which I actually think is amazing, but many disagree), Krysae, Tempest and Mantis. None of those weapons are close to being top tier. But you can make them reasonably good via a winfiltrator, soldier or engineer (In the case of high capacity tickle guns.)

Now we have covered patience, you need to be prepared to fail. One mistake and you are done for. Enemies just wont die fast enough to be able to safely take them out at range, so you will find yourself running away a lot more. Thats okay. Even the best of us run away like little Nemesis when a brute gets his 'charge of forever' on. 

Did I mention patience? Yeah you will need that. 

**Don't be afraid to just quit**. 

You will fail, you will get mad and you will play even worse. Quitting for half an hour or so, or even just bashing a PUG on bronze will ease you up a bit.

I have now failed 3/3 of my GPR solo attempts. [The most recent, I played magnificently throughout. I barely dropped my shields, not used any consumables outside of objective waves and was well on course to 10 waves survived. I won't tell you what happens, but there is a TLDR on the video for those who want to just skip ahead.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raDlpqU7-oc&amp;feature=c4-overview&amp;list=UUYfe_F1Q1MEcbUCn8pC_mFQ). I do however recommend watching through the game. I have cut it down to the last 2 waves so you don't have to be bored for the first 7. It was very systematic and generally boring to watch IMO. The last 2 waves I included because I think it perfectly displays that one mistake can cost you the match, which also displaying some key choices that I made, which kept me alive (I.e predicting oncoming brutes and warp balls as to dodge them most effectively, using soft cover to maximum advantage and just plain simple running away like a bitch.)

As always, feedback is appreciated and feel free to add me on origin if you would like some 'extra tuition'. 

Thanks for your time,

Salsa

**Build** [**N**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Vanguard/KroganBattlemaster/PAPNR/ReegarCarbine10AM5AO5//ShotgunRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator4/ArmoredCompartments5/) - [**K**](http://kalence.drupalgardens.com/me3-builder#65!3004525!!24F533!E.EAG)

*Debatable evolutions:*

* **Barrier rank 5**

I'm a big fan of shield-recharge on any class, so I go with that. Power damage isn't very useful because you are already over 1000N and 1500N is impossible to reach even if you take all power damage bonuses.

* **Krogan BM rank 4**

I go with damage&amp;capactiy. It gives me 0.38s faster cooldown. To be honest I have absolutely no idea if that is worth it or not. Just take whatever you want here. 

* **Rage rank 5**

I mostly play this class on platinum where melee is usually not very helpful, so I go with shield-recharge. If you play mostly gold or lower, martial artist can be nice to have. Little more detail about melee and shield regen is below.

Weapons
-

There is only one. Reegar. 

If you really don't want to use the reegar, use the piranha, hurricane or talon. (But seriously, use the reegar). 

They typical *ammo* choice is incendiary of course, but warp and armor-piercing work very well too. 

For *armor equipment*, I personally feel like I don't need cyclonic modulators with this class, even on platinum, so I go with adrenaline mods instead. This allows you move back out of melee range after charging much more easily. 

Another option is shield power cells, as they will lead to basically instant shield-recharge. 

For *gear* I usually go with stronghold pack on this class for the delicious shield recharge. But even outside of solos I'm still a fan of armored compartments on this class. The extra ammo is nice to have, and 8 missiles are just awesome.

Gameplay
---

**Videos**

I've got a [gold (18:24)](http://youtu.be/pq5HWXtjlnE) and a [platinum (40:42)](http://youtu.be/uqDTqj08TMI) video. 

Both of them are also my entries in the gold and platinum solo challenges of the mecoop tournament. So if anyone wanted to see the build for that, here it is. 

These videos show very well just how ridiculous the krogan vanguard is. The gold video shows his incredible tankiness. I'm not even using a cyclonic modulator and I still only die once, and that was because of the hazard swarm. 

The platinum video shows the general power of this class. The incredible efficiency at taking out phantoms and dragoons is what makes a quick cerberus solo possible. 

Just for comparison sake, the gold solo is 7 minutes faster than my best gold solo with another class. The platinum is over 15 minutes faster than my second best platinum solo.

Tips, tricks and loose ends
-

**About melee**

Using melee for damage is pointless in my opinion. If you had just kept shooting your reegar instead you would have done 3x more damage. 

The melee does have some uses though. 

My gameplay in the solos isn't quite indicative of this, but I do like to use the heavy melee to knock phantoms around. In solos I feel that is too risky though, that's why I don't use it in the videos. 

If you heavy melee right after charging, you can stack the damage reduction of charge, barrier and the heavy melee to become almost invincible for a short while (if you happen to have rage up, you should actually be invincible). This can be useful when you accidentally charge into something you shouldn't have. 

**About rage**

If you can get rage up it's always nice (unless you are on hazard white), but I have trouble doing it consistently even with a more melee specced kroguard. 

On waves that have husks, definitely use them to get rage up, but on waves that don't have husks or basic troopers my humble advice is to not bother. 

You'll probably spend so much time trying to keep your rage going that you would have been better of if you had just blasted the enemies with the reegar. 

**About charge**

In my opinion there are four reasons to charge: 

* To refill shields when there is no quick way to get into cover
* To move around the map and close gaps to enemies quicker
* To stagger enemies (primarily phantoms)
* To get the 25% weapon damage bonus against bosses

If none of these reasons apply, then in my opinion you shouldn't charge. Treat charge as something you want to use as little as possible, because damage output wise, it's a waste of time.

What also ties into this approach is my love for shield regeneration on this class. It allows me to use charge less, which means I can spent more time blasting stuff with the reegar. 

---

**Conclusion**

I hadn't played this kit for quite a while when I broke him out for the solo challenges in the tournament. I had honestly forgotten just how powerful this class is. 

For gold games I use a much more melee heavy build, because there is just no point in using this build on gold (for me). 

On platinum, in my opinion the shaman is just flat out better (hint: shaman guide incoming soon). 

So this build will probably go into retirement again for me, but I still wanted to share one of the absolute best builds in the game. 

If you want to break into platinum for the first time, or want to try your first gold solo, this is a great build to do it with.

Sure they aren't usually subtle nor sneaky, but they don't need to. Krogans attack like a battle bus loaded for bear and they make their presence know on the battlefield.

**Racial Passives and Traits**

Krogan get two great racial passives. Krogan Berserker is alright for power damage and weapon damage, but it augments the Krogan's high weapon weight capacity. At Rank 6 there is a 30% shotgun weight capacity bonus, which allows for plenty of heavy shotguns to feel like feathers. 

Krogan also get a great Fitness passive called Rage. When Rage is taken, it allows for the Krogan to entire Rage Mode by [ragdolling and killing](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/15r31k/the_rage_virus_krogan_rage_bug/) three (or two with Rank 6 Pure Rage) enemies with melee in thirty seconds. In Rage Mode, peripheral vision is reduced but in return the Krogan gains improved damage reduction and melee damage for the duration. The Krogan heavy melee also has a lot of force behind it, allowing it to stagger bosses with sufficient upgrades. Although this is powerful, it is mitigated a little by the Krogan's inability to dodge.

**Krogan Shaman Adept**

A tanky Adept, the Shaman acts like an a blend of Human Sentinel (with an active defensive battle ability and similar play-style) and Human Adept (with Shockwave as a strong BE ability). With *Barrier, Warp, and Shockwave*, the Shaman is an excellent Adept that acts as a solid tank that every Biotic team could use.

* Barrier acts like Tech Armor. Activating it gives damage reduction, cooldown penalty, and a stat boost at Rank 5. Detonating it is like Tech Armor, but it can lift an enemy down to Health only in addition to dealing damage.

* Warp is a solid power and should never be neglected. Decent damage, DoT effect, dual primer/detonator effect, and debuffing ability all help Warp's case as an excellent power. Warp can easily be snuck in after a heavy melee on a troublesome enemy, like a Phantom.

* Shockwave is also a power Biotic attack that can go through walls with a high BE modifier of 65% to hit multiple enemies. Although it has a limited range and wobbles the screen during use, I recommend investing into this power as it is quite useful in its own right. Like Warp, Shockwave can be snuck in after a heavy melee.

With both solid powers and tanking ability, the Krogan Shaman is a welcome addition to any squad. It does its best work to Biotic teammates, but even by himself he is fearsome.

**Krogan Soldier**

Like all Krogan, he is another tank. He can be defined in two ways. The first is with *Fortification*, where he is able to send melee damage through the roof (at [5302.5 damage](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/Krogan/FAAAK/GPSG10BG5AA1//StrengthEnhancer3//HydraulicJoints5/)). The second is through *Carnage and Inferno Grenades*, where he is a warrior loaded for bear with Fire Explosions.

* Fortification is an active power that grants damage reduction when active and a stat boost at Rank 5. When purged, it provides a melee damage buff for the next 30 seconds. Useful for any Krogan Soldier who wishes to attack with melee or tank harder with damage reduction.

* Carnage is a nice power. It basically acts likes Incinerate, with more damage upfront with less DoT and the ability to knock down enemies at Rank 5. It can both detonate and prime for Fire Explosions, making it useful with any team that is capable with working for Fire Explosions.

* Inferno Grenades are thrown at a low arc, but make up that shortcoming with a strong DoT element. While it can only prime for Fire Explosions, the DoT element is unusually strong and can be evolved to affect a large groups of enemies. 

So the Krogan Soldier can be either a melee tank or a Fire Exploding warrior. This is not for the faint of heart and great care should be taken when using the Krogan Soldier in a squad.

**Krogan Sentinel**

Sentinels are known for tanking, and the Krogan are the race of tanks. Put two and two together and you have something that will withstand bosses (*Tech Armor*), destroy bosses (*Incinerate*), and clear loads of minions in a jiffy (*Lift Grenades*).

* Tech Armor will increase damage resistance with a stat boost at Rank 5, but cut into power cooldown in the process. If the Krogan Sentinel is in close range danger, it can be detonated with extreme force so he can live another day. An excellent power for all Krogan Sentinels to take.

* Incinerate has its uses in terms of strong Armor damage, DoT element, and ability to panic organic Health. Incinerate can detonate Tech Explosions and prime for Fire Explosions, turning it from an alright to great power on the Krogan Sentinel.

* Lift Grenades are extraordinarily powerful and have a great radius as well. They can even lift an enemy with Health into the air after detonating. Unfortunately, Lift Grenades only detonate Power Combos after the target dies (which is redundant given the raw power the grenade possesses). This makes Lift Grenades terrible for detonating Power Combos and should never be counted on to do so. Still, it hits so hard that it's hard to ignore them on any build that has them.

This kit is one of the tank of tanks. In between high health, high damage reduction ability, and powerful attacks, the Krogan Sentinel can go to any place with any enemy and be useful.

**Krogan Vanguard**

Vanguards are excellent at tanking enemy fire and the Krogan Vanguard is THE king of tanking. With *Biotic Charge and
Barrier*, he is nearly impossible to kill. If he needs to attack from range, *Carnage* does an admirable job at doing so.

* Biotic Charge for the Krogan hits harder than most Vanguards' Charges. Combine with the fact it can regen 100% of the Krogan Vanguard's Barriers (Rank 6), it makes the Krogan Vanguard nearly unstoppable outside of sync kills. Biotic Charge kills for the Kroguard count towards Rage for some reason, so use that to your advantage.

* As seen with the Krogan Shaman, Barriers provides a nice defensive measure for any user. It allows the Krogan Vanguard to gain even higher defenses for a slightly longer cooldown. A must have for any Charging Kroguard.

* Carnage does not see that much use on the Kroguard, but it does provide for a nice option to attack from range to avoid sync kills. Usually overlooked, but it's a nice option to fall back on.

Kroguards are great for lone wolf players, but they can work well for any team needing a close range tank. For an in-depth look at the Kroguard, I suggest looking into the [Murdertrain](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/s73o9/all_aboard_the_murdertrain_or_how_to_krogan/). bigbossodin goes into great detail regarding every aspect of the Kroguard and it's something I recommend any player to look into.

**Conclusion**

The Krogan really follow the rule of work hard and party hard. They are literally tanks of feet and should never be dismissed as weak in a lobby. While they do require some skill to use, they have a high skill ceiling and the most intelligent of players will be able to exploit this. It just starts out rather simple: ""Fighting is easy, just kill the person coming for you"". With more knowledge on how the enemy fights and their own limitations, Krogan are nearly unstoppable on the field of battle. It's no wonder they fought off the Rachni and almost conquered the entire galaxy right afterwords.

Once you can handle Gold, given a 'gear check' you can do Plat. Plat is very much souped up later levels of Gold through every wave. Once you learn how to deal with each boss toe to toe applying these skills to mitigate damage to teammates becomes your job. Any Plat viable class should be able to deal with things like Hunters very easily, or be able to kite a Banshee or kill a Phantom quickly. Basically, once you can't handle your spot call a friend over. If you consistently fail to hold your choke, you should probably go back to Gold/Silver or tune your class/build.

Once you learn about the way classes synergise and which weapons/skills are good Platinum becomes easy. All those things you've learnt about right hand advantage and class synergy are what will drive you into Platinum. The niggles of this game such as the spawns, the way enemies act and things like you can't be sync killed on a ramp allow you to 'exploit' the game.

**Tips**

**Objective Waves:**

Courier Mission - This is usually relatively easy. A fast (Drell, Fury, Adrenaline gear) class or a tank class ideally should grab it and just tear arse for the extraction. If the rest of the team can draw the spawn away and just deal with them it leaves the courier clear to get the objective sorted out fast. If the way forward to the extraction is laced with enemies, go as a team and steamroll your way through. You can 'pulse' dodge to alternately drop the package and dodge forward to increase carry speed but this really is not necessary and takes a bit of practice. 

Four Hack objective - This can be one of the hardest. There are some spots where it's just difficult. Key things here are to send a class suited to deal with it if it's out of the way, but in general just get the fuck onto hacking it ASAP if it's close to you so you don't get overrun. If you're sending someone off to do it away from the position you're holding, let them go alone. This is especially important if you have a duration specced Infiltrator; let them do their thing. If you sit next to them you'll just draw enemies and fire towards them. Good classes to send are anything tanky and Infiltrators. If you're a Volus, hit cloak and Shield Boost then start the hack. This gives you extra immunity. If you're a Ghost, hit a Stim and Cloak before doing it; you have extra HP for some seconds and the cloak.

Escort - This is pretty simple and relatively easy. You can't do much other than stack on and work your way through. It's usually over quickly and since you're moving you won't get overrun like on a hack objective.

Hack objective - This can be the worst. Some maps just have awful hack objective placements (Rio, Reactor, London). Be prepared to use missiles. Wait if you can for the enemies to overrun you if that is the case (you're dancing with two Banshees and Pyros, Hunters, Dragoons etc are closing in) then missile them. You might need to use two per objective if you're in a bad spot.

Target Elimination - DING DING DING, you just hit the jackpot. This is easy. Treat it like a normal wave but just focus down that enemy. There is a weird niggle to this whereby if you missile an Atlas it usually ends up being an easy enemy like a Ravager for the next target. I don't know specifics of this but it's true. Missile them if you want, moreso if it's Wave 10.

**Enemies to deal with:**

 If there is an agile sync killer; deal with it. Phantoms or Banshees in your camping spot means everyone should kill the and quick. With a full team on it they shouldn't be alive very long. They can't sync kill you on stairs/slopes! Got two Banshees in your hair? Stick the tanked up Krogan/Destroyer/Volus/Ghost etc on the stairs to dance with them and tell your team to burn them down quick.

Primes are the bane of your life. They have insane damage, long range stagger, and once they close they can spawn Combat Drones and Geth Turrets on you. The Prime itself is pretty easily understood (DO NOT BE IN LINE OF SIGHT, if you take a blast MOVE). Once they spawn turrets behind you and a Combat Drone flanks you they are seriously unpredictable. Unless you're completely out of sight, deal with it FAST.

Stuff like Hunters can be dealt with quick but if allowed to can ruin your day if you allow them to flank you. Same with Pyros, Dragoons and such, but if you're putting out as much damage as you should be they'll be gone quick.

Atlases are slow moving and their damage is easily mitigated. Abusing right hand advantage means you should never get hit by a missile. Allowing yourself to get hit by a missile when surrounded by teammates affects you all since it's an AoE stagger and DoT.

**Team synergy and general tips**: 

Biotic teams are brilliant. There is no question. I'm sure most of you have played a biotic with a half decent other biotic and you've noticed how much easier things are. This said, Tech teams are *insane*. Exploited correctly, Flamer is easily the best power in the game. It puts out an absolutely insane amount of damage alone, and given a detonator it does even more. Soldiers stand alone as absolute powerhouses, although the ones with a detonator or Flamer (or similar) pay dividends.

Team synergy along with decent gear is most of the battle.

The next most important thing is strategy. I'm going to go through each map and provide a very simple strategy. If you fail, it's a problem of either not hitting a damage threshold (be it gear/weapons not meeting the standard) or incorrect strategy.

The utmost of importance is awareness and communication. See a Phantom closing in? Warn everyone. Call out targets. Want to burn down a problematic Atlas or Prime? Tell people. With the right firepower most bosses last less than ten seconds. Once that's over you get back to your job. If your posted choke is dead or empty, run over and help your team quell the oncoming horde. Usually the meat of a spawn will come one or two ways. If your way is empty, go to your teammates and make sure the meat of a spawn is dealt with fast. This frees you up to deal with problematic enemies such as Phantoms or Banshees which, with practice, become easy to kite or kill yourself.

**Map Strategies** - 

These aren't the be all and end all. There are great points in the comments which you should definitely read too. With a solid team camping isn't necessary but it's always nice to have somewhere to fall back to.

**Firebase Dagger:** 

You can sit in the circular observatory building. You have three chokes. The one that leads towards extraction, the ammo box just outside that room route and the long corridor (luckily, where most enemies will strike from). Hold this room. You're close to an ammo box (it's only one grenade sadly). Post a couple of guys on the long corridor and one each moving between the entrance to the meat of the map and one on the ammo box entrance. This is one of the harder Plat maps. A good team makes it pretty simple. The rest of the map is pretty open, so unless you're going out to clean up, stay close to the team and out of the open.

**Firebase Ghost:** 

I'll admit this is the map I find the hardest. With good teams it's a breeze, but I don't have a set stategy. The indoors room with an ammo box, towards the back of the map. is one of the better places to stay, although it is still pretty open. The ammo boxes on this map are generous enough with a couple of grenades. A tank character can draw problematic enemies like Banshees by sitting on the stairs (things can't sync kill you on stairs). The boxes are fair here, two grenades each.

**Firebase Giant:** 

Firebase Giant/Cerberus is possibly the easiest Platinum matchup. Once you spawn, sit there. The wall protects you from any long range shots and the meat of your enemy will come from your right, behind that big wall, relative from where you spawn. The meat of your firepower should be directed towards this, but the area towards the ladder can sometimes be the spawn and allow things like Phantoms up. An easy tactic here is Flamer and behind wall detonator (Phoenix/Electric Slash/Shockwave). This wrecks and will make things simpler for those watching out for the flanks. With a good setup (Techsplosions, Justicar bubble with a detonator) you can wreck the meat of the spawn and what comes from the side is easily dealt with. This isn't a great grenadier map (it's perfectly doable but the boxes are 1 grenade a piece). The mid map hack objective can be insane on this map; use missiles liberally.

**Firebase Glacier:** 

This is the map where you can get the fastest Plat runs (I think my record is sub-19 minutes). The place to camp is the room that's the lowest point; to your right from the extraction. The long staircase allows you an easy way to avoid sync kills from Banshees although the meat of your fighting should be holding that room and treating it as two chokes; from the extraction and from the elevated room. There is an ammo box on the stairs; IIRC it's two grenades. Some of the Hack4 objectives can be hard on this map; if you get one be liberal with missiles.

**Firebase Reactor:** 

Once you spawn, you'll want to run though the Reactor and sit around the back relative to extraction. There is an ammo box behind you and the meat of the enemies will come through the Reactor. Having one guy watch the left flank and to call targets when they are overwhelming/problematic is the way to go here. The ammo box is sparing with what at least feels like a long refresh and one grenade per recycle. Late wave hack objectives are really hard on this map; if you get one be liberal with missiles. Always select Hazard if you're doing this.
**
Firebase White:** 

Holding the high ground directly adjacent to the spawn or holding the back of the map are both good ideas here. The high ground and the far parts of the map (behind where you used to FBW/G/G camp) both provide an ammo box and easy cover abuse (right hand advantage) and a pair of chokes. The objectives here usually prove fairly simple.

**Firebase Condor:** 

Unless you're playing with friends or a team you've just blasted through multiple Plats in 20 mins with don't bother, it's pain olympics.

**Firebase Hydra:** 

There is the 'control room' adjacent to the extraction on this map. Camp there. There are two chokes, one with a long corridor and one with ample cover and ample retreat points. This is fairly simple. There are ammo boxes for those watching either choke; the one that is the run from the control room to extraction provides one grenade, the one outdoors from the control room overlooking the meat of the map has two.

**Firebase Goddess:** 

Once you spawn hang a right and right again to get into the room with all the computers in it. You have an ammo box in this room, and one just before to the doorway that leads into the meat of the map. Basically two chokes and a large staircase to allow you to laugh off Banshee and Phantom sync-kills. Both of these boxes provide two grenades making it a grenade spammers dream (I love Batarian 'Soldier' Slasher here [IGNORE LASH AND GET BIG GUNS]).

**Firebase Jade:** 

This is one I lack experience on and don't like that much. The long corridor left of your extraction as you spawn is probably the best place to hold. There is an ammo box and two chokes, but the two chokes are in line of sight with each other, so be careful. The box provides 3 grenades per cycle if I'm not wrong, so Ghosts/grenadiers rejoice. There are two chokes but each of them are corners the enemy come around with you down a corridor. This gives them advantage.

**Firebase London:** 

The side of the map adjacent from your extraction is where to camp. Ignore the high ground, it's false security. Hide behind the car; there is an ammo box to your left providing two (three?) grenades per cycle. The hack objectives here are some of the hardest in the whole game; you're just completely exposed. 

**Firebase Rio:**

 Welcome to grenade heaven. Hold the side of the map with the shipping containers. If you camp in the shipping containers you're pretty safe but Satan will come and rape you for queueing for Plat and then doing that. This is actual truth, Satan raped me and he will rape you too. Don't box camp on Rio. Grenade classes shine here, there are so many grenades and so much cover so you can grab them. The boxes provide cover from being grabbed, but played right there are two chokes proper you should watch. Getting hack objective in the middle of wave 10 is slaughter and you should happily use every consumable you have to get through that horror; be FUCKING liberal.

**Firebase Vancouver:** 

I haven't really realised great camping spots for this map. I don't find it hard on Plat with a good team, but it kind of feels like a wider Glacier.

Notes: Collector Plat is just harder than each other matchup. It's fine with a solid team, like anything, but other choices make things much simpler.

So you guys get to have a week of competition to put a banner (in this thread) that you want to see up top. After a week of pandemonium and banners, we will then have a vote on choosing which banner to put on top. Then the old banner goes into the depths of the Internet while the new banner gets slapped on.

A few guidelines:

&gt;    2000x150 max dimensions

&gt;No Mass Effect 3 CoOp logos included - the current one at the top of the page (and the reddit alien krogan) is a separate image to the banner that serves as the link back to the main page

1350289815.0,32,self.MECoOp,11i5ii,Why You Should Care For: The N7 Eagle,49,17,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11i5ii/why_you_should_care_for_the_n7_eagle/,"*Alternate Title: How I l Learned to Stop Whining and Love the Eagle.*

Like the Geth Pulse Rifle, the N7 Eagle is one of those weapons nearly everyone hates. Initially it did flat out suck, and as an N7 weapon it was a curse for those who got it. The other N7 weapons were extremely strong, but the Eagle was literally a piece of rubbish in comparison. Even by itself, the initial Eagle wasn't that great.

When I first tried it, I too hated it. As time progressed though, it got better and now has a niche to fill. The reasons this write-up did not happen sooner (last Tuesday was when I intended to write it) was because I busy with school and people didn't take kindly to the Geth Pulse Rifle being recommended with a second look. Now to examine the N7 Eagle in detail.

____________________________________________________

*Why is the N7 Eagle reviled?*

**I never asked for this**- Despite being a heavy pistol, it functions like an SMG. Fully automatic fire, moderate recoil, and somewhat low damage per shot (compared to other pistols) made it an odd one in the bunch of pistols. Few saw the need for such a pistol, especially when an SMG or Phalanx was present to satisfy their needs of a rapid fire weapon. 

**This gun flies right out of my hand**- The recoil on this gun, compared to every other pistol, is strong and will surprise many people who use it. 

**I demanded a specialist, not a generalist**- The blend of pistol and SMG made it power diluted. It was not as good against armored targets as a Carnifex yet it was also not good against fast moving targets as a Hurricane. This made the Eagle go into gun purgatory.

**I DEMAND SATISFACTION**- Compared to the Crusader, Valiant, and Hurricane (which had great uses), the Eagle was essentially the equivalent of getting coal for Christmas. Not only was the Eagle so-so, it meant that you could have gotten a better weapon. This made a lot of people angry.

There were some legitimate reasons why the Eagle deserves hate, but now with the myriad of buffs it has received there is a great niche it fills.

____________________________________________________
*And why should I give the N7 Eagle a second shot?*

**This is a gun? I can't feel it.**- A nice attribute this gun possesses is that it hardly weighs anything, useful to casters and power hungry classes. This attribute is magnified with the next point I will make.

**Jack of all trades, master of none, certainly better than a master of one**- The main strength of the Eagle is that it can fulfill many roles. In between its average stats of all the gun attributes and the variety of mods that can be attached to it, the Eagle can be modified to suit anyone's needs, be it a melee and AP weapon for Slayer, a damage and capacity heavy SMG for snipers, or even a scope and ULM for those casters who need the low weight and scope to accurately place their powers. The gun can literally be purposed to fit into every build in some capacity.

____________________________________________________
*Miscellaneous*

**The gun is more fun once you stop whining about it**- Once you get over the fact you didn't get a Crusader/Valiant/Hurricane, the Eagle's advantages start to shine. Just stop focusing on what you don't have and start focusing on what you do have. It makes the gun from **ANGRY PILE OF HATE** to ""Oh, this gun has its uses"". 

**It also is a great gun with friends**- Even if your friends still believe that the Eagle is total rubbish, try to killsteal with the gun. It is a sure testament of skill to killsteal with the Eagle, and it helps your gunplay improve as a result of it. 

____________________________________________________

And that is why you should give the N7 Eagle a second go. It's versatility is both its greatest strength and weakness. Slap it onto a power based class to get the best results out of the Eagle.

Now that you read this, you can comment on it down there in the comments. Just don't repeat the hate train that was the Geth Pulse Rifle, ok? At least state your reasoning for not liking the Eagle so I can understand why you loathe it so much.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,,True,t3_11i5ii,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11i5ii/why_you_should_care_for_the_n7_eagle/,
1349983405.0,36,self.MECoOp,11bozf,Tactics for taking on the Collectors,36,0,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11bozf/tactics_for_taking_on_the_collectors/,"So, no one's really figured out a rhythm for taking on the Collectors yet.  Let's share strategies.  Here's some things I've learned from my own experience and through the BSN forums.

**You can't camp the Collectors**

Best strategy so far seems to be to stay together, but be ready to scatter when grenades are dropped or a praetorian laser comes through.  For now, a conservative strategy of backing away from the spawns seems to be the best bet.

**Swarmers are high priority targets**

If you don't take out the swarms before they get to you, your power-using classes are hosed.

**Pop the sacks on the Scions**

Popping the Scions' sacks debuffs and staggers them.  They're mostly visible from behind but there is one on the left shoulder that you can target from in front of them.  Bring on the snipers!

**Stay away from Possessed Abominations**

In PUGs, you're gonna get some mook who does not understand that the Possessed Abominations will nuke everyone when they explode.  If you haven't figured out not to kill the Possessed Abominations when a friendly is standing near them, then you should feel bad. :)

Then again, sometimes it's funny as heck to have the team wiped in this fashion.  This leads me to my next comment...

**Medi-Gel Transmitter is a great crutch**

The Medi-Gel Transmitter is very helpful during these learning times.  In most of the PUGs I've played against Collectors, there are a lot of instances where multiple friendlies go down all at once.  While you're learning tactics, it's probably beneficial to forgo damage-buffing gear for the more supportive ones, if you have them.

**Praetorians have a soft spot in front, behind armor plates**

I haven't confirmed this myself, but on BSN it was mentioned that there are two chest plates on the front of the Praetorian that can be shot off.  Behind them you'll see the skulls that were so prevalent on the Praetorian model in Mass Effect 2.  Once the chest plates are shot off, the Praetorian is a little more squishy right there.

That's all I can think of right now.  Please add more and/or correct me on any of the above!  Oh, also, I haven't figured out or read what the Collector Web does yet, so if anyone can add that detail, that'd be spiffy.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,PC,True,t3_11bozf,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11bozf/tactics_for_taking_on_the_collectors/,

I've heard that Platinum can have multiple factions on the field at the same time, for instance.

However, I don't know the extent of these differences, and I'm sure I'm not alone (even among those who have played a few Platinum games).

So what I'm looking for here is a breakdown of the differences in 
- Wave budget
- Number of enemies on the field at a time
- Enemy damage
- Enemy health and/or damage reduction
- Enemy behavior (aggressiveness, etc)
- Enemy speed (mobility, reaction time, etc)

Subject: Assigned tasks for the four-man fireteam

Men, you've been assembled for one reason and one reason alone. It's not because you're each the best of your respective classes; it's because you show a level of cooperation that I have yet to see in my 30 years as an Alliance officer. The level of cohesion between you is commendable, and no doubt the reason you've already accomplished so much. This is the mission briefing for your next assignment. 

**Male Quarian Infiltrator** *""Team!""*

You're the team leader. Identify a target with Tactical Scan, increasing damage done to the target by 20% and signaling to your team that YOU WANT IT DEAD. Strip shields down with Arc Grenade, customized for shield/barrier damage. Bring whatever heavy weapon you want to destroy enemy armor. Cooldown isn't your top priority.

**Geth Infiltrator** *""Ready!""*

You are the designated scout. Be sure to utilize the Proximity Mine, which increases damage done to the target by 20%. After hitting the enemy leader, spam mines to keep lesser enemies from advancing. Couple it with whatever gun you like. I suggest the Falcon to help knock those troopers out of the way-- they're a problem below your pay grade.

**Asari Justicar** *""Fire!""*

When the enemies begin to pour in, you should already have your bubble set up. It should be customized to increase damage done in a large, warped radius. Your duty is to cast Reave on the afflicted target to cause very large detonations. You are also second-in-command, in charge if the fireteam leader has to make a stealth rescue mission for a downed scout.

**Turian Sentinel** *""Assist!""*

Overload should be utilized to remove enemy shielding. Once shields are down, primary duty is to keep Warp on the target. If the Justicar Bubble disappears, you need to keep setting up the explosions. Other than that, bring a powerful gun and keep firing. In addition, you should be the one gathering data for the ""retrieve"" objectives, given your higher durability.

By combining the exposing effect of scan, bubble, mine, and warp, the defenses of enemy commander units should be practically non-existent. The scout and fireteam leader should ensure that the target is properly identified and weakened, then focus on crowd suppression. I want to see fireworks, people. Make me proud.

Hackett out.

Unfortunately, this is all theoretical, since I don't have 3 friends to play with. If anybody can assemble these Planeteers and see if their powers combine, I would be very interested in the results. Any suggestions, comments, and critiques are welcome.

ME3 coop is the most fun I've had playing in a long time.

There's surprising depth in this game - but the game requires you to know a lot of things to play effectively. This is just one of the many things that frustrates me:

**People always try to shoot the floating / glowing enemy first**

This isn't optimal because he's going to be the detonator for the combo explosion 2 seconds later. This leads me to believe that most people actually don't know how biotic combos work. When I started, I didn't know. I had played the single player, but as a soldier.

Similarly, yesterday this one sniper consistently shot the yellow glowing Geth first, which was just mean since I was the Quarian Infiltrator hacking them.

I'm not hating on noobs, I was very nooby at first and made the same mistakes. Only after the redditor in me found this subreddit I started to realize what was going. Because this is not as simple a game as you'd expect, and due to random unlocks the aforementioned sniper might not even have the Quarian Infiltrator, and has no idea what hack does.

Anyway, the point is that this game has surprisingly complex interactions, and it's not easy to realize all that without a good source. In Europe nobody seems to use their mikes, so it's not helpful to tell people that way.

Any opinions on this, possible fixes how to spread the word?

No it’s not some well-constructed piece of technology fabricated by the best minds of the galaxy. It’s not the weapon that pumps out sustained amounts of DPS or keeps its enemies in a perpetual state of stun-lock. Instead it’s a violent, unforgiving, and vengeful weapon, it is: The Executioner pistol.
&gt;
&gt;This is not a weapon with a tactical purpose, but rather a personal one. There isn’t a mook that can stare down the barrel of The Executioner and later write home to their sweetheart about how they won the war. This gun has one goal and one goal only: cold blooded murder.
&gt;
&gt;The highlight of this weapon is its powerful single shot capacity. It dishes out incredible damage at the expense of any resemblance of fire rate or accuracy. This makes the weapon almost exclusively manageable at extremely close distances, or as the name indicates, execution range. Because of the close range nature of this weapon it’s an ideal fit for melee builds that don’t rely on laying down covering fire. The N7 Shadow and Slayer come to mind having little use for weapons outside of their melee and power boosting attachments. Other candidates include power users who might get a little to close to the frontline, such as the N7 Fury or Krogan Shaman. This is a weapon you intend to only shoot once or twice a round between cool downs.
&gt;
&gt;The Executioner seeks out a particularly overly confident enemy we all plan for in every loadout, the Guardian. The Executioner packs a special surprise for this shield wielding Cerberus prick: built in armor piercing ammunition. With The Executioner at your side you will drop whatever you’re doing, even leaving your team to bleed out and die in a nearly finished hack objective just to pop these little weasels heads off. You see, the Guardian is a slow and cocky enemy and will willingly allow a player to strut up against their shields, take careful aim, ask for spare change, and fire right through the pizza boxes they think will protect them from bullets. The first time you blow a Guardians face out the back of their heads you’ll never look at that cute little Blood Pack Skull on the side of this weapon the same again.
&gt;
&gt;And it doesn’t end there. This weapon will make you squeal with joy when you pop a one-off shot on an Atlas triggering it’s VI System to reevaluate itself as an overcooked Hot Pocket. The weapons weaknesses and nuances will make you appreciate every kill you earn with it. So put that pistol scope mod away and earn those bloody headshots. Just please, try to avoid getting on your mic and screaming to your teammates, “DID YOU SEE THAT? I JUST KILLED THAT DUDE!” Because they did, and they thought it was *awesome*.

I've seen quite a few builds that focus entirely on either biotic slash or tech combos with phase disruptor, but not much discussion on how to actually play it like the 22nd-century swordmaster it is, and certainly no actual detail on technique, other than a couple comments I've written in the past. So let's get to it.

[**THE BUILD**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Vanguard/NSlayer/RMAOK/Wraith10BG5AM5//StrengthEnhancer3/PowerAmplifierModule4/HydraulicJoints5/)

The theory behind slayer builds is basically Biotic Slash, Phase Disruptor, Melee: pick 2. To start off our slaying spree, let's go ahead and slay biotic slash. The reason you don't want biotic slash on a slayer is that it's completely counterintuitive to an action-focused vanguard build. When I play a vanguard, the first thing I think of isn't, ""All right, time to stand behind a wall and spam a button as I slowly chip away at enemies,"" it's, ""Motherfucker I am about to get **IN THERE.**"" People tout biotic slash as a highly useful power that can detonate multiple biotic explosions and has above-average base damage. You know what other powers do pretty much the exact same thing? Smash and shockwave. You know what classes with smash and shockwave don't have? A space sword and a palm cannon of death. Yeah. I don't understand why anyone would waste all the potential coolness of this class when they could fulfill the same functional role as a BS-specced slayer on like 4 other classes. Finally, let's move past number-crunching and look at it from an applied, in-game perspective. The frame data on biotic slash is abysmal. It has almost a second of startup before the power actually comes out where the slayer is a complete sitting duck to get shot, burnt, charged, staggered, etc. On gold, using biotic slash when the enemy has line of sight on you is a death wish. You know what they call a move that has a second of startup in a fighting game? ""The move that you never use unless you do it by accident."" If you want a slayer that plays like the most style-saturated, ultra-badass vanguard in the galaxy, biotic slash is not your ticket to ride.

So with my new graphics card I can handle recording 720p video during gameplay now. Since this is a class that pretty much entirely eliminates the RPG aspect of Mass Effect to focus on action-oriented gameplay (it's practically Devil May Cry at this point), it's almost essential to see it in action to really get a feel for what I'm talking about. [**Check out this round I played on Firebase Ghost and see how much I missed having Biotic Slash during it** (spoilers: the answer is ""not even a little"")](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8cX63zQ4Jc)

As the video hopefully demonstrates, the way charge, phase disruptor, and melee work with each other is flowing and seamless, a trifecta of powers that possibly have the highest synergy with each other in the entire game. The way it works is basically this: phase disruptor drains your barriers, biotic charge restores them, and melee combos provide extremely high damage reduction during biotic charge's cooldown. The damage reduction is so insane that the only thing that can really kill you if you're melee comboing after a charge is getting staggered or grab-killed. You'll notice in the video that I can charge turrets, combo them, and only lose about 1/4 of my shields to their sustained fire over the entire duration. Even with omni-blade equipped, the wraith keeps your weight bonus high enough so that your melee combo lasts longer than charge's cooldown, allowing you to charge again immediately after you lose the damage reduction. So really the simplest way to play this class is just to charge, mash melee, charge, mash melee, and repeat over and over until everything's dead. It's also the safest way to reliably stay alive (unless enemies with grab kills are involved), so it's a technique you should fall back on when surrounded by enemies and constantly taking fire, ""crunch time."" You'll notice in the video that even if I fuck up my charge and don't end up within melee range of an enemy, a lot of times I'll just melee combo anyway to get the damage reduction while I wait for my cooldown to be up. If you find yourself exposed and unable to charge but still with most of your shields left, do a melee combo to buy yourself some time and decrease your squishiness. The more advanced stuff that comes with time is knowing when you can get away with throwing phase disruptors and heavy melees in there, which I'll cover in more detail later.

Before going in-depth I want to take a second to discuss **keybinds,** which I think are an **extremely important** aspect of playing this class effectively while also having fun. The default setup of the melee key on F and phase disruptor on 2 is very far from ideal. I could barely go more than a single game with phase disruptor on 2 without feeling like I was giving myself carpal tunnel syndrome. The binds I use are **melee on my thumb mouse button and power slot 2 on my middle mouse button** and they work exceptionally well. Having the right binds that you feel comfortable with makes a world of difference while playing this class and the action feels a lot more natural and fun. I've never played on console so I can only guess at the keybinds there (melee on one of the face buttons and PD on a shoulder button?), but that seems like a workable setup, although you won't be able to rotate the camera with the right thumbstick during your melee combo so you can search for a new target to charge the instant it ends, which puts you at a slight disadvantage. Still very doable though.

Now that we've got that out of the way, let's move on to the real topic at hand: slaying with the slayer. First off, I'm going to go ahead and set the definition: **the only kills you get as a slayer that actually count as ""slaying"" are heavy melee kills.** ""Heavy melee?"" you say. ""That shit's useless. It leaves you almost as vulnerable as biotic slash does!"" And you're absolutely right. But the main difference between biotic slash and heavy melee? Heavy melee is as cool as the ninth level of Hell in Dante's Inferno. And let's be real here, the whole reason to play slayer at all is looking cool. You want substance over style, I've got a nice fembot with a reegar carbine sitting here on the class selection screen for you. But if you want to be a slayer that slays, you should be killing with heavy melee whenever you can get away with it. The tricky part is knowing when you can get away with it, and that's what I'm here to help with. Basically if you still have enemies firing at you and you go for a HM kill, you're almost certainly not surviving those vulnerable recovery frames. You need to kill all the enemies in the visible area around you, then slay the last one. The benefit you get from successfully slaying is not simply being able to go, ""wow, how fucking awesome am I?"" either. The martial artist perk sends you into hyper mode, increasing both the damage of your light melee combo as well as your phase disruptor shots. The downside of the move is that it's extremely risky. You'll notice in the video that almost all the times I die or come closest to dying, heavy melee is somehow involved. If you don't account for timing or the enemy being staggered, it will flat-out miss, and you can be killed or even sync-killed during the teleport animation as well. If you're just starting out playing the class, expect to miss, die, and generally look dumb a lot more than you saw in the video. The trick to make it not miss is after charging and softening them up with a phase disruptor or two, **WAIT** for a brief moment for them to start to recover from their stagger, **THEN** heavy melee. If you try to do it too quickly you won't teleport lock to them. With omni-blade V, hydraulic joints V and strength enhancer III, it does 2500 damage on its own and 3300 damage while your martial artist perks are activated, so the damage is pretty significant and easy to kill enemies with after hitting them with 1 or 2 palm cannons. Great for slaying bosses as well, as you can see in multiple instances in the video vs. atlases. Wait for them to get down to 1 or 2 bars of armor, then anime-slash the fuck out of them.

Next we'll cover **phase disruptor**, which ends up being just as big a part in the gameplay as your actual swordsmanship. It's a great way to weaken groups of enemies from range before charging them, perfect for getting aoe damage after a charge before going into a melee combo when the group of enemies is still staggered and can't yet fire at you, and will end up being your primary way of fighting bosses like brutes, banshees, scions, praetorians, and atlases that have the danger of sync-killing you. Any time you're dealing with these enemies, as well as more than one phantom at a time, the technique is to charge, teleport backwards out of grab range, spam phase disruptor until they take your shields out, then repeat until they're dead. It's 100% safe against enemies like brutes, scions, and atlases since they have to perform a melee attack before they can grab you. A lot of times your charge will bait out this melee attack. All you have to do is make sure *not* to charge them again after they do it until they start up a different attack; then you're safe to charge them again. It is *not* 100% safe against teleporting banshees. There is a very low chance that you will charge them and instantly be grabbed, although if you're spamming backwards teleport as you charge, 9 times out of 10 it won't happen and you'll get away with full shields to continue your phase-disruptive activities.

With **phantoms**, things get a little strange (yes, they get their own section). The preferred method for dealing with them is just to kill them with phase disruptor to remove all chances they'll be able to impale you, but if you're going 1v1 against them or have other enemies shooting at you from a distance, the charge &gt; phase disruptor &gt; light melee combo is almost completely safe as well. They follow the rule of having to hit you with a regular melee before they can sync-kill, and since Your PDs and charge will stagger them, you'll usually get them down to health before they even have a chance to swing at you, which forces them to go invisible and be unable to attack. The really nice thing about the light melee combo is that as long as they're ""targeted (highlighted by the red box)"" when you start mashing your melee key, it will stay locked onto them and keep hitting them automatically even when they cloak and start flipping around. This is demonstrated several times in the video; phantoms almost never survive the light melee combo. For 2 or more phantoms at once though, **DO NOT** attempt to melee combo. The one you're not slicing up will just hit you with her sword, which will stagger you, and then you're completely fucked. If a second phantom runs up to you while you're attacking the first, mash backwards teleport to cancel out of your melee combo and fall back on the charge &gt; phase disruptor cycle to deal with them until only one remains. Heavy melee vs. phantoms looks extremely cool and it's cathartic as hell to decapitate them, but it's also extremely risky. It got me killed in the video and it's not even guaranteed to slay them if they decide to flip and get damage reduction, which also happens at least once. In another game, I've actually had one manage to sync-kill me in the middle of teleporting at her (complete bullshit, but somehow it happened). I do not advise doing it unless you're 100% sure it will kill, which it's very hard to be.

The real beauty of this class is that it's extremely possible to go the **entire game without firing a single shot from your gun,** something which I'm not sure you can really say about any class other than novaguard. The only thing I need my wraith for is killing guardians, for which it's pefectly suited. Just charge them to cause them to reel back and knock their shield aside, line up with their head, and *pop*. One-and-done. Technically I guess you could use it for priming fire/cryo/tech explosions on bosses, but I don't even bother. The damage ammo explosions do is rather inconsequential, and I'd rather just be spamming phase disruptor at maximum speed and charging to get shields back rather than alternating between weapons fire and PD. If you have tech teammates playing with you it will detonate their combos anyway, which will be more powerful than ammo explosions.

I used to be afraid to play this class against anyone but geth because of sync kills, but now that phase disruptor is more powerful it can really work against all 4 enemy types. Geth and cerberus are where you'll be using your sword the most (watch out for the prime's combat drone vs. geth, the stagger on that thing will fuck you over. Always try to aim your charge at it.), whereas the more boss-heavy nature of reapers and collectors means that you'll spend more time using phase disruptor while dealing with brutes, banshees, scions, and praetorians, only using melee to deal with troopers and ravagers when no sync-killers are closing in on you. You've got to be real careful about doing melee combos against cannibals and marauders vs. reapers, as they keep you locked in place for a few seconds where you can have a brute charge you from the side or a banshee teleport up to you and sync-kill. Only melee combo when you know the bosses are far enough away that they won't be able to reach you before you finish.

One final thing: the amount of damage reduction your melee combo gives you can be deceptive about this class's survivability; without it, he is extremely squishy. **Like the annotation in my video says, there is a reason this class isn't called ""N7 Reviver"" or ""N7 Objective-Doer.""** Your primary job in games is not to revive teammates, it's not to carry packages, it's to **slay everything you see.** Trying to revive teammates or do objectives often will only result in you getting yourself killed. It's a much better idea and overall contribution to the team to try and kill everything in the area around the objective or downed teammate, allowing tankier characters or infiltrators to have an easier time reviving or carrying the package. This is true for most vanguards, but perhaps most relevant on this class.

I think that should about cover everything, I'll obviously be here to answer any additional questions you guys have. Personally I think the video does a lot more to sell the class than any length of text I could write on it. It's practically a whole new game and extremely different from pretty much any other class's playstyle, and once you get comfortable with controlling it potentially the most fun you can have with ME3.

1364270290.0,33,self.MECoOp,1b0t40,Buying ME3 as a multiplayer game,40,7,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1b0t40/buying_me3_as_a_multiplayer_game/,"I, like what I presume the majority of the community did too, originally bought ME3 solely for the singleplayer and only discovered later that the co-op is what I would end up dumping the majority of my time into. It was the most pleasant surprise I had last year in all of the games I purchased.

Now, while the multiplayer has now been announced that it will no longer be updated, on the other hand the game is only a mere $10!

I attempted to convince some of my friends to join me in ME Co-Op previously, but it was a very hard sell for them to join me in what was supposed to primarily be a single-player game when the game was at full price. 

However, I recently got 4 of my gaming buddies to buy the game as it's only $10 and we've been having a blast playing together. 3 out of 4 of these friends haven't even played any Mass Effect game in single player, and they still really enjoy the co-op despite being unfamiliar with the Mass Effect universe. They all agree that the game is well worth the $10 for the multiplayer alone. Now that the multiplayer is ""complete"", new players have a **lot** of characters and weapons to unlock, and they have been playing the game quite a bit and still have a lot to experience.

So, I've always been curious, how many of you in this subreddit got ME3 for the multiplayer alone? Additionally, although I probably already know the answer to this question, how many of you believe the game is worth the $10 (or $20 when it goes off sale) for the multiplayer alone?",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,PC,True,t3_1b0t40,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1b0t40/buying_me3_as_a_multiplayer_game/,
1361838444.0,33,self.MECoOp,198581,Crowdsourcing ME3 Store Drop Rates - Part Trois,39,6,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/198581/crowdsourcing_me3_store_drop_rates_part_trois/,"Hey folks - the new DLC is upon us and I'd like to collect some more data from folks that are willing to help out.  This time around, I think I've made it a little easier to participate (both on your end, and mine).  I've put together a spreadsheet [***HERE***](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApDZeTqKtMIydFR0RW1mNnBobUlJQWxvZFowdzFkdXc&amp;rm=full#gid=1) for everyone to be able to record their data.  Instructions for using this are covered below.

####USERS TAB

First of all, while this spreadsheet may look a little crowded, it isn't necessary for you to meticulously record all of your packs; you are welcome to determine your level of involvement.  If you just want to count your UR weapons, that's great.  What I need, though, is a disclosure of what you intend to keep track of.  There are two tabs - the first is 'Users'.  Here, record your reddit ID (no need to disclose platform unless you are playing more than one), and mark the state of your manifest.  This should be the state immediately before you buy your first pack.  Assuming you intend to start recording your purchases shortly after the DLC is released, you should no longer have a maxed UR / Rare weapon or character manifest.  In addition to recording that, the last column in the table is where you should note what you intend to track.  By no means feel obligated to track everything.  It does make spending more tedious.

Note, once you do max a portion of your manifest, *do not* update the state of your manifest on this tab.  This information needs to be recorded in the 'Drop Log' tab.

####DROP LOG TAB

The 'Drop Log' tab is where you can record your purchases.  You can either record your packs one by one, or you can record many at the same time.  I've seeded it with some data, so you can see examples of where I buy them one by one, or several at the same time.  It should be fairly self-explanatory.  No need to put zeros in the things you don't get - just fill out the quantities for the goods that you have chosen to track.  Note, I'm not putting consumables on here because those mechanics are well understood.  If you max your consumables and start getting equipment in those slots, don't include that equipment in this spreadsheet.

The rightmost column of this spreadsheet is where you should record whenever you max a portion of your manifest.  For instance, if you go on a big spending spree and max out your Rare characters on your 25th Reserve Pack, you need to note that in this column.  If you're recording your purchases one by one, just make a note like 'Rare Characters' in this column on the pack that maxed them out.  If you're doing a big dump of data in a single row, make a note like 'Rare Characters (25)'.  If you don't record this information, the drop rates are going to be understated for these goods.

Technically, you can 'unmax' a portion of your manifest, as well.  This will happen if you start recording data before the DLC (like I am) after the new DLC is released, or it can happen for 'Reset Powers'.  In particular, if you're keeping track of the 'Reset Powers', you'll have to keep meticulous track of when you max it out (i.e. get up to 3 of them), or when you unmax it (i.e. use one of them).  Just record this if you intend on tracking that good.

####WHAT TO BUY / TRACK

People have been asking what I'm interested in collecting, and honestly, I'm happy with any and all data you are willing to provide.  That said, the question of UR drop rates is still difficult to nail down, especially with the Reserve and Arsenal packs.  There is some evidence that, even on non-DLC days, these packs have the best value.  So, it would be really helpful if people collect UR rates for these packs, and I'd be really appreciate if people continue to log these purchases well after the DLC has dropped.  I'm also interested in Uncommon Weapon Mods / Gear in all packs, and Rare Weapon Mods / Gear in Arsenal / Reserve Packs.

As for recommendations on what to buy for the best values, I guess it depends on what you're looking for.  If you don't care about URs (or you are coming in with a maxed manifest and have more than enough saved up to unlock everything), SPs might be a good value because of the extra equipment / consumables.  But, if you care about URs, then it might be worth gambling on Arsenals / Reserves / PSPs.  Those packs have all seen a boost on day-of-DLC in the past, although there is no guarantee that they will again.  Personally, I'm going to be sticking with Reserve / Arsenal packs.

####MISCELLANEOUS / SUMMARY

One final thing is that I'd recommend keeping a local log of your purchasing.  There is some risk that this spreadsheet gets mucked up somehow, in which case I'd hate to lose the data everyone has collected (though I should technically should be able to revert changes).  If you make a copy of the spreadsheet, you should be able to easily record your purchases locally, and then copy them directly into mine.

Thanks for anything you are willing to contribute!  If you have any questions, ask in the comments or send me a PM.

***Edit***:  In case this isn't obvious, if you are going to record data, you have to do so without bias.  This mostly applies to after the day-of-DLC, should you choose to continue contributing.  If you go on a really good UR run, and then remember - oh hey, I should be recording this, that will introduce bias.  You should decide before spending money on packs whether you intend to record it or not.  So long as you follow that guideline, that particular source of bias should not be a problem.

***Edit 2***:  On the topic of logging when you max a portion of your manifest, it is important to note exactly when in the chronology of buying you did so.  If you buy 20 Arsenal Packs and 20 Reserve Packs, and then max one portion of your manifest in the middle of this buying spree, it is important to know the order in which you bought the packs.  For this reason, I'd recommend recording your packs one by one, in the order that you buy them.  Otherwise, the numbers get mucked up.  You don't have to do this on the shared spreadsheet, but at least do so locally, if you can afford the time.  That way, if I have any questions about your unlock rates, you should be able to provide data that will clear up the issue.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1361864034.0,,PS3,True,t3_198581,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/198581/crowdsourcing_me3_store_drop_rates_part_trois/,

This medium to heavy weight class of weapons is characterized by high damage per shot backed by high accuracy and a built-in scope. They are a favourite of infiltrators, who are able to make great use their tactical cloak with these weapons. However, other classes such as soliders and even certain engineers can also do very well.

As these weapons are typically single shot, they suffer a sharp penalty from shield gating. This issue can be alleviated through the use of Phasic ammo with its remarkable 10x bonus against shields or a class that has a shield stripping power (such as the Salarian Infiltrator).

The mighty Javelin and Black Widow are two of the most potent weapons in the game and in the hands of a skilled user can drop multiple targets in quick succession or take down a boss in a hurry. Another powerful, but more unique gun is the Collector Sniper rifle, a deadly weapon that is able to maintain constant pressure and damage.

It is worth noting that almost all rifles possess a hip fire damage penalty and it recommended that the scope is used, even if only to quick scope.

Heavy pistols are favoured by many power casters for this combination.

Due to the low RoF of many heavy pistols and the aforementioned characteristics, HPs are best suited for medium to long range engagements, usually to supplement the user's powers and finish off enemies.

Standouts in this class of weapons are the Paladin, a headshot machine that boasts similar damage to several sniper rifles, and the acolyte, one of the best shield stripping guns in the game.

Vanguards are an interesting bunch. Some are built around meleeing/tanking (Brawler, Murdertrain), some are built around powers (Novaguard), and some do better with weapons (Asari Vanguard). The N7 Slayer is usually built in one of two ways: [staggeriffic](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11hs40/staggermaster_n7_slayer/) or [pure melee](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11oql7/the_space_samurai_or_how_to_melee_build_slayer/). Those are great ways to build him, and I love them both to death. However, with the recent buffs to Phase Disruptor, I believe that another style is viable. Namely, using his impressive set of power buffs to amp his newly buffed PD through the roof. Here's how to do it.

[**BUILD**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Vanguard/NSlayer/RMDIO/Acolyte1AG5AJ5/////)

* **Biotic Charge**: One of the best skills in the game on certain classes, and the Slayer is one of them. Between this, his dodge, and his heavy melee, he is *the* single most mobile kit in the game. Use this mobility to jump in and out of bad situations and stagger enemies around you. Take Radius to keep you safe and to damage more enemies, and power synergy to amp up further BC's and PD's. Barrier because of course.

* **Phase Disruptor**: The best part about this guy. They just buffed it to drain less shields per cast, with only 20% of your shields with each shot. This, to radically understate it, is awesome. It's got impressive damage and can control a group of enemies while your BC recharges. You're generally going to want to shoot it at the ground near enemies to make sure you don't miss. Take damage, since you'll be spamming it enough that Radius will take care of itself. Take efficient blast, for more shots. It'll give you five shots before needing to recharge if you're not being shot at. Finally, take Armor Damage to help against bosses. This is your bread and butter, to use a cliche. Use it often, and Charge to recharge your shields and keep spamming.

* **Biotic Slash**: Meh. I go three points in just for style points and because I don't need the rank 6 evo on the class passive. Use it through walls only.

* **Passives**: Straight power damage on offensive passives (easy enough). Fitness is where things get fun. I recommend that you take Krogan spec: Durability, then Melee/Melee. The trick with this guy is to use your heavy melee not as your main source of damage, but as a steroid to boost other aspects of your play. It'll give you a 30% power boost for 20 seconds, which is nothing to sneeze at at all. Only use it when safe though-- isolated enemies only, as it leaves you open for counterattack. Also note that his HM will whiff on anyone who is staggering backwards, so let them recover before you cut their heads off-- it's only sporting. His light melee is also fantastic, and also gets amped by his heavy melee. It gives you (i think) 50% DR while doing it, which combined with Charge's temporary DR lets you be surprisingly tanky. He's no Brawler, but it's pretty damn respectable.

* **Weapons**: You just need something to take care of shields. Acolyte or Talon are your best bet, as you'll wreck anything else. I've been taking the Eagle lately, because EEEEEEAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEE.
If you want to support more and have teammates that can take care of shields for you, the Scorpion is another excellent choice. **RECKONING UPDATE**: With the advent of the SMG/Pistol Power boosting mods, they are practically mandatory as they give a great damage boost. If you're against Cerberus, run PB/AP, otherwise go PB/Stunner.

* **Gear**: Take Martial Biotic if you feel comfortable with your level of tankiness, or Juggy Shields if you don't. Alternatively, if you hate his HM animation, you can take BatGauntlets to boost your damage and give a much better animation, which will significantly improve his playability. Power Amps are nice, Strength boosters are also nice, and elemental ammo + Acolyte + PD = explosions galore.

**STRATEGY**

It's a pretty simple combo. Just BC a spawn (preferably one without sync killers, although this guy eats Phantoms for breakfast), teledodge back, and PD them into oblivion while they can't move. Heavy melee when you can, to get the power buff.

This guy synergizes fantastically with just about any team-- he can detonate tech explosions with PD, and BE's with Biotic Charge. He's a generalist in the best sense of the word.

If you want more info on his fantastically awesome dodge, check out the write up I did on the Fury's dodge (which is the exact same) [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/157gst/the_sound_and_the_n7_fury_build/). It will either save your life or end it multiple times over, depending on how good you get. Practice will make you invincible.

The Friendly Phantom is awesome against Cerberus, as long as you watch out for turrets. He does well against Collectors too, as long as you don't get Seekered. Geth staggers are problematic for him, so careful against them. Reapers aren't too bad for the most part, but Banshees will wreck your shit. Stay far away from them.

Lastly, **HOST.** Lag kills Vanguards like they said something about its mother.

**CONCLUSION**

This is just a brief guide on the sort of hybrid power/melee way that I play my Slayer. Try it out if it seems cool, and that the BioGods for that PD buff. Good luck!

1359476847.0,34,self.MECoOp,17i2jw,How to solo on console. ,50,16,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/17i2jw/how_to_solo_on_console/,"So cledio_ify1 posted the novel that is his soloing guide. If anyone is serious about soloing, that guide is very helpful, and will enable you to have a good shot at the challenge. However, I felt that a few points were not applicable to everyone as PC plays a lot different to console. 

For example, [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDaz29uagAk) is how you novaguard on PC. Sadly, the speed and aggression which this guy exercises is just simply not possible on console. You only need to watch the first minute to realize that this guy knows what he is doing. 

I have recently just gotten into soloing. With inspiration from cledio_ifys post. 

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go3fOtxTPdo) is my first attempt. It also showcases some pretty damn awesome music aswell as the appalling console loading screens.

You will see in that video how defensive I am with the novaguard. I actually cut a few bits out just because all I was doing was running away from stuff to isolate them before killing them. Anyone who has played any game with me will know that I am a crazy aggressive player, and defensive play isn't really my thing. Soloing on console totally overturns this style of play.

I cannot stress enough how important running away is. There is no field of view adjustment, there is no running with pizza, no button remapping, no lightning fast response times. Awareness is not as easily increased as it is on PC.  As a player of both console and PC, the console really is shit tier in comparison in terms of how efficiently you can do things. 

So just to summarize, **play defensive as fuck**. Don't bother trying to get the fastest time unless you are confident in your abilities. For the average player who wants to get the lone wolf challenges done, expect each round to take up to an hour or more. Run away, stay in cover and stay away from sync killing enemies as much as possible. Console is very... inconsistent in terms of amount of bullshit that happens. Phantoms and Banshees are lethal unless isolated. Even then they will most likely shit all over your attempts. Take a lot of time to solo on console. The loading screens alone will set you back a few days. 

Conclusion: If you want a well written walkthrough guide, go to cledio_ifys post. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/17chzb/me_coop_college_503_how_to_solo/) is the link. I am not here to rewrite this and steal his thunder, I am simply here to let people know the differences between soloing on PC and console.

Thanks to AaronEh to alerting me to this. 

The original: http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/17h3w7/should_we_have_a_tournamentcompetition/

The tournament: 


Timing:

THE TOURNAMENT SHALL START FEBRUARY 1ST AT 6 P.M. UST-5/EST. IT WILL CONTINUE UNTIL FEBRUARY 8TH AT 6 P.M. UST-5/EST WHEN THE TOURNAMENT SHALL END. ALL ENTRIES ARE DUE (IN A POST I WILL PUT UP LATER) BY FEBRUARY 10TH AT 6 P.M. UST-5/EST.

These challenges have to be completed within the timeframe.  You cannot use past videos/pics as entries for the tournie.

for each challenge, there will be two competitions: one on gold and one on platinum.  THen, each challenge is split up two more times: a competition for the master race, and a competition for all us console peasants.

The challenges:

* fastest solo/4-man team completion (4-man team map: glacier)
* lowest leveled team with an extraction (use common weapons/characters for more points) (map: condor!  just kidding, goddess)
* worst load out challenge - using this thread:  http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/14z15u/what_is_the_worst_class_you_can_create/ , everyone chooses a loadout from here.  To win, you need to have the fastest extraction. (map: jade)
* All-volus team speed run (map: white)
* Team of destiny challenge: to win use the following teams and faction and complete the specific challenge to win.  The teams and designated factions were made with an RNG, so there was no bias on my part.


Set 1:

* The classes: Batguard, Vorcha Soldier, Gethgineer, and basic Humdept.  

* The faction: Collectors.

* Map: Vancouver.

* Challenge: Fastest completion time

Set 2: 

* Characters: Havoc, Asari vanguard, demolisher and Voldept.

* Faction: Reapers.

* Map: London.

* Challenge: Most points accumulated across the whole team

Set 3:

* Characters: Fury, Geth trooper, Infidrell and Paladin.

* Faction: Geth.

* Map: CONDOR!!!!!!  Just kidding (again).  Dagger.

* Challenge: lowest leveled team with an extraction


The winner of each challenge will (hopefully (come on mods!)) get a flair saying something like ""1st place fastest plat solo"" or something and maybe a badge like the one salsadips has.



For the completion time challenges: to get your time, take the total time, and subtract the time spent on objectives.  This raw time will be used in the tournament.  If you could post it in your entry post, that would be great.  This is to keep things fair, since some of the objectives are easier and some are painfully difficult.



For each challenge, each person has to be a different kit.  So no team of 4 gethfiltrators with Javelins.



For maps, bonus points if its hazard version.



You can only be part of one team for one challenge.  For example, I can do lowest leveled gold extraction with Fanboy, Demigod, and RandySimon, but I can't do fastest gold extraction with those same people.  TWO people have to be different every time.  I could do fastest gold extraction with Demigod, C_K_B, and SelfishIdol.
So use this time until the tournie's start to plan a team, make a strategy with your friends, design builds, etc.



If anyone has more challenge recommendations, we're still open until January 30th.



AND...recommendations are closed!  A meet-up thread shall be posted shortly.

1349932106.0,35,self.MECoOp,11anf7,UR Drop Rates for SPs vs. PSPs,38,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11anf7/ur_drop_rates_for_sps_vs_psps/,"First of all, a big thank you to AaronEh for providing an enormous volume of stats for SPs.  He purchased 162, which along with some of the other stats people gave me, makes for a pretty good sample size.  Unfortunately, this sample does have some limitations - since AaronEh already had a maxed manifest going into the DLC, it didn't take a ton of SPs to max out anything except for his URs.  I'm going to post the numbers, but take note of the very large margins of error on these:

Item|Expected Drops per 100 SPs|Margin of Error
:---|:--:|:--:
Rare Character|28|+/- 13
Rare Weapon|41|+/- 12
Rare Gear|24|+/- 7
Rare Weapon Mod|41|+/- 10
Ultra-Rare Character|4|+/- 3
Ultra-Rare Weapon|7| +/- 4

I've left out uncommon gear as there was almost no data on them.  I'm assuming most people here have their Uncommon guns and characters maxed, so those have been left out as well (and I had no data on them).  Since this isn't really a complete distribution for the Spectre Pack, I'm not throwing it into a pie chart (sorry, sleepyelephant).

As you can see, the numbers are pretty unreliable for everything except for the Ultra-Rare items.  The number of Ultra-Rare weapons came out to about 1 for every 830,000 credits spent, which is not far off from what people have anecdotally claimed in the past for SPs.  So, how does this match up with the value for PSPs?

It's not even close, and the statistics indicate that we can be pretty confident about this now.  We're up to nearly ~~40~~ 50 million credits worth of data on PSPs, and the numbers haven't really changed since I last posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/118nfg/item_drop_rates_for_psps_preliminary_data/).  But the uncertainty on the UR weapon drop rate has come way down, and we're now looking at a 95% chance that the expected number of URs per PSP is between 0.14 and ~~0.22~~ 0.21 (thanks to rhyshawkins for adding another huge volume of PSPs to the dataset).  And, keep in mind, the chance that it's 0.175 is *much, much* higher than the chance that it's 0.14.  We can also rule out the odds that the rate is lower than 0.12 as pretty much negligible.

So, as it currently stands, PSPs appear to offer a *far* better value on UR weapons.  The best guess we have at this point says that 830,000 spent on SPs yields 1 UR, and only 550,000 on PSPs does the same.  Even if we look at the more unlikely cases where we've observed anomalous data, the two don't even out on credits spent until you assume something like PSPs drop URs at a 15% rate and SPs drop them at a 10% rate (both scenarios that are looking increasingly unlikely).

Finally, I'd like to announce awards:


**Luckiest:**  Lights_1, who managed to unlock an astounding 5 UR weapons in only 11 PSPs.


**Unluckiest:**  PostCool, who only managed 4 UR weapons in 31 PSPs.  Still a 13% rate, which, compared to how things used to be (I'm pretty sure) is actually okay.


**Biggest Contributors:**  AaronEh and sleepyelephant, who contributed 162 SPs and 68 PSPs, respectively.


**Best Hoarder:**  RepublicanShredder, who had the restraint to spend only half of his obscene fortune.

Weapons: Prefferably SMG's, Heavy Pistols (but not too heavy) or a Light Assault Rifle. Keep the cooldowns quick, and the bullets flying.

How to play: Simply mine, cloak, run detonate for all combat situations. Soon as a team-mate goes down, cloak, run, revive and pop that shield boost for max shields for you and him. Simple stuff really, stand behind cover, keep out of fire, and try not to get a suit puncture (**POP**)

I've only played 2 rounds with it in Silver, and you basically play it like the vanguard. Charge in, stimulant, Reegar, repeat.

Here's a solider build that absolutely kills on Gold:
http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#15PKALKT4@0

Your play style will be in a cycle:

* First and foremost, you need to have **all three tiers** of your health regen active. Note that this means you need to kill two enemies until your Vorcha does his shriek and the screen goes extra red. At this point, you're almost invulnerable. So take it easy and get some careful kills. I use a smart choked Claymore because the thing is a BEAST and pretty accurate at range.

* Once you have your rage going, it's time to get in close. Note about melee, it staggers pretty much every non-boss type enemy. And it is QUICK. Get your first melee kill to activate your 75% melee damage bonus and go to town.

Other notes:

* Your flamer is good, but careful because you're very exposed when using it. Get behind or beside armoured targets when their attention is elsewhere. I barely use it on Gold because it's just too damn risky and I do way more damage with my Claymore and melee attacks.

* Remember the 5 Ds of dodgeball: Dodge, Duck, Dip, Dive and Dodge. The dodge for a Vorcha is the best in the game. No awkward rolls in any direction. If you find yourself in a tight spot, bounce around a bit. You should have you health back in a second or two.

Weapon choice is personal preference but if you HAVE the Claymore, you will be unstoppable. And that's a tomasziam guarantee!

Oh, final note. Unlike EVERY other class where tradition is to panic as soon as your shields are gone, Vorcha will spend the majority of the match bare bones. You need to get a feel for this. Practice makes perfect! The first few matches I played Vorcha I was embarassing myself until I found my groove.

**Krysae sniper rifle**

[One isn't using this gun. Guess which one. Just fyi, only me and exxtrooper were communicating on skype. Other two were just randoms.](http://imgur.com/67nXv,rHySf)

Krysae + Firebase white + geth = industrial level farming (As the picture clearly shows).

With regards to balancing, if the damage is going to be kept the same, the shield gate needs to come into effect and the clip size reduced to two, maybe even 1. Else, the damage just needs reducing.

**Combat drone**

The is literally no reason whatsoever to use this. Why is a power like this even available? Needs a serious buff. 

**Turian and Batarians**

In my opinion, the movement penalty for both these characters are totally unwarrented. Granted, I love using the Batarian soldier, but I am less drawn to it because of the movement penalty. The Krogan however, I can understand, for its sheer ability to absorb ammo.

**Assault rifles and SMGs [Excluding N7 weapons]**

Again, on gold difficulty, they are just marshmallow guns it seems. No reason to use a full auto ahead of anything else. SMGs need a damage buff, or at least introduce a damage drop off which makes it very effective close range, but more or less useless at medium to long range. Another idea I had would be the ability to ARs a mod which allows it to detonate biotic/tech combos. This would make it a very versatile weapon, as assault rifles should be. 

**Geth plasma shotgun**

Not a huge concern of mine, as there is other shotguns which are as effective, if not more in certain circumstances, but I do think the clip size could be reduced to 3 instead of 5.

**Drell vanguard**

If you want cluster grenades, drell adept is a better choice [for biotic combos] and if you want the biotic charge, the other vanguards are all better choices [they are not so squishy]. Just needs removing or give it the ability to setup biotic combos.

**One hit kill enemies**

Not really an issue as such, but it would be nice to give an option to escape, as is with the husks. Maybe a random button combo, or just *something* to prevent the insta-deaths caused by a phantom sneaking up behind you or the banshee tractor beam.

**Every female character needs to have *dat ass*, as the Quarian and Asari does.**

Whenever I join a Gold match the people in there seem to know what they're in for and we normally do pretty well.

People actually use equipment in a tight situation and won't hesitate to revive themselves if they're needed.

***Weapons***

The Hurricane. You all know why you have this. Bosses. Onwards.

The motherfucking FALCON. A shadow of its former self for those who remember when this gun was brokenly OP. Bioware was subject to a mass outcry to people declaring the Falcon dead to never be used again. Which of course was stupid. The Falcon is still a god tier weapon for those who use it and id consider it one of the best ARs in the game. 

*'But Salsa, the harrier is better! Its easier to use, has a better damage output an..'* NO. We will have no speak of this blasphemy in the holy church of the Falcon. 

Lets continue.

[This is a Harrier](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YkFIvO1VfrY/TFj6BpCCuEI/AAAAAAAAT5I/73TMtwEhbPA/s1600/Montagu's-Harrier-melanisti.jpg).

[This is a Falcon](http://lsd.dula.tv/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Falcon-Kick.jpg). 

Whose side are you on now?    

The correct answer is the Falcons. 

**'But what about the Striker?! You can missile glitch better with that!'** ....*sigh*. 

Now back to gameplay. The Falcon has HUGE crowd control. The best in the game. Only pre-nerf Krysae rivalled it. Perhaps the best argument to why you should use this weapon is that it simple trivializes Phantoms and Dragoons, thus making the Cerberus faction a complete joke. 

The other similarity the Falcon shares with the Krysae is its proximity based detonation. Therefore you don't even 'need' to aim. Just lob a ball in the enemies general direction and you will score a hit and a primed enemy, which brings me to my next topic.

***Ammo Powers***

This is a no brainer. Disruptor or Incendiary. You could get away with Cryo aswell but you won't nearly be as effective IMO. If you are fighting Geth, choose Distruptor to stun targets. If you are fighting Cerberus, either option works well, I prefer Incendiary personally because it works better with the hurricane for Fatlases. Reapers - Incendiary is a must. Try to avoid reapers if you can. Too many large armoured targets. The same goes for collectors in the later waves. You will be using the Hurricane more if you happen to get either of these factions.

No reason to use any other ammo power as the Falcon ignores armour reduction anyway, it can't pierce cover and the base damage isn't that high. 

To summerize, strong points to the Falcon are as follows, but not limited to:

* [Phantoms? What Phantoms?](http://youtu.be/NnhF2yEaE_4?t=20m15s)

* [Cover? What cover?](http://youtu.be/NnhF2yEaE_4?t=8m9s) 

* [Bouncing bombs round corners to fuck up campers.](http://youtu.be/NnhF2yEaE_4?t=17m16s)

* [Amazing crowd control](http://youtu.be/NnhF2yEaE_4?t=9m39s)

* Tech combos EVERYWHERE!

* You get a 1337% increase in hipster points.

* Its a rare weapon. Most players will have access to this weapon, even if it is at a low level. 

* Its practically a noob tube and as Call of Duty has taught us, they are awesome. 

___

***Geth Turret***

With a single *floop* you now have a turret buddy who gives you shields and pew pews bad guys while giving you time to flee into cover. If you don't [love this adorable motherfucker](http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/332/6/7/emotional_attachments_by_fakefrogs-d5mfnp0.jpg) then you have no emotions who probably used his [Yoshi as a platform](http://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/picture/stacey83/Betrayal.jpg). 3 points to this, as you aren't using it as an offensive tool. 
___

***Overload***

Shields? What shields? VS shielded humanoids, use as follows: Overload &gt; Shoot &gt; Overload = ASPLOSION. Spam as much as you like when you aren't birthing replacement turret buddies. Chain overload is great here as your Falcon will be priming several targets at the same time, so why not detonate them at the same time? 5th evo is optional, I prefer the more spammable overload personally. 6th is optional too. Choose Chain overload for more asplosions. However, one shotting shields on stuff is often a more useful choice in general. 

___

***Hunter Mode*** 

A very run of the mill hunter mode. 4th evo is optional though for the gethgineer because it actually has a power on a cooldown. So thats your choice to make. I personally use accuracy because I use a lot of different weapons with my engi and I don't fancy respeccing every time I choose another weapon. Rate of fire so you can floop more floops. Speed and vision because you get a much more survivable unit, which is invaluable on higher difficulties.
___

***Passives***

If you want to put three in here and 5 in turret buddy, go for it. There really isn't much much difference in effectiveness. Different strokes for different folks. Rank 4 is personal preference, rank 5 is a no brainer. The falcon cant headshot. 

___

***Fitness***

Another no brainer. Full health and shield bonuses.

___

***Equipment***

Cyclonic mod + AR amp are self explanatory. Shield power cells is also a good option. Barrage gear helps with Hurricanes lulwut recoil and also grants you some extra ammo for your Falcon, so you don't have to keep running back to the box though its not that necessary if you don't mind hurricane recoil. Could be changed for something to give additional consumables. 

___

***Conclusion***

Here you go. You are now the [stagger master](http://i.imgur.com/QCZNEY7.jpg). Enjoy.

It's been a while since I played this game, and a longer while since I submitted a build. However, I played a round of Kroldier, and Carnage... awakened something in me. The sight of exploding bodies brought out my bloodlust. I now understood the Vorchagasm. I needed *more*.

And that's what this build is. It's not meant to be good, it's not supposed to carry in Platinum. It just wants to turn enemies into unrecognizable chunks, and it does that with a vengeance. So if you've got a hankering for meat, then break out your Tostitos because it's time for... CHUNKY SALSA.

[**BUILD**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/Battlefield/RRAPO/Scorpion10BK5BP5//PistolRailAmp3/PowerAmplifierModule3/BatarianGauntlet5/)

* *Adrenaline Rush*: This is meant to boost your other stuff to make for more explode. This setup will boost ~~Carnage,~~ the Scorpion, and your melee all at once, so use it whenever possible. Wait, what? Who said ""survivability?"" IF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE, GO TO SOME OTHER NAMBY-PAMBY BUILD. IF YOU WANT SOME GODDAMN SALSA, STICK WITH ME.

* *Carnage*: Oooooh yeah baby. Kill an enemy with this, and they'll explode into gooey bits. This is the skill that got me into this, and it's still your best bet. We're going max damage, without armor damage-- very few armored enemies can be chunkified. Try to only use it to finish enemies off for maximum chunkification. Also, since it is our finishing move, incapacitate is useless, so take recharge.

* *Frag Grenade*: No salsa, no points.

* *Passives*: Take Power damage where you can, and Weapon Damage when you can't. For Fitness, go Krogan or go home. Health/Melee/Melee is your best bet. With this, when you kill a dude with HM, it'll also boost your Scorpion! So exploding dudes' heads lets you explode their friends more easily! SALSAAAAAAAAAAA


**WEAPONS**

You can either go Scorpion or, if you're just feeling like not contributing at *all*, go Krysae for style points. Either will chunkify enemies. For Scorpion, take HB and PA. For Krysae, take whatever the hell you want. If you're that crazy, I'm not even going to try to tell you what to do.

**GEAR**

Only thing mandatory is the BatGaunt. It'll explode heads, which is fun.

**STRATEGY**

CHUNKY SALSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Shoot mans, Carnage mans, Punch mans. For maximum chunkification, play Cerberus, as they have the most chunkifiable enemies-- everyone but the Turret and Atlas can be chunkifacted.

Verbatim from BSN post:

Praetorians can suffer double hits from the front and back.  In addition, with massive amounts of piercing (Javelin + Drill 3), you can get double hits through the demon barrier technique.  

In addition, Praetorian headshots actually do 2x damage, not 1.4x.  Here's how it works:  

Scenario A)  Double Hit when faceplates are up:  
Shots hit as follows:  Ammo damage, bodyshot, pen ammo dam, pen (bodyshot or headshot, depending on where you hit.  Headshot does 2x damage)

Scenario B)  Double hit when faceplates are broken (warning: inconsistent)  
Shots hit as follows:  Ammo damage, pen ammo dam,  pen (body or head shot, depending on where you hit)  
It is also occasionally possible to get a full double hit as when the face plates broken.  
Depending on where you hit, you can also get regular bodyshots and regular headshots


Scenario C)  Double hit on the Praetorian bubble  
Shots hit as follows: ammo damage, bodyshot, pen ammo dam, pen (body or headshot)

The builds listed will be built around my playstyle and should not be followed blindly. To help compensate for that, I will provide alternatives that will hopefully provide enough breadth so that you can find your niche with each kit.

I personally love Sentinels, as they are jack of all trades and tanks. I've completed playthroughs of the Sentinel in ME2 and ME3 (completing my Insanity run thanks to a Sentinel) and my first few loves were the Human and Turian Sentinels. I'm confident with bringing any Sentienl into Platinum, though I don't enjoy latency when using the Krogan Warlord is in play and the Batarian Sentinel is one of my least favorite kits out there. 

Each kit will have it's own comment inside this one and will follow this format. Any relevant posts will be hyperlinked in.

**Kit [Name](build link) [Ammo]** - A brief list of how the kit is setup.

**Build Goals**- a short description of how the build operates

**Why Weapon X**- weapon choice is as important as kit choice and thus deserves its own section.

**Minor Alterations**- Sometimes you just need minor alterations to a build to make it better for certain users.

**Ease of Use**- A rough estimate on how much margin of error you have when using it. Easier to use kits will have more room for mistakes than those that kits that are harder to use.

**Platinum Strength**- Most kits do fine on Gold- difficulties, but the boss rush on Platinum is a whole different level. This is related to Ease of Use, but the two aren't that integrated. For example, a low health/high DPS kit will be hard to use but have excellent Platinum strength.

**Alternative Builds**- Many kits will have other good builds to choose from and will be discussed here. 

______________________________________________________________

On Sentinels in particular, they embody two beliefs. The first is being a jack of all trades, working with both Tech and Biotic powers. This means that each Sentinel can work with any type of team, giving players the ability to take kits into PUGs and Unknown/Unknown games without worrying about a certain team or enemy composition. The second is being the party tank. As a whole, Sentinels are tough kits. Either by large health pools, good damage reduction skills, health/shield regeneration, or a combination of the three, Sentinels are far from squishy compared to other classes and are only rivaled in tankiness by Soldiers. There is a small learning curve with most Sentinels though, but that is due to their huge flexibility.

###Introduction

Bored of using guns? Want to reduce your enemies into goo? Do you like playing risky for the priiiiize? Then the *new and improved* Geth Glass Cannon may be right for you! Gold viable, insanely fun, and now 50% more eco-friendly! ^t

[*Geth Glass Cannon? Do you mean this build?*](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/15ayke/geth_infiltrator_the_real_glass_cannon/)

Nope. This is the original GGC, the first (and possibly only) widely used melee infiltrator.

*But why should I play a melee infiltrator when I have a perfectly good Javelin X over here?*

Good question! Can Javelin X take out 3 Phantoms or Dragoons in less than a second? This guy can. While Javelin would be superior in single-target DPS, GGC inflicts huge amount of damage around a large radius, allowing you to kill multiple enemies at once.

Before we go on, you need to know that GGC is created for Geth and Cerberus. ***Reaper and Collectors will give you a VERY hard time (because of Ravagers and Abominations).***

###[Build](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/Geth/MOKAK/Wraith4BG5BH5///AdrenalineModule3/HydraulicJoints5/)

Some parts of the [build](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/Geth/MOKAK/Wraith4BG5BH5///AdrenalineModule3/HydraulicJoints5/) are optional.

* *Tactical Cloak*: **Duration, Melee Damage, and Bonus Power**. Duration will make you essential in 4-point hack objectives and make TC an essential power for your survival. Melee Damage is no brainer. *But Bonus Power,* I hear you say, *surely that's madness!* Bonus Power is actually very useful for GGC. I'll explain that more in a bit.

* *Proximity Mine*: **Radius, Damage Taken, Damage**. A typical debuff build. We don't really ""need"" it per se, since we'll be able to two-shot every enemy other than Atlases and Primes anyways. It's for staggering groups of enemies (so that you can safely run into and melee without them hitting you first) and debuffing Atlases and Primes when we engage them. Bonus Power of TC makes sure that we have time to position ourselves after the PM to deliver the burst melees in the most safe and efficient manner.

* *Hunter Mode*: **Power Recharge, Power Damage, Speed &amp; Vision**. Only one that is really essential is Speed &amp; Vision. Power Recharge helps when you use up all of your cloak and actually have to use the entire cooldown time (ie. 4-Point Hack), and Power Damage is more useful in my opinion because you will be using Proximity Mine more than your gun. However, if you don't like them, change them as you see fit.

* *Networked AI*: Skip it. This might be one build in the entire universe that actually skips the race passive entirely. If you don't want the final evolution in PM, put the points here, but the difference will be negligible anyways.

* *Fitness*: **Melee Damage, Martial Artist, Power Synergy**. We need all of the melee damage buffs.

* *Weapon*: a light shotgun that can pierce through cover/Guardian shield. Shredder/High-Velocity Barrel is suggested. Omni-blade V is a must (Blade Attachment V is fine for Silver, but from Gold a burst melee is no longer powerful enough to kill a Phantom instantly). I like to take my Wraith IV.

* *Gear*: **Hydraulics V.** 20% extra damage is nothing to scoff at.

* *Consumables*: **Adrenaline Module**, especially III, is highly recommended.

###How to Play Part 1: Offense

**The basics** of GGC is very simple: Cloak, Proximity Mine ^(Optional)* , burst heavy melee (see Burst Melee section below), run away, repeat until enemies are dead. Your priority targets are groups of small boss units, such as Geth Pyro and Phantoms. Find one or a group of them, double heavy melee and they should be dead. However, **there are a few enemies that need special treatment:**

**Guardians**: Their shield will block your heavy melee. Either sneak up behind them and melee (running past him also works, but only if his attention is away from you) or use your shotgun with the shredder/high-velocity barrel. Note that these methods are your last resorts, and you should stay away from them if you can. Kill other enemies first. Deal with these guys later.

**Atlas/Prime**: Your DPS is still great against both of these enemies, but their weapons will shred you. Atlas's DoT with the missiles will remove your health very quickly. Prime's stun drone and turret will result in many broken keyboards. If you're playing Gold smart, they should be avoided until the last minute anyways. Engage them if your teammates have their attention.

**Turrets**: High priority targets. With these around, you wont be able to kill anyone. Be patient. Cloak, wait until the turret faces a different direction, then give them a big synthetic-to-synthetic hug. Upon their death, they cause an explosion that will stagger you. You can avoid it by keeping the Turret just at the edge of your AoE.

**Geth Bombers**: If they're flying toward you after a bombing run, they're trying to melee you. Backpedal a bit to avoid the melee (and the stun), and when you're at a proper distance, burst melee.

**Geth Rocket Troopers**: If it has already ""targeted"" you or you have its attention, its rockets WILL follow you even if you have TC.

Also, try to avoid initial spawn kills, ESPECIALLY THE ONES WITH ATLASES. The spawn damage resistance will force you to use multiple burst melees. More time spent attacking means more chance for enemies to kill you.

*A special exception about Phantoms. Phantom's hand of denial/bubble shield protects them from your heavy melee. Sometimes, Proximity Mine make Phantoms use their bubble shield, so do not use the mine against them. TC + Burst Melee is still strong enough to kill them instantly.

##Burst Melee

So I've been throwing this term around, but what does it mean? Geth Infiltrator can quickly dish out **two heavy melee in about one second**. This means that [you don't have to crouch in the middle of the enemies for 3 seconds like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rhscHj0Nik) and save time (and your life). I have not seen anyone coin a term to this mechanic (or have heard of anyone talking about it at all), so I will call it burst melee.

~~I don't know if this is PC only feature, since I only play PC. It would be awesome if someone can confirm that it works on the console.~~ [It's confirmed that it is possible, but the method is a little different.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1b4zdw/huge_build_update_geth_glass_cannon_aka_the_geth/c93o6ig)

**So how do you do this?** You first sprint forward. When you want to melee, hit the melee key, then when the melee damage is about to happen (the ""electric field"" is a moment away from forming), hit melee again, but this time WITHOUT holding the sprint key (you are still holding the forward key). This will trigger your heavy melee twice in one second.

This is a pretty confusing description. I'll upload a video of my hand movements if highly requested.

Please keep in mind that this **burst melee works best on-host**, and if you're off-host, the delay between the first melee and the second melee should be lengthened so that both melees are actually registered on the host game.

###How to Play Part 2: Survival

This is much more difficult than offense and much more important.

You're the very definition of a glass cannon. You have a huge (especially burst) DPS, but Hunter Mode and all-melee Fitness leave you with paper-thin shields. Not only that, but the **heavy melee (your main weapon) drains your already tiny shields!** This means that you'll be shield-less for something like 70% of the game. And inevitably, you will get hurt, and eventually you'll be running around with 1 bar of health left. You're gonna be running around with less than 300 health for the majority of the game? That's squisher than a Level 1 Drell Adept.

Your lack of shield and health means that you have to rely on other ways for your survival.

* Use **Hunter Mode** to see your surroundings and make sound decisions, such as changing cover and waiting for the proper moment to strike.

* **Tactical Cloak and lightning fast Sprint** will be your lifeblood. A lot of people (including me) often forget that TC isn't just for damage boost. Use it to escape hairy situations. Don't worry about cooldowns; your cooldown is already very low, and you specced TC for duration.

* Geth Hop. Learn to use it.

* Use cover as often as possible. Obvious tip, but still essential.

* **Play safe, play patiently.** Is an Atlas protecting a crowd of three delicious Nemesi? Wait until the Atlas's attention is diverted, or just ignore them entirely. There are plenty of enemies in the map. Risking a Medi-Gel for measly three Nemesi is a silly endeavor.

* So you went down. Help isn't coming anytime soon, but an Atlas, Dragoon, and a Phantom is surrounding you. **As you get up, heavy melee (hold the melee key) to stun or stagger the surrounding enemies**. It will give you just enough breathing room to dash away with a TC.

**Just keep in mind that as you learn this class, you WILL die. A lot. Start from bronze or silver and work your way up from there.**

###How to Play Part 3: Teamwork, Synergy, and Objectives

While teamwork or synergy is not very important for this class, it nevertheless helps to adjust your gamestyle or even your class to accomodate your squadmates.

##Teamwork

* Your speed and duration of TC makes you a great medic. Dart in, kill/stagger enemies surrounding the teammate, revive, then dash away.

* Your Hunter Mode with Speed &amp; Vision, and the fact that you're running around all over the map, gives you a great degree of map awareness. If you have a team with mic, use it to keep your allies informed.

##Synergy

* GGC synergize best with tanks. Tanks, especially the Juggernaut, can attract enemies' attention and gather them around in a crowd, letting you make short work of them.

* GGC synergize well with snipers. Snipers can provide long range support and they wont get in your way while you frantically run amongst your enemies. Bonus points if they're infiltrators, since they'll be able to rescue you in case something goes amiss.

* GGC does not conflict with biotic and tech classes. The heavy melee and PM do not prime (but the PM detonates tech explosions), so your biotic or tech ally can detonate their prime without worry.

* GGC does not synergize well with Vorchas, Krogan Warlord, and other ""kill dependent"" classes. Once you get into the ""zone"" or get used to the offensive pattern, it is very easy for you to accidentally ""kill steal"" from them. You will see me doing this several times to the ally Vorcha.

##Objectives

* 4-Point Objective is your forte. Duration in TC and high speed will let you hack without much hinderance.

* For the same reasons, Object Recovery is easy with GCC. Learn how to run!

* Assassination missions are okay. Targets get extra damage resistance, so you have to burst your heavy melee twice to kill the target Phantom.

* Hack objectives are a hit or a miss. If you can find a good cover, you can effectively contain one opening all by yourself. It also makes it very difficult for a Phantom, Hunter, Pyro, or a Dragoon to ruin your hack, since you can take them down the instant they enter the circle. On the other hand, you have very little medium and long-range offense other than the PM debuff.

* Drone Recovery missions are probably the worst. The drone forces you to lose the two abilities you depend on most: your speed and TC. The drone loses you when you enter cloak, and you can't use your speed since you have to stay close to the slow drone. If the drone upload site is very close (ie. Glacier), and all of your squadmates are with the drone, play support and keep the area around the drone clear of enemies. If not, just cross your fingers and carry the drone.

1362266666.0,32,self.MECoOp,19jpm8,Claymore Sentinel Collector ,39,7,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19jpm8/claymore_sentinel_collector/,"I recently got the Awakened Collector, and I was fairly disappointed. The biotic combos were weak, awakened mode seems terrible, and is just overall underwhelming as an adept.

[Collector 6/6/0/6/6](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Adept/AwakenedCollector/LLANR/Claymore10BH5AP5//ShotgunRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator3/ShotgunAmp5/)

And then I thought again and realized that Seeker Swarm is a slightly weaker version of tech armor.

It provides a 40% DR when fully spec'd out. 

Not only that, but the Collector has excellent shields, only beaten by batarians, turians, juggernaut, and destroyer. 

So when fully put into swarm and fitness, the collector has the survivability of a sentinel.  Actually, I consider him having a better ability to survive due to his awesome dodge. 

That isn't the only thing about him. The other thing about him is that his signature power, dark sphere has no cooldown if you don't detonate it. That means that no matter your loadout, you can cast it. You just have to wait for it to disappear. 

What does this mean? You don't have to worry about weight. You are a weapon master, with both survivability and a nifty little ability.

Why is this ability so nifty? Two words: Warp ammo.

Warp ammo is an ammo power that offers a significant bonus to enemies that have been primed by a power. That means that when you prime enemies with dark sphere, your damage will skyrocket with weapons. Dark sphere plays many roles. It debuffs enemies in the form of warp ammo, it forces phantoms to put up their hand of denial and primes enemies for the biotic explosions of other biotic users.

Now the Claymore has a few qualities to it. The first is that with a smart choke it is fairly accurate. Not incredibly, but just enough to score headshots. The second quality is its ability to ignore shield gate due to its multi-pellet nature.

A headshot with a claymore will kill almost any mook on gold. The only things are armored enemies and phantoms. 

Your dark sphere+ warp ammo combo will do massive damage to anything else. Combine it with headshots for maximum sucess

You have durability, so you can withstand fire, especially when combined with cyclonic mods. The Damage resistance is a great multiplier for your shields and health. This really helps with your dodge when trying to revive teammates. It means you can survive while reviving and then get out of there.

Really any weapon will work. I've even ran with -200% cooldown with success. The key thing is warp ammo and cyclonic mod helps a lot.

Powers:
Dark Sphere:
Essentially most of these evolutions don't do much for you. The final evolutions helps it so that way you can prime as many people as possible. This also helps any biotic teammates as you can mass prime things to be exploded. Combine it with a well timed shockwave and you can have a nice large explosion.

The explosion damage could be switched, but i do prefer that on the rare occasion where a claymore shot doesn't kill a phantom I can detonate it in an emergency and hopefully stagger or kill her. If you run with only the claymore, it does enough damage to keep you viable under cooldown and also it isn't terribly long.

The duration of the power is essentially your cooldown due to it not creating a cooldown as long as you don't detonate it. keep the duration as low as possible so you can spam it when it is needed.


EDIT: Take DoT over recharge. It lasts 10 seconds no matter what. 

Swarm:
Put this up right when the match starts. recharge will help you get to be able to cast dark sphere earlier on really high cooldown rates. Slow would work if you are willing to face a long cooldown when your reapply the swarms. 

Take DR as it is your tech armor and an extra orb is extra DR.

Dark channel: skip this. It is single target and your cooldown will suck. 

Passive: Full weapon damage and headshot damage. You get a lot of damage from this tree. If you like the PPR or collector weapons, then this might make them really effective. 

Personally I don't do well with Collector weapons

Fitness: You need all the health and shields you can get.

On days I score headshots, I've done really well with this on gold. On days where I miss, it does terribly. Everything relies on your weapon skill.

I've solo'd bronze without medi-gel and I nearly solo'd silver if it wasn't for a stealth banshee

That feeling of dread when you joined his lobby, praying to the spirits that he's not going to go down every round and be generally useless?

To clarify, I've got no issue with the kit itself. Minus a decent escape, he's got everything I want in a melee character. It's the people playing him that are the problem. I realize he's particularly vulnerable to sync-kills, given that he handles like an 18 wheeler, but the decision to go all William Wallace on a  pack of phantoms is one that rarely ends with us high fiving at the extraction point. 

I really don't like looking at someone's class and then immediately start wondering if I should back out before it's too late. r/MECoOp has shown me that just about any class is viable in the right hands.

1361943847.0,34,self.MECoOp,19b8wm,Mecoop College - Tips and Tricks 507: Uninstalling DLC for Drops,40,6,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19b8wm/mecoop_college_tips_and_tricks_507_uninstalling/,"Why do it?
---

A common technique for improving the odds of specific drops is to temporarily remove or uninstall any DLC that is not relevant. When purchasing store packs, items and characters will *only* be available if the corresponding Downloadable Content (DLC) is loaded. Removing a DLC eliminates its cards from the available pool, forcing the server-side random number generator to select from a smaller set.

Be aware that a player will temporarily lose access to a DLC's characters, items, and maps, until that DLC is reinstalled. This is important if players want to farm credits and spend at the same time, as they will be restricted in play options.

---

How can I do this?
---

**PC:** At the Title Screen, tab out of the game and open up the folder ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Mass Effect 3\BIOGame\DLC"". Renaming or moving these folders to a different directory will cause the corresponding DLC to fail to load at the Main Menu, while still allowing the game to start normally:

| DLC | Folder Name |
|:-|:-|
| Resurgence | \DLC_CON_MP1 |
| Rebellion | \DLC_CON_MP2 |
| Earth | \DLC_CON_MP3 |
| Retaliation | \DLC_CON_MP4 |
| Reckoning | \DLC_CON_MP5 |

**XBox:** Go into the system settings &gt; storage screen and either delete the DLCs or move them to an external drive. If deleted they'll need to redownload them after spending credits. If moved to an external drive, the drive must be disconnected before booting up the game. When the player is finished spending, the DLC files can be moved back to the system hard drive. (Thanks [teriyakidreams](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19b8wm/mecoop_college_tips_and_tricks_507_uninstalling/c8mh5ds)!)

**PS3:** The game is consolidated into a single file. The only way to remove DLC is to start fresh. Delete the game and re-install. If a digital copy was purchased through PSN, re-download, and [back up the vanilla version of the game to an external harddrive](http://www.gamefront.com/how-to-backup-your-ps3-hard-drive-and-save-games/). This vanilla back-up can be re-used in the future, if the player ever needs to remove specific DLC. It will save time and bandwidth.

**WII-U:** This technique is not possible on this platform. Players can only purchase the WII-U Special Edition in hard copy format. The first 3 multiplayer DLCs (Resurgence, Rebellion, and Earth) are built onto the disc. As the DLC files are not installed to the hard drive, there are no settings or files that can be manipulated.

1360859695.0,32,self.MECoOp,18is0z,Mecoop College 605: Debuffs and Buffs,39,7,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/18is0z/mecoop_college_605_debuffs_and_buffs/,"##Introductory Questions

**How do debuffs work?** Debuffs in this game are added together on top of the something peddroelmz calls the headshot mod. So if I hit someone with incinerate for 900 damage, and that person is affected by proxy mine's 20% debuff, and recon mine's 25%, I do (900 * 1.45) 1305 damage. If someone hits that person with a headshot with their grall spike thrower for 2138 damage, they'll do (2138 * (3 + 0.45)) 7376 damage. The headshot mod is the headshot multiplier of the weapon (usually 2.5, but sometimes 3 or 1) if the damage was from a weapon headshot, or one otherwise (source: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/13807232/1)

The extra damage taken will apply to all damage - power, weapon, power combination, melee etc. The exception to this is the rank 4 perk in tactical scan which provides bonuses only to power or weapon damage. 

**Do they stack from the same player?** No.

**Do they stack from different players?** Generally, yes. Recon mine, biotic sphere and tactical scan do not, but all others - as far as I'm aware - do. All the debuffs are added together and applied to the headshot mod.

**How do debuff powers like warp and cryo blast affect armor?** In the description it says that warp ""weakens enemy armor by 25%"" - what does this mean? When you fire at a target with armor, a set amount of damage is subtracted from your weapon - this amount varies by difficulty. On gold, it's 50 points of damage. Warp reduces this amount by 25% (or 50% if you choose the rank 6 evolution). Warp ammo and cryo ammo have the same effect, and all of these *armor weakening* powers debuff enemy armor for all players.

**How does this effect interact with armor piercing effects from AP ammo or piercing mods?** The interact multiplicatively. If I have a mod that reduces enemy armor by 65%, and my teammate has warped our target for 50% armor weakness, my shots do (50 * (1-0.65) * 0.5) or 8.75 points less damage.

**Do debuffs to movement speed also slow attack speed?** Probably. I don't think it has been tested, but we have a video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF7PHc9KuRM) of an atlas being one-shotted. I'd guess that they built their powers to slow enemies by 75% (30% from recon mine, 30% from tac scan and 15% from cryo blast). The atlas in the video clip does seem to be moving and attacking that slowly.

**If a banshee uses the hand of denial or a phantom puts her bubble up, does that stop debuff effects?** Don't quote me on this, but I vaguely recall seeing peddroelmz confirm that enemies are debuffed, even if they can't actually be damaged by powers. We need a source for this claim though.

Discussion of shield boost and recon mine in the discussion below comes from my thread on the volus engineer.

##Various powers

Quite a lot of powers have debuff effects somewhere in their trees - warp, pull, proxy mine, snap freeze, annihilation field, submission net, dark channel, stasis, and cryo and warp ammos. Most of them work fairly conventionally, but there are a few tricky details to be aware of with one or two of them.

The rank 6 debuff for biotic orbs, like the orbs themselves, is AoE (link: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/14960614#14966814). The debuff is applied immediately after the damage, so if you smash three orbs onto a target the final one will do 30% extra damage.

The description for warp is fairly honest but confusing nonetheless. It tells you it increases weapon and power damage. It does exactly that - ammo equipment damage (say, incendiary ammo) isn't increased (link: social.bioware.com/forum/Mass-Effect-3/Mass-Effect-3-Multiplayer-Discussion-/INCENDIARY-AMMO-MECHANICS-BUGGED-EXPLAINED-14033200-1.html). Presumably melee or power combo damage isn't increased either. 

There's a rumor that if you choose the debuffing option in rank 6 of stasis (the non-bubble one), then armored targets are also debuffed. This is incorrect (link: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/13855086/19#15504551). But there is an interesting little bug. Quoting BSN user corlist:

&gt; there's a bug with stasis. In-game verbatim: ""Increase all damage done to target by 50%. Deal 35% more damage to target before Stasis breaks."" Stasis actually only debuffs targets by 35%. It is assumed the numbers were mixed up.

I'd remind you also that warp and cryo ammo - being armor *weakening* effects - weaken armor for the entire team.

##Cryo Blast

The power freezes solid targets who are down to health and slows down others. The freezing effect will take a second or two to manifest. The power sets up cryo explosions only on targets that are frozen.

The power has 150N base force. [Here](http://pastebin.com/wXKyLYQJ) is what that will staggar. It inflicts no base damage, and, sadly, can't detonate tech explosions.

Even with the radius upgrade it won't affect more than 2 targets.

There's a variable ""speedreductiondurationmult"" in the coalesced file. I speculate that targets are slowed down for longer than they're completely frozen, but this is of course just a guess.

Damage taken debuffs are in rank 5 and 6. Bioware could perhaps add an increase to damage taken to the base power - there's a variable called ""damagetakenbonus"" set to 0 in the coalesced file. We don't know if this capability was actually implemented though.

Why is the evolution ""cryo explosion"" called that when it actually has nothing to do with cryo explosions? I suspect that originally the rank 5 perk ""cryo explosion"" would make the enemy explode on death, rather like the similar rank 5 perk in sabotage. There's still a variable for this ""freezeexploderadius"" in the coalesced file.

If you use cryo blast on a target with shields, the debuff still affects armor underneath

##Biotic Sphere

Casting the sphere does 100 damage and applies 1500N of force to any enemies in range. It also detonates biotic explosions. There used to be a bug where you had to look at the ground in order to cast a sphere if there was an opponent nearby - you couldn't cast if you were targeting an enemy. This was fixed in patch 1.04: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/324/index/14311106.

The sphere lasts for 30 seconds and has a 3m radius at base.

The warp effect applied by the evolution in rank 6 does 100 base damage, affects up to 3 enemies, doesn't interact with incendiary ammo, and - contrary to BSN rumours - counts as a rank 6 power for biotic explosions. An unlisted effect is that it weakens enemy armor by 25%.

Debuffs (and probably buffs) from more than one sphere do not stack

##Shield Boost

Shield boost restores a large initial lump of shields for all players in range, and provides extra shielding 3-6 seconds afterwards. The extra shielding listed is per second, although the shields themselves are given out in quanta four times a second.

Spamming this power, and doing nothing else is a rather annoying way to play. Instead you should look out for dialogue like ""power!"", ""lost shields!"", ""I'm hit!"", and ""PAAAIN!""

* whatever choices you make on other ranks, I reommend you choose the rank 6 evolution which gives damage protection - it's far, *far* stronger than the alternative. Since it provides damage reduction, you may want to read this article on how DR works - social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15699700/. Summary: enemies do (base enemy damage * difficulty multiplier) * ((either 1 or 1.4 depending on whether you're in cover) - (the sum of your damage reduction. example: 0.4 tech armor + 0.5 shield boost))
* Shield boost and the volus heavy melee will together give you two seconds of damage immunity and around 95% real DR. I've survived a meltdown in the hazard reactor using this - give it a try! Spoiler: the room goes a lovely pure white, and enemies continue attacking you during the meltdown.
* Shield boost, like any ability that restores shields, gives immunity for dot effects. Use just before or after banshee warps or novas, or squadmates going through ravager puddles.
* Characters have a shorter shield recharge time if their shields have not been completely destroyed. Because shield boost restores a small amount of shields for 3 seconds after cast, teammates should be able to duck into cover and take advantage of this shortened delay.
* The description for evolution 6 of shield boost says that damage reduction is capped at 90%. According to tyhw on the BSN, this is in fact nonsense. Shield boost and other powers that together total 140% can give you total immunity (claim found here: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15284691/2#15286402)
* There's a bug with shield boost. Having a volus near you activate it while you're reloading causes you to be locked out of powers and firing your gun. Volus affected by this bug are locked out of heavy melee as well. The cure is to heavy melee. Falling off a ledge also works.
* The amount of shields delivered in a lump on activation is a little strange - unlike the extra shields over 3 seconds, it appears to increase with power damage bonuses. This is quite odd, because it makes one of the options in rank 5 of your first passive almost useless. The testers have investigated this, and confirmed that it is not merely a glitch in the powers screen - you actually do get those shields.
* Using shield boost gives the volus immunity to damage for 1.5 seconds.

##Tac Scan

This power has one of the shortest cooldowns in the game. Only one tac scan can be applied to a target at the same time. It also has the largest single target debuff in the game (up to 32.5% for either weapon or power damage) and one of the longest durations. I'm inclined to count it therefore as the best single target debuff in the game.

The power has a rather nice synergy with marksman. Unlike proximity mine, the debuff lasts long enough for one or two casts of marksman.

The rank 5 headshots perk does not work (link: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/13807232)

The rank 6 area scan perk will show up all enemies within 20m of the target for 3 seconds. If no enemy is targetted, it shows all enemies within 20m of the quarian himself. This is a good way to use up cooldowns if you're travelling along with the drone and can't see any enemies.

The power damage bonus in rank 4 applies also to grenade damage. It's unknown if it applies to power combo damage (I would guess not). The main 10-15% damage bonus, however, does apply to power combos.

A little readout on your character's wrist tells you how far away your enemy is in meters. It may come as a surprise to you that quarians use meters, but there we go.

The power has a fairly long animation that can get you into trouble. To get around this, you can either perform it in cover, or you can cancel animation when the cooldown begins.

##Recon Mine

A power which with the right evolution produces a fairly large debuff in a substantial AoE, recon mine also produces perhaps the greatest damage of all non-grenade powers (smash can outdo it under certain circumstances).

You can deploy the mine to walls, ceilings and floors and it will highlight all enemies within its scanning range. Tap the key a second time after the mine arms (this currently takes 3 seconds) and the recon mine explodes. Key facts:

* The explosion isn't blocked by cover, no matter how thick. You also do not need to be off cooldown to explode the mine. I have a six and a half second cooldown on my RM with my volus engineer. I can deploy the mine, detonate it 3 seconds later, and put up another 3 and a half seconds after that.
* Recon Mine's debuff takes effect after the mine has armed (that is, after 3 seconds). [Proof](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/15y4wn/drell_infiltrator_build_billy_joel/c7r0ciu)
* The explosion hits for a base force of 1500N 
* The slow part of the debuff evolution in rank 6 is deceptively useful. Frequently you can arrange for an entire spawn point to be slowed down while you help the rest of the team with the objectives. Taking 5 of the eight enemies out of circulation is very helpful. This is also quite useful for your teammates' AoE attacks (although on objective waves it would be even better if they just left the buggers alone and sat quietly in the hack circle). The slow evolution comes with a fantastic 25% debuff as well.
* Recon mine + proxy mine does not exactly nuke spawns, but at the end of the wave, you should consider replacing your mine so that it covers the area the enemy spawns in. Slowing them down and making them take 25% extra damage from the grenades your teammates will inevitably be throwing at them is a very powerful asset for any team.
* Recon mine debuffs from different players do not stack: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/14108056#14108056

##Sabotage's Rank 6 Evolution ""Tech Vulnerability""

The rank 6 perk in sabotage that increases tech damage by 50% applies to tech bursts as well (link: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/13855086/4#14041115). Remember that sabotage only sets up a tech burst after 1.5 seconds - that is, you actually have to wait for the enemy's weapon to backfire before detonating it with your grenade.

It also affects the heavy melees of the turian saboteur engineer and the female quarian infiltrator (link: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/13855086/5#14143827)

It does not affect:

* Homing Grenade damage
* Sentry turret attacks (apart from the shock attack - this is the only attack to get the benefit of this sabotage evolution)
* Turian saboteur engineer's light melee.
* Sticky grenade damage (these are combat powers), but it does affect the tech bursts/fire explosions that sticky grenades can cause with their interesting little ammo bug (link: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/14214417#14214417)

Tech and somewhat-weapons based teams will have it easier with overloads and energy drains working wonderfully and tech bursts ahoy.  Biotic teams will suffer unless everyone brings an acolyte.  While no enemies can sync-kill, almost all of their units can stun-lock you to hell.  Let's get into them, shall we?

**Geth Trooper**

The basic assault trooper.  A cousin to the assault trooper in terms of use and damage.  Cannot stun (Applause).  Equipped with a Geth Pulse Rifle, but at a stupidly high level.  Someone did the math I believe.  If someone could find it, it would be much obliged.  Has no grenades, but watch out, they have insane DPS, especially at higher difficulties.

**Geth Rocket Trooper**

Upgrade to the Geth Trooper.  Has a shield and a rocket launcher, that can fire up to four seeking, stunning missiles.  Yeah.  Their shots will GO AROUND CORNERS.  I SHIT YOU NOT.  Should be a priority after other units have been taken care of.  Usually spawns in groups.  

**Geth Hunter**

These guys are bastards.  Hunters have shields, can cloak and are armed with Geth Plasma Shotgun, these guys will (in a group) cloak, go up behind you, stun you with a blast from their shotgun, de-cloak, and sit while you get destroyed by the Geth Rocket Troopers, Primes, Pyros and Troopers you forgot about.  And the best part?  THEY CAN SHOOT YOU IF YOU STAGGER THEM.  Be careful.

**Geth Pyro**

Easily identified due to the huge tank on its back and its yellow coloration.  Has shields and armor, so it cannot be ragdolled.  Has (if you haven't guessed yet) a flamethrower!  But its glitched, and the reach is longer than the animation.  So you will get destroyed.  And you can't over cover grab it.  So after the hunters, primes, rocket troopers, and bombers get you out of cover, a pack of pyros will roast you to hell.  and then stomp you.  Because they can do that.  Fuckers.

**Geth Bomber**

Another staggering geth unit, and this little tiny bastard is horrible.  Equipped with shields AND armor, can dodge LoS attacks during its dodges and attacks, and attacks with either a. a shock-like melee attack that stuns you or b. a bombing run that stuns you and can go through gates I believe.  Did I mention that it's tiny and can DODGE LoS ATTACKS?  High priority - if you can hit it.  Use guns.

**Geth Prime**

You didn't think I'd forget about him, did you?  This atlas-tier unit can stun you in three ways, and damage you with four.  First, his melee can STUN YOU OUT OF A BIOTIC CHARGE.  I shit you not.  It also hurts a lot.  His second is his cannon/shotgun which can SNIPE YOU ACROSS THE MAP, stunning you and dealing damage.  His third and fourth are his two pets, which can spawn either next to him or BEHIND YOU.  One is a geth turret.  This is not the friendly turret of the gethgineer.  It has an extremely high DPS rivaling a cerberus turret.  Cannot stun.  THe other is a geth drone.  A little floaty blue robot that looks like a standard engi's drone.  But this one fires a rocket that GOES AROUND CORNERS.  High priority (the prime, not the drone).  If you don't get stunned first by it and the three other units that can stun you.


**Conclusion**

There you have it.  The extremely broken geth faction.  Gone are the days of White/geth/gold.  No more over-cover grabs.  No more nice geth.  These are the days of the stagger-geth, who have no weakness.  If you focus on the troopers, the rocket troopers will destroy you.  If you focus on the rocket troopers, the hunters will get you.  if you focus on the hunters, another will pop up, leaving you stunned for the pyros.  If you focus on the pyros, the bombers and primes get you.  If you focus on the primes...let's say all the other units will be stun-locking you into oblivion.

So remember - tech teams are the way to go.  Grenades with high forces (like multi-frags and cluster grenades) are helpful to stun the opposition.  

Also, my apologies if this is too rant-ish.  I had a terrible game against them the other day, and this is reflecting what I hear on this subreddit about the geth.


Whelp, lets go get them.

We're about to embark on Operation Genesis, and you need a new toy. This build relies on what I believe to be the best assault rifle in the game: the ~~Cerberus Carrier~~ Scope and Stability Modded Hurricane. 

If you have despaired of ever getting your 100 SMG Medals achievement, fear not! You're going to be churning out 3 of those suckers every single game and it's going to feel so so nice. Hell, take 20 Headshots to go with it. You're going to be doing that a lot too. From across the map. With a Hurricane.

If you've specced him correctly he'll start to [look like this.](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz3427cm4f1qzg4clo1_500.jpg)

This build has seen extensive action on Gold, and was tested in its infancy by our friend ginja_ninja. I explained the bare fundamentals of it to him and he immediately grokked the concept and put up 175,000 points on Giant/Collectors/Gold using only his Hurricane IV, handily outscoring both your humble narrator and a highly capable friend running a Turian Ghost with a Harrier X. In fact, I'd say that utterly wrecking Collectors is probably what this build does best, although you'll be demolishing the faces of every other faction too. Let's get right into the nitty-gritty.

-----------------------------------------

***POWERS***

**Tactical Cloak** goes to 4, and this is one of the only Infiltrators where I've ever felt comfortable taking Damage Cloak. I've taken to keeping cooldowns on the lighter side and playing pick-up ball off the actions of my team, so I rarely feel like I need the extra cloak time even in a Hack-4 objective.

**Sticky Grenades** can be spiced according to your taste. I went for straight damage since I've gotten comfortable using them that way, and their assassination power is profoundly effective when we add in Cryo Blast's debuff and Damage Cloak, along with the occasional Cryo Explosion. However, you've got gobs of straight damage flowing from the barrel of your gun all the time anyway, so feel free to mix in the other evolutions to your own preference if you find the grenades too fiddly. Maximal utility is never a bad way to go in ME3. 

The Hurricane doesn't have a huge damage per bullet, so the ammo-power application bug isn't going to do nutbars-damage like on ginja_ninja's Crusader QFI. At a certain point we'd just be gilding the lily, anyway.


**Cryo Blast:** Our monster debuff and headshot setup -- staggers and chills mooks even if it doesn't freeze 'em. Duration is taken since the piffling Radius is only ever going to freeze two enemies, and in that situation it's usually going to be enough to freeze one and shoot the other one in the face, or cloak and run. It should be noted that the cryo effect will jump to enemies in a radius around your Blasted target when it is killed and shatters, which is amazing against conga lines of mooks. No cryo detonation necessary!

**Alliance Training:** weppinz brah

**Fitness:** Taken to 4, Durability

-----------------------------------------------------------


***WEAPONRY***

*Hurricane. Yes, you've been with her forever. She's familiar -- you can still remember the first time you saw her stats on a spreadsheet. You've grown accustomed to coming home to her after a long day and enjoying her massive damage while you drag your mouse or thumbsticks down to try and keep her from climbing the walls. Well, I've got news for you, mister. She's not just your ULM/HVB anti-armor damage hose any more. She is sick and tired of sitting there unloved while you carouse around with your fancy shotguns and sleek Asari Acolytes until a big nasty Brute sends you crawling home to her with a bouquet of grocery-store roses. Can you open up your shuttered ape-like mind and let* ***her*** *be in control for once?!*

As you read earlier, we're taking the Scope and Stability mods, and jacking the Stability up to 100% through the use of a Barrage Upgrade and/or Stabilization Modules. I've put this weapon on many different classes, but it's most at home here. However, once you learn to love it on the Human Infiltrator, I bet you'll want to experiment with the Scope/Stab Hurricane on some other classes too.

Secondaries are left to your personal preference and arsenal. The Scorpion is my secondary of choice because I love the Hurricane/Scorpion loadout the way Shredder loves hairless chimpanzees in space suits. Switching between a Pistol and SMG is super-fast, and the Scorpion will be a great buddy when danger is just around the corner. I like to fire it predictively, shooting it into rooms at angles as I round corners, or when I hear a foe closing in, or to derail stomps, or for closing the door against pursuers, or when my sixth sense for shitty pubbies tells me that someone is about to do something brave and stupid. Lay down your mines, then switch to the Hurricane when it's maximum-dakka time. Worry about reloading once everything is dead -- 7 shots is a hell of a lot of Scorpion, boy-o. You can even be super cheesy and lay down some mines *before* you cloak, and still get the cloak damage bonus on them when they explode.

Do note that although the build link had High Caliber Barrel on it to show correct cooldowns, we can take advantage of the buggy un-added weight from the Heavy Barrel since the Scorpion is not a DLC weapon and we're not using any ULM.

If my love letter to the Scorpion isn't your cup of tea, I've enjoyed the Reegar or a HVB/AP modded Piranha on this build, as well as the Acolyte and Talon. ginja has taken to carrying the Harrier X as a backup weapon for his Hurricane, which will never cease to amuse me. 


--------------------------------------------------

***EQUIPMENT*** 

Highly modular, as a Human should be. We're going to drop some knowledge before we hammer it out. Based on information gleaned from RepShred, I know two things: 

* Armor Piercing and Armor Weakening are two independent variables that feed into each other in some odd way that I'm sure will be clarified by the brain trust in the comments

* Cryo Ammo and Cryo Blast allegedly stack.

I tend to take AP regardless due to the massive damage boost and the fact that piercing cover is often handy if you freeze a foe in cover and they fall behind it. However, this build stands to make use of a lot of the consumable equipment that most people just let pile up and never use. Among my people, it is a sacred tradition to use every part of the premium spectre pack buffalo. Here are a couple sample loadouts I often run with.

**Cheap and Cheerful**

Barrage Upgrade V and cruddy ammo like Warp II or Cryo III so that your Hurricane gets enough Armor Weakening from ammo and Cryo Blast that it nears its full damage output. and for christ's sake throw on that SMG Rail Amp I or Targeting VI I seriously when are you ever going to use those ok ready up gogogo

**Balls to the Wall**

AP IV, Stabilization Module III, SMG Rail Amp III, Grenade Capacity V

*Other Stuff I've Found Viable:*

Adrenaline Modules are great for the flow of gameplay and getting the most GTFO out of your 5.2 second Cloak. This is a build that wants to be dancing around in and out of cover at midrange, and these suckers will help you do that.

Shield Power Cells are good to ya since you want to be playing this build fast and loose, and not having to run and hide too far from the fight. The Power Cells are my personal holy grail and I usually save them for tankier mobile classes instead.

Targeting VI and his big multiplicative brother Vulnerability VI are also both great here.

Heck, you can even take Medi-Gel Transmitter and be the team mom, ya big softie. You usually won't need too many Sticky Grenades anyway. Great for when you as the Infiltrator are up last and manage to screw up a clutch revive.

----------------------------------------

So that's it! Thank you for reading -- I hope you will love this build as much as I do.

**Cloak**

With the buff there really is no reason not to take 6 points in cloak, as it is now simply better than the class passive. If you need more points in fitness, sacrifice points from the passive, not from cloak.

**Dark Channel**

Damage, because duration won't matter half the time. (Either because there is no target to jump to or because you recast it on something else).   
Then Slow, because recharge speed is useless. Cloak cooldown overrides it anyway.  
Finally take the pierce evolution. Dark Channel is so bad against shields and health that an extra 40% damage won't change that. On the other hand, it's amazing against armor and barriers; so let's make that even more amazing. 

Dark Channel has a bit of a bad rep around here because of the way furies fuck over everyone else's biotic explosions.   
But with the huntress there is no need to spam dark channel, just make sure that it is always active (and if possible, not working on shields).   

Against armor and barriers, with all the power damage bonuses, DC does ridiculous dps (1000 against barriers; 800 against armor).   
For comparison, dps of a Saber V (extended barrel V; piercing mod V) with full human passives and warp ammo III against armor is 853; according to the manifest tool. 

One cast of dark channel kills every enemy except banshees, primes, atlases and praetorians.  
For banshees, one dark channel followed by warp does the trick.

Some things worth noting about dark channel:

* If you cast DC while cloaked, the damage bonus lasts for the entire duration
* Is affected by warp's expose, but doesn't interact weirdly with it.
* DC can jump to an unlimited amount of targets (swarmers...). Target has to be within 8m of the last target. 
* Eats through a phantom's barrier in like three seconds. 
* I played a game with a fury and I'm pretty sure the two dark channels stacked without issue. 
* DC is a bit wonky in that you can sometimes cast it around corners without line of sight, but other times it will just get stuck in a wall. 

**Warp**

Typical specs; detonate, expose, pierce. Like on any other class.   
However the insane power damage bonus of the huntress adds another value to warp. It actually does pretty decent damage with this class (1500 against armor, 2000 against barriers), along with the 15% damage increase to everything. 

You want to be spamming this with every cloak cycle, unless you have to recast dark channel. 

**Asari Huntress and Fitness**

This depends on how many points you need in fitness to play comfortably. Just do whatever is right for you there isn't really anything you can do wrong here. For me personally 5/3 is the right balance between damage and durability.

---

**Weapons**

Doesn't really matter. I usually take the harrier, simply because it's the gun I'm most comfortable with. Other great choices are the wraith, the claymore or the talon.

The reegar is great too, but if you want to use that gun, I would recommend giving the asari valkyrie a try instead she has amazing synergy with the reegar. 

I personally prefer warp ammo over incendiary with the huntress for three reasons. 

* It's really easy to get the bonus damage to lifted targets from warp with this class, because whatever you are shooting at should either have warp, dark channel or both on it. That means you will almost always get the bonus damage to primed targets. 

* Incendiary ammo will prevent you from detonating dark channel and give you weak-ass fire combos instead of decent(ish) biotic explosions. 

* If you want to do the incendiary ammo + warp cheese, in my opinion the Valkyrie is better at it (great synergy between the reegar, annihilation field and tech armor)

Depending on your team and enemy, you might also want to take along an acolyte, because otherwise you don't have anything to deal with shields. If you don't like the acolyte, the talon works too.

---

**Gameplay**

[VIDEO](http://youtu.be/1BxttyZIE1g)
---

It's so much easier to show gameplay that it is to describe, so here it goes. You'll have to live with 9 waves, unfortunately.  
But the first 8 waves are probably the best gameplay I've recorded of myself (subtle brag) so I really don't want to throw that footage out because of one stupid mistake (I get swarmed by dragoons and just get staggered to death every time I pop medi-gel).

But despite the really frustrating ending, getting the five waves survived medal in a platinum solo was probably my proudest mecoop moment so far. 

And as a side note, whoever designed wave 9 cerberus platinum is an evil genius. Two atlases, two rocket-troopers, a banshee and unlimited dragoons (and centurions). It doesn't get much worse than that. At least there are no hunters.

Build for the solo was [this](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/AsariHuntress/PLQDJ/CerberusHarrier8BF5AD5/Acolyte10AJ5BA5/AssaultRifleRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator4/ArmoredCompartments5/).    
Just a little more survivable than the build above, the shield-recharge is very nice to have on platinum (delay is longer than on gold), especially because the asari dodge cancels the recharge.  

The acolyte is just for primes and atlases. In a normal game you shouldn't need it (except against geth).

---

**Notes/Tips/Loose Ends**

There are still a couple of things I want to mention that can't really be seen in the video. 

First of all, if you play with other biotics, try to keep dark channel out of the way of their biotic explosions. Don't even try to create BEs with dark channel, just spam warp to help the others out. 

If there are no other biotics, your dark-channel + warp detonations are nice to have, but I still wouldn't recast dark channel unless it runs out or switches to the wrong target.   
If you detonate dark channel, and want to keep shooting at that enemy, don't forget to prime him again so you get the bonus damage from warp ammo. 

Then it's worth mentioning that the huntress is pretty goddamn awful against geth. All her powers are really bad against shields, and I would recommend avoiding geth with her. If you play unknown, take an acolyte along so you aren't completely fucked if you get geth.
If you know you are going up against geth, consider taking the talon or the reegar as primary weapon. 

Collcetors are kind of the opposite, they don't have any shields to slow down your dark channel at all. Combo damage against them is still broken though, so keep that in mind. Scions are an awesome target for dark channel.

Cerberus is kind of the middle ground. The huntress is great against phantoms and dragoons but has problems with atlases and centurions. 

Against reapers, her incredible efficiency at taking out banshees (see wave 4 and 5 of the video) alone makes her awesome. Brutes and ravagers are both really easy to kill as well. And the only thing with shields are marauders, which shouldn't be that big of a deal. 

---

**About warp ammo**

It doesn't seem like this is very well known, but the ""damage to lifted"" targets from warp ammo actually applies to *everything that is primed for a biotic explosion*, no matter if it is flying around or not. 

This is why warp ammo is amazing with the huntress. She has two powers that both prime a target for a very long time.

So, with warp ammo IV, the *ammo damage* is doubled against primed targets.

Here is an example of what that means. Harrier VIII (HV barrel and mag upgrade), Warp ammo IV, rail amp III. Against primed barriers: 

     (124*0.6*2*2) = 297.6 ammo damage per shot 
     124*(1+0.05+0.3) = 167.4 weapon damage per shot
     for a total of 465

Against armor (or health, armor damage reduction is negligible with this setup):

    (124*0.6*2) = 148.8 ammo damage per shot
    (124*(1+0.05+0.3))-50*(1-0.9)*(1-0.65) = 165.7 weapon damage per shot
     for a total of 314.5 

For comparison, here is what a turian ghost does with the same weapon/equipment:

against barriers:

    (124*0.6*2*(1+0.2))+(124*(1+0.2)*(1+0.075+0.05+0.075+0.1+0.3+0.8) = 535.65

against armor/health:

    (124*0.6*(1+0.2))+(124*(1+0.2)*(1+0.075+0.05+0.075+0.1+0.3+0.8)
    -50*(1-0.75)*(1-0.9)) = 445.15 

So against barriers the huntress does 86% of the ghost’s damage, against armor/health about 70%. Considering the huntress has basically no weapon damage bonuses, this is pretty amazing. 

*Of course this is only true as long as the target you are shooting at is actually primed.*

If we take the huntresses powers into account, I'm pretty sure she does more damage than the ghost (just my feeling from playing both of them a lot).

Keep in mind though that the huntress has a glaring weakness against shields. Both warp and dark channel do half damage to shields and warp ammo doesn't work on them.

**Final Words**

I hope you enjoyed my guide. And I also hope that some of you are gonna give her a whirl! 

I've played a lot of gold pugs since she was released, and I don't recall seeing her even a single time, which makes me kind of sad because she is such an awesome and fun character. 

I also really wish that bioware will leave her like she is now. The cloak without weapon damage bonuses makes her a very unique character and I really hope they don't mess with that.

1354270742.0,29,self.MECoOp,141ot5,Bioware can learn a few things about Co-Op from Halo 4,60,31,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/141ot5/bioware_can_learn_a_few_things_about_coop_from/,"For weeks, we have voiced our opinions here on Reddit and (even louder) on BSN about our desire for co-op ""missions"" for ME3 multiplayer. And after playing Halo 4's Spartan Ops, I think Bioware needs to seriously consider implementing a similar system to it.

In case you haven't played it, Halo 4 has a Co-Op mode that isn't just a repackaged Firefight mode from other Halo games. Spartan Ops feature weekly episodic co-op missions, released in packs of 5, where you fight through maps just like a Halo campaign mission, but with a team size of 1-4. Want to go in solo? do it. want to team up with a friend or a random person? go ahead. 

Another epic part of these missions is that these combine the Co-op scoring from Firefight and Matchmaking (get medals and more kills for more points), but these are actual missions where there is a goal. Sure, they re-use maps often and the enemy placements might become tedious, but its still FUN. You move from placement to placement, position to position, fighting through enemies to reach a goal, then you extract back the way you came (usually). Plus the fact you get FemShep (Jennifer Hale) telling you what to do makes it all that much more fun. Oh, and I also forgot to mention... its FREE! High quality voice acting and co-op missions for free. AWESOME!

I'm also very, very impressed with the overall quality of the weekly Spartan Ops missions. They put in a cutscene you can watch with every episode (set of 5 missions) and they have voice actors like Jen Hale and more in them. Its high quality and its like we're getting another game with the main game! And I have a feeling these Spartan Ops missions are leading up to what we might see with Halo 5. And did I mention its FREE?!

Back to ME3's Multiplayer... its just a Hoard/Firefight mode. Fun, but not as thrilling and it doesn't keep me coming back for more anymore. The new characters are cool and the new gear gets better and better, but the context of the battles don't keep me coming back for more. I've played on some of the ""hazard"" maps a few weeks ago, and these are cool for a few times. But in the end, its still just the same old ME3 multiplayer. Its good fun for wasting a bit of time, but ultimately is nothing special. 

Granted, the ME3 MP has an affect on the ME3 story in terms of War Assets and etc. But with Spartan Ops, its totally optional. You dont need to play it at all if you don't want and there are no repercussions with Halo 4. Will there be in Halo 5? We dont know. 

I wish Bioware would have been able to implement such a remarkable gameplay mode with their Multiplayer from the start, and I believe they still can now. We all know Mass Effect 4 is coming in one way or another, they can easily make a weekly/monthly seasonal mission pack where we play through as N7 operatives taking on remnants of Cerberus or Batarian slavers or even the Collectors in various missions. These missions could lead up to a set up to Mass Effect 4. As for the cost, I would love it to be free, but if the cost is low and the quality is high, I'd be all for paying for it.

Hopefully Bioware takes notes by watching and playing Halo 4 and can learn from Spartan Ops. I would hate for the last note of ME3's MP to be ""it was boring."" Bioware has the power to bring it back in force, but they have to do it sooner than later.

tl;dr - Halo 4 has Spartan Ops. Bioware needs to implement a similar system in ME3 MP before we all get too bored with it and leave ME3 on the shelf for good.

EDIT: TIL - never to voice your opinion comparing Halo to ME in an MEco-op board. Honestly, what the hell guys? I cant have a goddam opinion on here? I merely am trying to find ways for Bioware to EXPAND the game. Maybe they can implement this in ME4 or something. Maybe it just didnt come across properly in my post, i dunno. Maybe some of you can be satisfied with what we have now, but I'd like things to improve from here on out for Mass Effect in general. But no, lets NOT try to add new things!

Basically, if you prime a detonation with power X, and somebody detonates the explosion with power Y, then you get challenge points for power X and power Y. 

So basically, you can get a LOT of verity in challenge points if you pick a team that can prime and detonate explosions for each other, and all have different powers.

1345773908.0,34,self.MECoOp,yqbnz,The Classic Infiltrator (Human Infiltrator) {A Long Post},38,4,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/yqbnz/the_classic_infiltrator_human_infiltrator_a_long/,"Another slow day means another opportunity to help those who need good ways to play as the basic Human classes. And with that weekend event coming around the corner, you might want to try something try this class, as it is basically dependent on Tactical Cloak and has very little weight restrictions. Do note that every level 1 Human Infiltrator w/o a respec card has a point into Tactical Cloak.

While I am hiding from Cleetus (formerly Curtis the Imaginary Critic), I will give the low-down on the ""classic"" style of playing the Infiltrator. The only reason it is ""classic"" is because ever since ME1, the Infiltrator class specialized in the use of sniper rifles. This guide will be more cut and dry than usual because of the wealth of information that needs to be mentioned.

The plan of using this character is simple: take out the critical targets. Typically, these are medium enemies that have a decent amount of wave budget points and can pose a significant threat if not taken care of (Engineers, Guardians, Phantoms, Pyros, Hunters, Marauders, etc). While there are times to focus on the boss enemies when they threaten the team, note that killing bosses just makes bosses spawn again until the budget is depleted and inefficient at finishing the wave in a quick manner. 

[Here](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#40PAPNRd1c9@A@@Q4P4V4U4) is the build that I use that is quite useful on a variety of difficulties and against all three enemies.

The reason I put zero points into Cryo Blast is that the travel time of the projectile is generally incompatible with sniping and without it, weight becomes significantly less important due to Tactical Cloak's recharge mechanism. Basically the less time spent in cloak, the faster the recharge is. If someone can word this better/ expand on this /explain it in more detail in the comments, I would greatly appreciate it. Plus, Sticky Grenades can get me out of a problem situation fast and can segment enemies away from each other, much like with a [Shotgun Infiltrator](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/y8gzg/the_cryo_claymore_commando_human_infiltrator/).

Now then, the main question is what choice of weapon to bring.

**Sidearms** - For people who are confident in sniping at any range (not me), a side arm is not necessary. If you are not confident at short range sniping, pick up a sidearm. It could be anything; a Phaeston, Carnifex, Phalanx, Tempest, Hurricane, you name it. I would recommend those as they are good at a variety of ranges and they are relatively lightweight. Most of the time these sidearms will be useful moving from cover to cover and finishing off weakened enemies at the end of the wave.

**Sniper Rifle**- While there are a huge amount of sniper rifles, I can only really recommend these below. The pattern that you will see is:

*Sniper Rifle*- Advantage, Advantage, etc. | Disadvantage, Disadvantage, etc. (short comment)

While on Bronze and Silver shield gating is hardly noticeable on single shot snipers, on Gold and Platinum it becomes obvious that most single shot snipers don't cut it when killing enemies as a Human Infiltrator. Hence, multi-shot snipers are preferred weapon of choice. 

*Black Widow*- High damage/shot, innate 25cm piercing, syncs well with Tactical Cloak cool-down to reload cancel | Ultra Rare, weighty, slow ROF compared to other snipers, low clip capacity (My personal favorite sniper rifle as it can effectively deal with armor)

*Valiant*- Good damage/shot, good spare ammo count, fast reload, decent ROF | Only available as an N7 Ultra Rare as a reward for weekend events (This does a better job against non-armored targets compared to the Black Widow, while the Black Widow does a better job against armored targets)

*Viper*- Uncommon, excellent spare ammo count and capacity, lightweight, good ROF | On the lower end of damage/shot, only gets two shots in cloak (This is a good sniper rifle for the beginner sniper but as better sniper rifles become accessible, its power diminishes relative to others)

*Krysae*- High damage/shot especially vs armor, has AoE damage, can stagger Phantoms, has 2 zoom levels | Low space ammo count, slow RoF, awkward to handle, projectile can lag, proximity fuse is difficult to accustom to (Despite the nerfs to it, it is still a decent weapon that now requires some dexterity to operate)

*Harpoon Gun*- Excellent damage/shot, bypasses shield gating, can be charged for 175% damage and charge can be held while cloaked, can be fired when cloaked, can pierce armor plating on Guardians and Cannibals, fast reload speed | Suffers from projectile lag, cannot charge when cloaked, only one shot per cloak cycle, low powered scope (Unless you understand this weapon well, I would shy away from it)

*Indra*- Excellent RoF, good DPS, can prime targets with ammo powers well, fast reload speed, lightweight | Ultra Rare, burns through ammo quickly, is less effective against armor, low powered scope, may have recoil issues, only a fraction of the clip gets the cloak damage boost (I have an unfair bias against this gun, but it is pretty damn good overall)

**Ammo**- Ammo consumables enhance the lethality of a sniper rifle by a large margin. Personally, there are three ammo types I would use with this character. The first is Warp Ammo, as it does a flat increase in damage to the weapon. I would say this would be generic, but effective if you are unsure what enemy type you will be facing. The second is Cryo Ammo, which with the help of the Tactical Cloak damage bonus will freeze any target you shoot at. Very good if you are not a good shot and want an easy follow up shot (like me). Finally, Disruptor Ammo is useful if you want to strip shields effectively and set up for Tech Bursts.

That was a lot of text, but it isn't the whole story. There is a lot more information to be had, but I would prefer it if you asked the questions. The community is certainly smarter than me and can help you if you post comments down there. Most importantly, have fun out there.

Continuing with the ""Hard On for Humanity"" series as it is another slow day on this subreddit, let us take a look at the basic Human Adept. The quick build is right [here](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#00AQKORW9a9@A@@O4N4V4U4), but note that you will need a power respec card to follow this build. 

This is a power based class, so take that into consideration. If you are familiar with a Batarian Soldier that likes to use Ballistic Blades or the [WubStep Adept](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/search?q=wubstep&amp;restrict_sr=on), this is quite similar.

**What's your beef with Singularity?**- Ever since Mass Effect 1, I did not like this power. It was finicky to say the least and it rarely worked the way I intended it to. In Mass Effect 3 (and 2), Singularity only lifts targets with health, which is a real constraint. I see Singularity as better Pull, but only slightly better. The only two times I would want to use Singularity (crowd control and behind cover), I see spamming Shockwave or arcing Warp as a better option.

**Warp is so bland**- It may be bland, but it's quite useful. Both a primer and detonator of biotic explosions, it is a versatile power. This particular set-up (Detonate, Expose, Pierce) is designed to take down armor and barriers ASAP.

**Shockwave is so lame! It only has a base 16m range!**- Actually, 16m is pretty good range if enemies are constantly advancing towards you. To complement this, it has good recharge time (2.19s is slightly faster than Warp at 2.46s) and definitely helps with crowd control by spamming it several times. Just to be extra awesome, Shockwave goes through walls and floors (Firebase Dagger I'm looking at you) so you don't even have to see your enemy to hurt them.

 What makes Shockwave really shine is the staggering potential. At 1330 Newtons, it will stagger practically all non-boss enemies. In particular, Geth Hunters and Phantoms with barriers/shields up. It buys you some extra time if you are getting rushed by them.

The +65% Detonation effect makes it the best biotic detonator, although the additional range is not a bad investment either. Choose the 5th evolution based on personal preference as both are quite good.

**Why on Earth did you choose those passives if it's a power based class?**- I would prefer not to die when I move into position to use said powers, so that is why I put points into Fitness to boost barriers. The Alliance Training is just so I can boost power damage and carry slightly heavier weapons.

**What weapons should I bring?**- Just about any that allow a high cool-down will do, even a Predator I.

**Guardians are always such a problem enemy, how do I deal with them?**- The simple way is to use Shockwave to push away their shields so you can shoot their fat, slow heads. A more professional way is to set up a biotic explosion behind them so that they get damaged and hopefully knocked down, removing their shield entirely. 

**Shredder, your humanity boner is getting too close for my comfort. Do you have any last minute advice so I can get away from you ASAP?""**- You didn't need to make that comment, but do note that Warp and Shockwave detonate Tech Combos as well. Therefore, do not rage when that Warped Atlas does not explode when you used Shockwave. Someone probably set up a Tech Burst that overridded your Biotic Explosion.

 Also this happens on spawning areas below the map such as on Firebase Giant. Simply look down and do the same. If they are out of sight, you may need to get creative with powers and grenades to hit them. This should save your game from quitters and the like.

The release of the Lancer with the last update has breathed new life into the class for me, and it's become easily in my top 3 most-played classes again.

[**THE BUILD**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/Human/OARNR/Lancer10AC5AD5//AssaultRifleRailAmp3//WarfighterPackage5/)

It's not the best gun or the most overpowered class or anything, but it brings something I value more than that to the table: a healthy dose of nostalgia. When you play this class, it's like you're back in the original Mass Effect, or at least as close as you can get to it anyway. No more dubious thermal clip retcons as an excuse for EA to implement a conventional ammo system to make the game more familiar and easier to design. We're back in the future again.

**THE GUN**

I didn't actually know anything about the Lancer before I got a chance to use it. All I knew was that it was an ultra-rare Avenger reskin, so that was appealing enough to me that they were apparently trying to make a gun that felt like the Avenger but was actually good. I figured it would behave the exact same way as the Avenger with a large clip and high ammo reserve, but finding out I was playing with a ME1 gun shortly after jumping into a game was one of the best surprises I've had in this game so far, at the very least since trying a melee slayer build.

Of course there were some significant downsides to the gun as well and I was determined to optimize it to make it as good as possible. Issue number one is the extremely low stability. Unless it's being fired from cover, the Lancer has a tremendous amount of recoil that severely hampers its potential damage output at medium-long range. Using the stablity damper mod in turn provides a tremendous increase in the overall versatility of the weapon, almost fully eliminating recoil. A much higher percentage of your bullets are going to hit what you're aiming at (the accuracy of the gun was never terrible, stability and muzzle climb is the real problem-causer), and you'll be able to be getting consistent, sustained, headshot damage even at long range. Firing from cover with SD V will make it feel like a geth pulse rifle in terms of stability and accuracy.

Issue number two is that the flat damage the weapon does is somewhat mediocre on its own if you want it to be your primary damage source. Naturally the solution to this is using it on a class with a damage-boosting power. I originally was using it on human infiltrator in conjunction with cryo blast, mainly because I had simply been searching for a new HI gun to use. Turian ghost would be the best infiltrator for the gun because of the passive stability bonus and cloak bonus on assault rifles. However, I came to realize after a while that tactical cloak really doesn't suit the Lancer particularly well because the duration you get a damage boost from after firing just isn't long enough to fully take advantage of its sustained fire properties. A-rush's damage bonus is only 10% less than tactical cloak's and lasts twice as long. The 6.8 seconds will allow you to get the damage bonus on about 5/6 of your Lancer clip (some variance based on gun level, obviously), then let it recharge during the short cooldown. IMO human soldier is the optimal class for getting the most out of the gun damage-wise. On infiltrators you won't quite be able to mow down those armored enemies or systematically take out an entire large group of soldiers in the ~3-second cloak bonus window, and then your damage gets reduced and it takes longer to finish them from there. With more than double the time to have access to the damage bonus, you'll end up being able to kill more things faster with no damage falloff. This is a great gun to use assault rifle amps on as well to get even more bang for your buck. If you have fewer assault rifle amps than you do fingers like most people that play this game and want to save them for plat, don't worry though; targeting VI III is a really great substitute. As long as you're aiming at the head you'll get almost the exact same effect as you would with AR amp III, and getting headshots with this and other full-auto weapons is generally a lot easier than having to line up and time single-shot weapons repeatedly. You won't be able to get the benefit vs. ravagers and atlases, but the damage you deal without the amp bonus being active is definitely still respectable.

Third is the issue inherent to most assault rifles: low damage per shot means armor piercing is a necessity. Since both stability damper and mag upgrade are non-negotiable if you want to get the most out of the Lancer, this means you'll need to have AP ammo IV equipped in every game you play. It is seriously worth it though. 90% armor piercing means that it will be just as effective against bosses as it is against soldiers, and an additional 50% extra damage on top of the 70% from A-rush and 30% from your gear means that this thing is going to hurt *way* more than Bioware originally intended it to.

**THE SOLDIER**

So now your gun is optimized and ready for battle. Give it a girl's name if that's your thing. I don't care. I didn't. Fuck it, I'll do it now. I'll call her Linda. Good enough. Now let's move on to talking about how to use it effectively as well as some of the other choices I made while speccing it out. Here's the general plan for what you want to do:

1. Take your gun

2. Pop America Rush

3. Shoot everything in the face for 6.8 seconds

4. Chill in cover while your ammo comes back

5. Repeat

Not the most intellectually-demanding strategy, but since when were soldiers lauded as intellectuals? The real tactical aspect lies in picking your location, knowing when to use hard cover, when to use soft cover, and when to switch between them. Yes, unlike many of the most popular classes, there is a benefit to actually using the cover system the way the series originally intended with this guy. And of course, cover was a huge part of Mass Effect 1 as well so we get to get a little nostalgia rush while taking advantage of the other benefits.

The main use cover has is that it provides a stability and accuracy bonus. While the natural stability and accuracy ratings your Lancer has are good enough for this not to be required at midrange or closer, if you are engaging enemies from long range it will give you a significant damage increase by tightening the spread of the weapon and allowing more of your shots to connect, as well as eliminating virtually all of what little recoil was left behind by the stability damper. You should always try to get in hard cover before firing at a distant enemy. The disadvantage of hard cover is of course that you're vulnerable to enemy fire while shooting from it, albeit at reduced damage. Sometimes at long enough range though, enemies won't even return fire at you. Also, this gun doesn't have a ramp-up bonus, so there's no reason you can't briefly duck back in cover for a split second to dodge an incoming projectile then pop back out and resume shooting.

When dealing with enemies at close to midrange, it's preferable to use soft cover when the option is available, as you won't take *any* damage from enemy fire and like I mentioned, your accuracy is good enough that most or all of your bullets will hit where you're aiming and stability is almost a nonissue with your mod setup. Remember to **always zoom when aiming** as it will significantly increase your accuracy and by extension your headshot damage. The only time you should fire unzoomed is if you've got a dragoon/pyro/bomber right in your face at point-blank. At that range hipfiring is easier to adjust for their erratic movement and they'll be close enough that most of the shots will land even without zooming.

It's kind of a strange dynamic because overall the cover system works the opposite way from how it should; in general when using this gun, you want to be out of hard cover when enemies are shooting at you and in hard cover when they aren't. Chalk it up to vidyer garms I guess. Basically though the thing to take away from this is that your gun is going to perform better when fired from cover, so when you can afford to be shooting from it without having to worry about taking damage, take advantage of this.

To quickly touch on the recharge mechanic of the gun, how it behaves in conjunction with A-rush is that unfortunately your ammo is not fully restored upon activation (this gun would be broken as fuck if that was the case). It will, however, skip the overheat animation and immediately begin the recharge should you accidentally burn down your clip all the way and overheat it. The best strategy is to only fire the gun while A-rush is active (or for a little longer if you just need a little more damage to finish off that last enemy), then hop into the nearest cover for a few seconds to safely let it recharge to full during the cooldown. The recharge tends to last a little bit longer than the power cooldown (which is extremely short if you only bring a Lancer), so I recommend waiting the extra half-second or so to get completely filled up, *then* pop out and activate again.

Ok, that's the main chunk of writing here. I included preemptive question-fielding for some of the things I imagined people would ask in the second part in the comments, but before you move on to that [**check out this pub gameplay I recorded to see the class in action.**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j7V7Uurbk0)",[Build],False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,PC,True,t3_1jd9na,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1jd9na/the_classic_me1style_lancer_human_soldier/,
1370593390.0,34,self.MECoOp,1funik,Under Appreciated Weapon of the Week: Adas Anti-Synthetic Rifle by Remi_M,39,5,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1funik/under_appreciated_weapon_of_the_week_adas/,"&gt;Ever since its release, the Adas has been thrown into the pile of useless weapons, with such weapons as the Spitfire, GPR, GPSMG, etc... The Adas does not deserve this kind of rejection. No, the Adas is awesome, and this is why:
&gt;
&gt;The Adas does double damage against shields which already gives this weapon a good use, since a lot of enemies has shields. You may say ""but we already have the Acolyte"" we do, and for its use, I have to say the Acolyte does its job better than anything else. However this weapon does not try to replace the Acolyte, because this is not only what the weapon is for, it is merely a bonus. Along with 2x bonus, it ignores the shieldgate which is nice for its slow RoF. It also has a very nice magazine size, and since you don't need AP ammo on it (projectile weapon), the magazine upgrade is very viable and gives you a great magazine that you can kill a lot of enemies with without reloading.
&gt;
&gt;The Adas is really friggin' accurate. It has no recoil, and the shot will actually bend a little to hit your target if you aim next to your target. This makes it very easy to use this weapon. it also has an AoE, and will stagger your enemies rendering them useless whilst you're killing them, you can even stagger some boss enemies with it.
&gt;
&gt;Now we're getting to the part where the Adas really excels; applying ammo powers. It will apply the ammo power to every single shot you fire. Using cryo ammo on this weapon is actually really awesome. You can freeze 1 enemy with 1 shot, then freeze the next 3, then go back and kill the first enemy, then the rest. A weapon that can make use of cryo ammo is already good in my books. But it doesn't stop there. If you put Incediary ammo on this weapon and you have a detonator, for example proxy mine, you will have fire explosion everywhere.
&gt;
&gt;There is one part about the Adas I do not like, and that is its RoF. it has a really slow base RoF. This is why I only play this weapon on the Quarian Marksman, Destroyer and sometimes the Turian Soldier when I want to detonate fire explosions. This weapon is not a secondary weapon you use for killing shields. It is a primary weapon that does a good job with shield slaying.
&gt;
&gt;The Adas Anti-Synthetic Rifle is this weeks weapon of the week, because it is a weapon that is very rarely used, but is actually really awesome. Not only can it do great, but using it feels awesome. If you say that the Adas isn't awesome, take a look at [Quarksman the Geth Slayer](http://i.imgur.com/R5iYRJo.jpg) and try to tell me that it isn't awesome. It may not kill everything in half a second like the Piranha or lolreegar, but it isn't a bad weapon, it does good damage if you play it right, and IMO it's more fun to use this weapon than the formerly stated weapons.

*Launch Fire also makes burning enemy explode.  Very good for building up YAAAGH!*

(Carnage is your detonator power for Fire explosions.  True, it's only a level 3 power, but this only drops the damage from 1687 for a 6 + 6 FE down to ~1300 for your 6 + 3 FE.  *Some* loss in damage, but nothing too dramatic.  Fire Explosions have decent AoE, which makes for good crowd control and they have a small DoT effect which keeps shields and barriers from regenerating.)

(Another tip is to launch an Acolyte bolt and immediately follow it up with a Carnage shot.  The Acolyte strips shields so the Carnage does some damage and it also momentarily stuns your target so they won't flip or roll out of the way.  If you bring Disruptor Ammo and time your shots well, you can set off Tech bursts with this one-two combo, too.)

**WEAPONS &amp; EQUIPMENT**

*GUN!!!*

*Acolyte is good weapon for me.  It may look like Asari sex toy, but only thing it has sex with is* **ENEMY SHIELDS!!!**  *AAAAAAAHAHAHAHAH!!!*

I told him he could do this writeup as long as he behaved himself, but he messed that up, so I'm taking over now.

Anywhoo, so uh . . . the Acolyte.

If you use the Heavy Barrel, it one-shots the shields of every non-boss, even on Platinum.

Use Disruptor or Phasic seems like overkill at that point, but it is *really* helpful when wearing down bosses.

The Power Magnifier is a must in the second mod slot.  Who doesn't like a burnier Flamer?

A nice thing about the Acolyte is that you can hold your charged shot and fire it off in the middle of a Flamer burst.  This comes in very handy if you are Flamering an enemy and suddenly a Phantom pops around a corner and gets in your face.  Your Flamethrower won't get her Barrier down before she wrecks your face and possibly impales you, but if you let go of that Acolyte shot, you can stun her and get your Flamer working on her health.

The build specifies a CSMG, but you can bring along any SMG you want in that place.  The only reason that sidearm there is because the AP barrel makes dealing with Guardians easier.

If you want to skip the SMG and just bring the Acolyte (or find yourself face-to-face with a Guardian and don't have time to swap weapons), Guardians require some tricks to deal with.  You can rebound a Acolyte ball off a wall or something and hit him in the back or skip a shot off the ground and hit his feet.  Another option is to fire off a carnage to stagger him and make him move the shield to the side.  Then Acolyte to the face.  That option isn't the most reliable, as Carnage only seems to give a good stagger about half the time.

-----

**Notes**

Like any other Vorcha build, you need **kills** to be effective.  Assists don't get your YAAAGH! up.  Without those precious Bloodlust stacks you are more squishy and your powers are less effective.  This can make playing Platinum problematic.  You won't do Harrier Ghost or Reegar GI DPS with this build and as such will probably find yourself getting too many assists and too few kills to be super-effective.

I *have* playtested this build on a Plat solo and it is **solid**.  It can handle the enemies well when there's no one else around to get the kills.

The Regen and large health pool make this build somewhat tanky, but it's somewhat situational.  You can deal with small arms fire well, but burst-firing heavy hitters like Atlases, Primes, Scions, Ravagers, and Praetorians *will* chew you up.  Your main counter to this is the great Vorcha dodge.

Use it often.

You have to stay ""deep in the red"" (2 - 3 stacks of Bloodlust) to keep your Regen at a high rate.  Watch out if you get downed and have to wait awhile for a teammate to rez you or after doing objectives, because you may have lost a stack or two of Bloodlust and find yourself to be a bit squishier than you thought you were.

Also, actively seek out Grab Kills.  They are a win-win-win.

You have a somewhat long grab kill animation.  You are also invulnerable for the duration of the animation, so this is a period where you 1) can't be killed, b) take some time to regen health, 3) kill an enemy and f) notch another elusive Grab Kill for grinding trophies.

Not the best build to use against Collectors.  If those damn bees get you, you're down to using an Acolyte and your Claws until they go away.

-----

**EDIT**

When I [originally specced this build](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/Vorcha/PONAR/Acolyte10BK5BP5//PistolRailAmp3/PowerAmplifierModule4/OmniCapacitors5/), I did so after erroneously calculating that putting 3 points into Carnage instead of 6 dropped the Fire Explosion damage from 1687 down to around 900.

After running through /u/corlist 's Combo Damage Formula (social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/14041340#14041340) again, I found that this only drops the damage from 1687 to 1384.

Since the drop in damage was not as severe as I originally believed, I took out the last 3 evos on Carnage and put them into the racial passive tree to pump up the damage you get from Flamer and Carnage (with the bonus power damage evos, you lose less than 100 damage from Carnage dropping from level 6 to 3).

As an extra bonus, the extra Capacity Bonus from Vorcha Resilience (4) allows you to bring along an SMG with the AP barrel to help deal with Guardians (the only somewhat problematic enemy with this build).

________________________________________________

On Engineers in particular, they focus on taking down one defense at a time. This makes them excellent kits for those who are new to this game and want to help out without requiring Counter Strike levels of aiming or 600 hr. level manifests.  Electrical powers are good against synthetic Health, Shields, and Barriers, fiery powers are good vs Armor and organic Health, and icy powers are good at debuffing targets. Tech Combos are also easy to pull off and tend to make up a good portion of Power Combos when more than one Tech user exists. Tech spam does nullify Biotic power though, so careful consideration should be taken in the presence of Biotics.

________________________________________

Talking about Adepts in particular, they have an interesting power balance on Platinum. On the one hand, they can be utterly impotent in the face of Tech and not deal enough upfront damage as weapon-focused Combat kits. On the other hand, they make great use of Warp Ammo to make their weapons extremely powerful (Warp Ammo IV + Lifted Target is quite OP with 120% of weapon damage on Health/Armor and 240% on Barriers) and Biotic Explosion combos are amongst the most powerful in the game. Typically Adepts are the core of a Biotic Death Squad, as they typically prime for Biotic Explosions that destroy both tight groups and bosses alike.

Keep the College post factual with minimal opinions. If you do state your opinion, make it extremely evident. Saying ""the Quarian Marksman is the worst Soldier in the game"" helps no one, but saying ""ED is not an preferred detonator because it only detonates in shields and synthetics"" is a statement that benefits all.

So here it is. Ladies and gentlemen, the Dream Team. It's got two designated primers and two designated detonators, with as much synergy between them as I could cram in. Here goes nothing.

**THE TEAM**

*The Primers*

* **Vorcha Sentinel**: Flamer is, quite simply, the single best tech primer in the game. You can talk about Snap Freeze all you want (and I'm going to next paragraph), this is where it's at. The cooldown is about one second long if you pulse it, and it blankets a gigantic area. The Vorcha Sentinel is the best class that has Flamer for this team, as it also has one of the best detonators in the game: Cluster Grenades. This means that if someone goes down, the Vorcha is the best candidate for going without a partner, as he can prime and detonate his own combos very fast and very effectively. His one weakness is that he is reliant on having access to an ammo box to resupply, but pairing him with someone who can detonate for him negates this. Spec him 5/6/6/5/4, or 6/6/6/4/4. Either one works fine, but a couple of evos are necessary. First, take reach on Flamer for better coverage. Second, take power damage and Regen on Bloodlust (obviously). Thirdly, take shrapnel and extra grenades on Clusters for more detonating. Other than that, it's up to you.

* **N7 Paladin**: You know it had to be here. No tech dream team is complete without this great Destroyer of Eardrums. He is the second primer on the team, and we want him specializing in Cryo Explosions. Basically, just spam Snap Freeze. Cryo explosions on him are bugged to do twice as much damage as they should. He's very flexible when speccing, but be sure to have 6 points in snap freeze, with reach for 4 and damage/weakness for 6, since the explosion evo is bugged.


*The Detonators*

* **Geth Engineer**: Again, you know it had to be here. The fastest Overload in the game and the Geth turret make for a fantastic combination. He's a detonator, so take the two chain evos on Overload and the Power Recharge on Hunter mode. Also take all of the Shield restoring specs on the turret, for reasons I'll explain in the strategy section.

* **N7 Slayer**: Some of you are asking ""I thought this was supposed to be a tech team."" The rest of you are thinking ""Of course."" Phase Disruptor is, quite simply, the best tech detonator in the game. It's incredibly fast with a huge area, and can be replenished with a charge. Anyone who has ever played a game with a Slayer on a tech team will tell you of the wonders of PD. Take Radius, Efficient Blast, and Shield damage on PD, and Barrier on Charge. Go full Defense for Fitness, and Power damage on the offensive passives.


**THE PAIRINGS**

You'll want to put the Slayer with the Vorcha, and the Gethgineer with the Paladin. Each of these pairings compliment each other fantastically, for reasons I'll explain here.

First of all, the Palagineer combo. Because of Hunter Mode, the Geth is very fragile. However, it can sit in the back spamming Chain Overload while the extremely tanky Paladin takes the brunt of the punishment. In addition, Snap Freeze affects a maximum of 3 targets at a time, which is also the number of targets hit by Chain Overload. Overload also means that enemy shields get stripped very quickly, opening them up for maximum damage from Cryo Explosions. The last awesome thing that Overload does is stun organic enemies, taking some heat off of the Paladin so he can do some more chilling. Furthermore, Hunter Mode lets the Geth let the Paladin know where the enemies are through walls so he can Snap Freeze them (voice chat is your friend). The icing on the cake, however, is the Geth Turret, not for this pairing, but for the next.

Now, the Slaycha. The fastest detonator and the fastest primer go together like hookers and blow. They'll each draw equal fire, since they both will be relatively up close, and they can both take it. They both have fantastic dodges, and the shield stripping ability of PD lets the Fire Explosions from Flamer truly shine. The main problem with this pairing is that they are going to have no shields for most of the game. PD drains barriers on use, and Vorchas have shields made of paper. However, if the Gethgineer can keep a turret near you two, this problem is mitigated. Since the Slayer can recharge by charging (which also detonates another explosion), the Vorcha should get the brunt of this benefit, letting Bloodlust recharge your health while the enemies work their way back through your shield gate, making you exponentially more survivable. The turret also gives you some situational awareness by letting you know where enemies are.


**NOTES/STRATEGY**

* **Vorcha**: What you want to do is pulse Flamer. This means turn it on for about 3-4 seconds (enough time for the Slayer to detonate and for you to lay some stacks on), turn it off, turn it on, turn it off, over and over again. Each ""cast"" of Flamer can only prime an enemy once, so leaving it on for the maximum duration doesn't add as much damage as pulsing does. The good thing for you is that you will get fuckloads of kills with your fire explosions and Flamer DOT, so Bloodlust should almost constantly be charged, meaning that your health will race up. Other than that, just remember to aim at the ground a bit in front of a group of enemies when throwing cluster grenades for the best coverage. Have fun orgasming over kills.

* **Paladin**: You're going to want to be as tanky as possible, so take full Fitness and Armoring from ED, and drain whenever possible to get the 40% reduced damage. When not Draining, your basic combo is Snap Freeze, then either duck into cover until the Gethgineer has detonated, or make your own damn cover, because you're a Paladin and don't give a shit. Only Incinerate (if you even spec into it) when the guy is already frozen/chilled, and only if you can't drain anyone. Also remember that even if you don't see the armor effect from ED (if you're off host), it's still on. Protecting the Gethgineer is your job, so if he goes down, reviving him is your priority. Snap Freeze anyone around him to clear the crowd a bit, then revive. Don't forget about your shield, as if you spec it for the fire effect, you can set up fire explosions for yourself if the Gethgineer ever goes down. Lastly, remember that Snap Freeze can detonate explosions too. This means that if you can get the guy that the Gethgineer started the chain at in the blast, it'll set off a Tech Burst, adding to your DPS.

* **Gethgineer**: Just keep Overloading, keep a turret near the other pair, and keep alive. This is probably the simplest of the four to play, but that doesn't mean the easiest. You're extremely fragile, so stay in cover, and move like hell if you get ambushed. Also, stay in communication with the Paladin, and let him know when enemies are inbound on his position. You'll do well to take a light sniper rifle like the Indra, since you're far enough away from the action that the explosions won't mess you up, and it goes well with your Overwatch role.

* **Slayer**: You're the least tanky of the frontline squad, and if you're stupid, the most likely to get synced. Use your dodge for all it's worth-- Charge and then *immediately* backflip into relative safety. You can get off 3 PD's before you need to charge again at most, less if you're taking fire. Each PD will only detonate one explosion, no matter how many primed enemies you hit, so don't be afraid to hit the same area multiple times. Also, remember that the ground is easier to hit than enemies-- aim at their feet. As fwooooooomp pointed out, the Scorpion is great on him, as staggers are your friend and will keep you both alive. Take ammo and ULM.

Test data can be found in [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JHZjbO-LxlyX7DBLuVP0dztRN2IayJVpdo-M-1fLiFE/edit) google doc.

Topic on BSN can be found here: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15123388

&gt;Summary

&gt;* The volus HM is hereafter known as a shell.
- The shell can be cancelled early by pressing the melee button.
- When the shell detonates, it will also do damage in the same radius.
- If the shell is cancelled early, the detonation will not inflict any damage.
- You are not able to deploy the shell while cloaked (light melee).
- The **approximate** duration of invulnerability for the shell is 0.9-1 seconds upon deployment. Sustaining the shell will not grant further invulnerability even upon new triggers.
- As long as the shell is sustained, the volus gains **approximately** 52.5% - 53.5% real/actual DR.
- Each trigger of the shell will regenerate 10% of the volus's max shields.
- Shield boost grants invulnerability for **approximately** 1.5s upon casting.
- The shell inflicts 100% (no bonus) damage to all defences except armour, which it does 75% damage to.
- The DR provided by the shell and shield boost can be stacked. This includes external sources and can actually stack beyond the listed 90% in the shield boost, despite shield boost being used.

This is a lot, especially if you don't like promoting in general (I hadn't promoted in around 2 months before Retaliation came). I'm a sucker for stuff like the new challenge system, so since the DLC came out I've started promoting again (well, 4 of the 6 classes. Keeping two at 20 for when friends want to play platinum).

Even so, at the rate I'm going I'll be long finished with all the other masteries before N7, so today I bulk bought some recruit packs for the xp cards, and thought I'd share the results for anyone else in the same situation. Everything that follows assumes you've maxed out all character customisations (I'm not sure how the common character cards work if you haven't)

Each recruit pack is 5k credits and you get exactly one character card in, worth either 12500 or 62500 experience. I spent 1.5m credits to buy 300 of these (this took around 50 minutes). The results were: 197 cards giving 62500xp, and 103 giving 12500xp. This suggests that you get these in a 2:1 ratio. (For a while it looked like it was going to be a 1:1 ratio. I'm not sure if this was because all my characters started off at low levels and that influences the chances, or just because of a smaller sample size).

Assuming a 2:1 ratio, you get 137500 per 3 recruit packs. It takes 2.5m experience for a full promotion (level 1-20); but as the cards drop evenly over all 6 classes, I'll look at how long it takes to get 15m experience.

15million/137500=109.09

Multiply that by three and you're looking at 328 (rounded up) recruit packs for a full cycle of promotions on all your characters. This would cost 1.64m and I would guess 65-70 minutes to buy them all. If you were to choose to get all 60 promotions this way, you would need around 16.4m credits.

Hope this was of some use to some people. If you go with this method I'd suggest doing it in batches of 328 packs at a time, as the buying gets somewhat boring (if I do it again I'll have a tv show playing on my laptop most likely).",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,PS3,True,t3_12d87g,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/12d87g/n7_mastery_and_recruit_packs/,

Thanks again to everyone for the feedback on the original concept.

First off, apologies if a similar/identical setup has already been posted, if it has, I didn't see it when I checked the backlog.

Okay, so this is a build I've been trying with the Human Soldier as an attempt to make him as Gold-viable as possible. I've had a pretty good amount of success with it the last few weeks on both FBWG farming and proper Gold matches, mostly against Cerberus.

The idea of this class is to emulate the bastard Geth Primes with their stunlock railguns. Everything is geared towards keeping those pesky Hunters and Phantoms stunned while you whittle away at their health.

Weapons loadout is Falcon (Extended Mags and Barrel) and GPS (Spare Ammo and Barrel). Yes I know, two heavy weapons, but hear me out. The Falcon is used for AoE crowd control on the mooks, with Cryo Ammo, while GPS is for when you need to take out big boss mobs. Both weapons stun your basic enemies which allows you to fire off a Concussive Shot and floor them, or shatter them if they're frozen. And all the while they're too busy getting stunned to fight back. It's relatively slow, but very safe, for taking out enemies, especially Phantoms. Basic strategy is to pop in and out of cover with Falcon shots at the ground and when their protection drops, alternate between shooting your weapon and Concussive Shot to knock them out. We all know how good the GPS is but I find it suffers when you get zerged, which is why the AoE CC from those mini-grenades is so important as a backup. And of course, Frags don't run off a cooldown so you can use them when waiting for AR or Concussive Shot to reset.

Basic build is 6-5-6-6-3. Used to be 6-5-3-6-6 but I respecced because of how juicy Frags are, and how useful it is to be able to carry four around at once.

**Adrenaline Rush** - Hardening, Duration, Shield Boost

This is basically your panic button when you need a free refill of your shields. Not much more to say, although it is pretty handy as functioning almost like a pseudo-Tactical Cloak when you charge up your GPS, allowing you to take out multiple Armor bars on Primes at once.

**Concussive Shot** - Radius, Shatter

I question the usefulness of both the Level 6 evolutions so I don't bother going past 5. That really gives you all you need. It's also why Cryo Ammo is the best choice to always roll this class with. Obviously, since this power isn't geared towards hitting hard, there's no point in going for the Force and Damage, so take the Impact Radius evolution instead. And cooldown's already short enough even with the weapon loadout so you don't need to take that. Concussive Shot is your ace in the hole, it gives you a third option for stunning enemies and allows you to deal with the mooks you froze with your Falcon really quickly. I believe with an Assault Rifle Rail Amp III it takes just two Falcon shots and then a Concussive Shot to kill your standard trooper unit, and all the while they won't be able to hit you back.

**Frag Grenade**

I'd say go all the way, taking Damage, Max Grenades and Armor-Piercing evolutions. The impact radius is already big enough so why not spec it for even more damage. With the power damage bonuses from Alliance Training you can get to somewhere around 1400 damage which is nothing to scoff at. And you can use them while in AR. Always good to have some Frags on hand to deal heavy damage. As for armor vs shields, honestly since shields are usually less strong than armor, I don't see the point of speccing into that. Plus, this makes your Frags more useful against Reapers (God forbid if you actually play this class against Gold Reapers).

**Alliance Training** - Damage and Capacity, Power Damage, Weapon Weight

Since your weapons are heavy as fuck, it's always a good idea to take as many capacity upgrades as possible so you can spam powers effectively. In my personal opinion, the weapon damage bonuses are negligible. Headshot damage modifiers are worthless on GPS, and I honestly always aim for the feet with the Falcon so I don't take advantage of that bonus. Best to give more power to your powers.

**Fitness**

You could arguably skip Fitness altogether and I wouldn't blame you for it. But since some of the other power evolutions are so worthless, might as well give you a couple extra hundred points of health. Even if it's just to give you a little feeling of extra security when you're staring down Primes. Or, if you're like me, who is very bad at staying in cover and hanging back. Call of Duty has ruined my playstyle, I'm just too aggressive for my own good.



************************************************************************************

So that's it. Feel free to critique, any ways I can improve this class would be much appreciated.

Can we trust his builds? He doesn't even have a maxed manifest he must be trash! Yes, yes I know, I don't have a maxed manifest but this is one of my favourite Infiltrator builds I use. Wait, how did he spell favorite? Stupid Canadian doesn't know how to spell basic words. 

So this is the Drell Assassin headshot build. No character can come close to the headshot damage this character can produce. The reason why,

* Drell Passives
* Tactical Cloak
* M-11 Suppressor 

Now the build we'll be using is a 4/4/6/6/6 utilizing all weapon aspects of the Drell Passives. Now what makes the Drell passives so good? Extra headshot damage, extra movement speed and extra weapon damage. Now lets go through the [build](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/DrellAssassin/FEPNR/MSuppressor10AZ5AI5/Locust10AW5AX5/TargetingVI3/AdrenalineModule3/VulnerabilityVI5/).

**Weapons** The guns we'll be using are the M-11 Suppressor and the M-12 Locust. 

**M-11 Suppressor** This gun has the highest headshot multiplier out of all the guns in the game making it the perfect headshot machine. It also has a decent clip size, a good fire rate and very little recoil. It's only downside, it runs out of ammo very quickly. Use cranial mod and magazine upgrade for more headshot damage and longer sustained fire

**M-12 Locust** To counter-act the low ammo supplies of the Suppressor, we will be using the Locust as a backup gun. Why the locust? It's light and is extremely accurate making landing headshots a breeze. Use heat sink/magazine upgrade and high caliber barrel. More damage and more ammo is always good. 

**Powers** Running a 4/4/6/6/6 build is what I personally like to run. It adds extra movement speed from fitness, extra damage from Drell Assassin and an amazing debuff from Recon mine. The only thing that could be changed based on personal preference is Tactical cloak and homing grenades.

**Tactical Cloak** I like to leave tactical cloak at 4 points, go for damage not duration! This build is about killing ennemies quickly with headshots so damage is your best choice.You don't need recharge speed or melee damage. As for rank 6 bonus power is not needed since using powers in the cloak cycle does not break cloak. As for Sniper damage, I don't see a sniper rifle in this build so it would be a waste. 

**Homing Grenades** I like to take 4 points into homing grenades just so if I run out of ammo on my Suppressor, I also have another damage dealer besides the locust. Rank 4 is personal preference. I like damage but you might like radius.

**Recon Mine** This is your debuffer so you can knock out enemies even faster. Go for radius Rank 4 so more enemies are effected. Rank 5 go for damage since you'll be firing this from cloak and recharge speed would not affect the outcome. And finally go for invasive scan to make recon mine a debuffer.

**Drell Assassin** All weapon damage! Especially headshots since it's an extra 30%.

**Fitness** All shields. Pretty basic we won't be doing any melee unless its a last resort and that extra movement speed is great for getting from spawn to spawn.

**Equipment** Most of equipment is personal preference and what you have at what level. **Ammo type**, Warp, Incendiary or Armor piercing. It doesn't really matter too much but extra damage from these is always good. **Weapon Amp** Targeting VI. Why? Headshots, headshots, headshots. **Passive Amp** This one really does not matter. You could use Cyclonic but Drell barriers suck. Shield Power Cells, it's alright. Adrenaline Mod, I personally prefer this just to make objects easier as an objective. But again, it's up to personal preference. **Gear** I only recommend two things, Vulnerability VI or Pistol Amp. We're focusing on the Suppressor and these are the two aspects the gun is good at, headshots and being a pistol. Two homing grenades is enough since we're not focusing on them so grenade capacity is unnecessary.

**Conclusion** The Drell headshot build can annihilate enemies leaving them in dust. With all your bonuses, your headshot damage comes out to be an amazing 135% bonus not including the Suppressor's base modifier. I recommend this class against all factions but it does excel against collectors since their heads or so massive.

1365547508.0,30,self.MECoOp,1c0ta0,Way of the Novaguard,33,3,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1c0ta0/way_of_the_novaguard/,"**Introduction**

The novaguard is a high risk, high reward character specializing in crowd control, front line tanking, AoE damage, and detonating power combos. The gameplay is extremely fast paced and very fun when done right.

Before continuing, it should be made clear that this guide doesn't have a ton of new information in regards to playing the class. [mrcle's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/10m7xn/guide_human_vanguard_novaguard/) and achire's guide (social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/14019942/) are two excellent resources I drew upon when learning how to play the class myself. Instead, I'm going to describe as many nuances as I can in my own way.

Lastly, I'm writing this guide from a PC player's perspective. Certain aspects such as canceling and shooting between abilities might not be feasible for console players, but hopefully there's enough helpful information otherwise.

**The Build**

[Half-Blast Nova](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Vanguard/Human/RAMPR/Talon4BK5AH5/Hurricane8AU5BB5/PistolRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator3/StrongholdPackage5/)

There are definitely other ways of playing the novaguard, including full blast nova (higher finesse) and claymore nova (more single target DPS). However, I've come to prefer this particular brand of novaguard  because:

* It has the highest throughput for combo detonations in the game. Period.

* The use of half-blast nova with good cooldowns is very forgiving. With the claymore nova build, you have to rely a lot more on canceling to survive

* I find the super high pace to be extremely fun and rewarding. Since you have so much more leeway with so many low CD invulnerability frames, you can take many more risks and still pull out of them fine. With shotgunguard and full blast, you have a lot less flexibility in what you can do.

None of the abilities or evolutions are really that debatable.

**Weapons and Equipment**

The Talon is best possible choice. Its got high burst, low weight, and also applies ammo powers often. Use it with the 40% damage barrel and AP mod for maximum effect. If the Talon can't be used, a Carnifex, Paladin, Executioner, Hornet, Piranha, or Scorpion are possible candidates, but each one just feels slightly worse in some way compared to the Talon.

Having a high level Hurricane with the AP mod and ULM is also a great way to cover some of the novaguard's weakness. For hack circles and dangerous bosses, it provides a way for the novaguard to engage enemies at range and should also remove any inclination to take 3 points into shockwave. However, it is recommended that this only be a complementary weapon to the Talon.

The power mods for weapons are decent choices if the player is looking for a little more AoE damage at a cost of single target DPS. Overall, cooldowns should not be any lower than 150%, but 180% or better is recommended. If you lack good lightweight weapons, the 20% reduction in weight in Alliance training is a good option.

Disruptor rounds are recommended for solo runs and teams that have a limited ability to set up combos (so you don't overlap the better combos) since they have a larger AoE, have a higher application rate, and act as additional CC. Otherwise, use either AP or warp ammo and replace the AP gun mods with damage or capacity ones.

Cyclonic is a straightforward choice since the novaguard is in close quarters so often. Stronghold package is great for gear since the reduced shield recharge time is good for getting back shields without charging and the extra shields are never a bad thing. The commando package is also a good choice if you're looking for more damage, but keep in mind that most enemies die within one power+shoot rotation. Responder package is good for solo runs.


**Techniques**

*Nova Canceling*

Nova canceling is one of the core components to effective novaguard play. On cast, nova grants 1.5s seconds of immunity from all sources of damage (except sync kills). However, the animation can be interrupted immediately with a dodge or melee, resulting in no damage dealt or barriers consumed, but still granting the full 1.5s of immunity.

The side roll is the best choice for canceling nova as it is fast and allows for a good displacement. Forward dodges aren't as great as they're slower, but they're better than back dodges as those are even slower and the player often has no idea of what they're rolling into. Light melee is good for carrying the pizza objective if sprinting it hasn't been mastered and also for standing stationary in a hack circle.

While nova canceling is incredibly potent, players should not get carried away with spamming it constantly as doing it in unnecessary situations results in reduced overall DPS and crowd control. Instead, canceling should generally be reserved for situations when charge is on cool down, the player is unable to kill or CC enemies in an area after a charge/nova combo, or there is incoming damage like an Atlas rocket.

*Firing between Powers*

This is a very useful technique that can contribute a significant amount to the novaguard's DPS. If a player holds down the trigger after activating an ability, the gun will fire immediately upon finishing the animation. The most difficult part is accurately aiming between powers. As showcased by [achire ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJv8oP4gzVs#t=3m6s), when done well it makes for almost seamless shooting between powers. Combined with the Talon's propensity to apply ammo powers, it can lead to rapidly chained combos with devastating effects.

*Reload Animation Hiding*

This technique refers to reloading a weapon during the animation of an ability, saving time. To do this, have only 1 shot in your weapon. Upon firing it, immediately use charge or nova and take no other action other than walking/running until the run has finished reloading (eg. nova canceling doesn't work).

*Moving During and After Powers*

This is more of a minor point, but still useful. During nova's full animation, the player can still move in any direction at roughly the speed of walking. This seemingly insignificantly amount of movement is useful for avoiding sync kills, CC, or slight repositioning for better nova placements. As for biotic charge, a player can hold down a direction so that they immediately move after completing the charge. For dangerous enemies that can stagger you like Primes, this is a useful tip for moving/rolling away immediately.

**Sync Kills**

These are the bane of novaguards considering they have to put themselves in melee range constantly. The key thing is knowing when an enemy can sync kill or not and setting rules for when it is safe. In general, it is never safe to be near an enemy after they have performed a basic melee attack. This can be problematic as these will stagger the player so it is imperative that you roll out as quickly as possible.

Banshees and Praetorians aren't safe to approach in general unless they're in the middle of their casting mode (warp/heavy melee for banshees, laser vision/missiles for praets).

Ramps and inclines are the great equalizer against sync killing enemies. However, some enemies like praetorians and brutes and just melee stun you to death if you aren't careful.

**Staggers**

*Staggers by enemies*

Getting staggered is the next worst thing to being sync killed as it means you become vulnerable to all sorts of things, including sync kills. As with sync kills, players need to learn to read enemies for when they're going stagger. Most basic enemies can stagger with just basic melee attacks so avoid staying in close range when nova or charge can't be used for whatever reason.

Occasionally, an enemy will attack you upon completion of a charge or during mid animation. This is incredibly dangerous as not only do you usually get staggered, but you also will lose barriers, leaving you with no charge or nova to survive. One of the most common enemies this can happen with is the Atlas when it fires its heavy rocket. Be sure to either stagger the atlas before it gets the shot off, avoid the missile before charging, or nova cancel tank it in place.

*Staggering against enemies*

During certain animations, enemies cannot be staggered by any means. This includes just about any melee animation or dodge and a few specific ones like a Dragoon's smash. This can be especially dangerous when approaching certain high threat enemies like abominations or phantoms which can then immediately retaliate. (Credit: corlist)

**Gameplay**

**You must host the match when playing a novaguard if you want to play properly.**  There are absolutely no exceptions to this rule. Luckily, novaguards are great classes for soloing at least the first 3 waves of any faction, meaning you can start empty lobbies by yourself and just let people trickle in. More on soloing later.

The core gameplay isn't too complicated. The standard combo is charge-&gt;shoot-&gt;nova-&gt;shoot-&gt;nova and repeat. Use nova canceling whenever you get into a situation that you aren't sure you'll survive; with experience, novaguards will be able to creep extremely close to the margin of death and come out leaving a pile of corpses with minimal need for cancels. To maximize effectiveness, just keep in the mind the ABCs of all vanguards, **A**lways **B**e **C**harging. Novaguards rely on constant movement to stay alive and deal damage. Regular rolls are also effective when nova is down.

Novaguards are best suited for taking out and drawing the attention of the regular mooks and letting their harder hitting team mates deal with bosses. Novaguards can engage up to groups four or five non-basic units effectively, but this is dependent on the composition of the group; take more caution approaching enemies with strong stagger capabilities and groups with two or more phantoms. It is usually best to isolate bosses when facing them so as to not get caught by asynchronous attack and/or stagger cycles.

When there's the presence of combo priming abilities, the novaguard shines as one of the fastest detonators in the game. The rapid combo of charge and two novas chained indefinitely is an incredibly potent detonating force. Paladin Sentinels, Reave users, and Collector adepts are some of the best partners for the novaguard for the sheer throughput on explosions.

Novaguards are great on all difficulties except for platinum, where they struggle a bit. This is due to the focus on bosses instead of regular enemies and also the reduced shield gate duration for players.

**Factions**

*Cerberus* 

Consisting mostly of CCable humanoid targets, Cerberus is a great faction for novguards to play against. Novaguards are one of the best anti-phantom classes as 1 charge and nova will drop their barriers and the second nova will rag doll them. Atlases are a pain for their ability to stagger you.

*Geth*

This is another great faction for novaguards due to the large number of humanoid targets. The key thing here is to stagger enemies before they can stagger you. Be careful when engaging primes as their melee will stagger you after a charge and their turrets can chain stun you to death. Engage enemies in more manageable groups and the geth are easy as they possess no sync kills.

*Reapers*

The Reapers are a step up from the previous two factions since there's a greater number of high resilience targets that are difficult to CC, namely brutes, ravagers, and banshees. Brutes are a huge pain to deal with as any of their moves will stagger and they can sync kill. Banshees are the more obvious threat so it is important to only ever charge a banshee when she is casting heavy melee or warp.

*Collectors*

The hardest faction for novaguards. The collectors also have two tanky units to be dealt with like the Reapers. Praetorians should almost never be approached unless they are casting and scions are annoyingly beefy. Above all this, getting hit by a single seeker swarm can spell death as you will have limited options for survivability. Novaguards should focus on killing abominations as they are worth a disproportionate amount of wave budget for their difficulty, but always be cautious of their staggering back blast and possessed detonation. 

**Soloing**

Novaguards are competent soloists. There are a few key things to keep in mind:

* Try to only engage groups that you can CC or kill
* When in doubt, nova cancel your way out of an engagement 
* Leave bosses for last unless lots of enemies are grouped around them. Setting off tech bursts around bosses is a good tactic
* Be extra cautious of staggers and synch kills. Learn the tells for these moves well.
* When doing the hack objective, simply nova cancel as much as possible and kill a few enemies to avoid getting completely swarmed. If a boss makes it into a hack area, lure it away and return to the circle
* For the pizza delivery, light melee nova canceling is great for walking the objective if you haven't mastered running the pizza

Novaguards have an easy time soloing the first 3 waves of every faction up to gold so don't be afraid to start empty lobbies; other people usually join within these first few waves. At waves 6+, it becomes much harder as there's a shift from lower enemies to bosses, which novaguards have more difficulty taking down, but it's entirely doable.

One of the nice things about soloing is there is a lot more control of the variables on the battlefield. Numbers of enemies can be better accounted for and there are no allies to prime an enemy's synch kill or bubble of denial.

**Video Demonstrations**

Novaguards are a difficult class to learn from just reading so I've included of my personal solos.

[FBWGG - 35:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWixKV-GGqE)

[FBGCG - 36:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siT6KkRlYSg)

There are a lot of sloppy points in these videos, but I do try apply the ideas and techniques described here. The idea is that you always want to be always be moving and using charge and nova and try to break groups of enemies into more manageable bunches. I wish I also had a teamplay video, but my laptop sucks at recording and I can't reliably find people to play with. In my personal experience, the more difficult parts about novaguard are learning the small mechanical nuances. For team play, it's simply getting into the mindset that you need to support your team and the gameplay should naturally follow with practice. 

I highly recommend [achire2k's solos](http://www.youtube.com/user/Achire2k?feature=watch). Watching his videos was what pushed me into the next level of novaguard play and he's got many of the mechanics extremely refined. Also has a pretty nice set of music tracks.

**Conclusion**

The vanguards of a military force are those who are on the leading edge, clearing out enemies for the rest of the force. True to that description, novaguards are excellent at taking out and corralling lesser enemies, detonating combo explosions, and just simply being badass.

Operation Aegis:

This is General Corinthus to all troops deployed in the Trebia System. 

Men, I'll be brief. The situation on Palaven is dire. Planet-Side combat is at a virtual standstill. Our forces, now reinforced with krogan battalions, are holding out, but aren't making strong headway against the Reapers. Our reinforcements are sparse, while the enemy is only getting stronger. 

Recently, Reapers landed fresh reinforcements on Menae. As commander of the forces on Menae, I know first hand how bad things are on the moon. I'm sure you've heard the N7s rather unflattering opinions of our Headquarters at Outpost Condor, but if that base falls, the defense of Menae is broken, and the moon is good as gone. And if Menae falls, the troops on Palaven lose even more support. To make matters worse, our Havoc, Ghost and Saboteur units are spread thin across the galaxy, many of which are unable to come home. It's up to the grunts on this one. 

Thankfully, I received some good news for a change. First, several Cabal units working elsewhere in the Apien Cest have been sent to reinforce our position. Second, I was recently contacted by a volus named Barla Von. Seems our little friends have been busy. Von has a organized a small battalion of volus troops, and managed to slip them right under the Reapers's noses on to Menae. They've already started digging in at Condor. They aren't the toughest in a firefight, but they're damn good support units. Needless to say, they can't do it without your help. So, I humbly command all turian forces in the immediate system to fall back to Menae. Our actions in this war will decide the fate of the turian people. Lets give the historians something good to write about. 

Corinthus out. 

Squad Objective: Extract on Firebase Condor on Gold or higher against Reaper forces using a Turian Soldier, Sentinel or Cabal kit.

Personally, I'd love to see the switch. It'd get people more involved in the ME universe which in my books is a very good thing. It'd also keep this game and community alive for a longer amount of time.

The question I'd like to ask is, what would it take for this to be possible? A decrease in of price for microtransactions? A slight increase of difficulty for freeloaders or perhaps just make the MP portion of ME3 buyable?

I'd like to hear your points for and against this, since it is quite an interesting topic.

Deciding which to include involved a little judgement - for example, I've excluded shadow strike but included phase disruptor, largely because phase disruptor won't give you a biotic kills medal (and defintely won't set off biotic combos). 

I'll assume you've read the in-game descriptions of the powers and already know roughly what they all do.

If you're intending to use these powers to set off combos with ammo, then read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/18os9u/can_you_help_me_piece_together_how_incendiary/c8gn7pv)

##Adrenaline Rush

Like marksman, this power instantly reloads your weapon. If you're using a weapon with long reload times (for example, the claymore or javelin) consider firing once, activating A-rush and firing again instantly. 

If you want to break a banshee sync kill and you have a heavy damage single-shot weapon like the claymore or javelin, firing once, using a thermal clip pack (which provides a 100% damage bonus), firing again and using adrenaline rush and firing a third time lets you take three shots within the space of about a second - two with a 100% bonus and one with 170%.

Some people using this build report success not taking evolution 3 (""Duration"") and say that it allows them to instantly reload more frequently because the benefit of activating adrenaline rush (instant reloads) occurs more often.

Unlike tactical cloak, this power only affects *weapon* damage, not power or melee damage (without the rank 5 upgrade). Your grenades *don't* get any benefit from being thrown while in A-rush. Evolution 6 (""Power Use"") therefore loses a bit of its lustre.

For the hardening evolution, you may want to find out how damage reduction works. Link is here: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15699700/

Evolution 5 (""Shield Boost"") restores 100% of your *base shields* (so 500 points of shielding). If you invest fully in the fitness tree, you'll have 825, but A-rush will still only restore 500 of them.

##Ballistic Blades

The mechanics of this power are still a little bit of a mystery, even after the 10 months that Resurgence has been out. We can gather a few details from the settings file though, and make some educated guesses about the rest. There's a fair amount of estimation in the following description of ballistic blades, so be warned.

The power shoots out a number of projectiles in a 90 degree cone, that reach 12m from the batarian. So you're firing a set number of projectiles out in a fan shape.

Each of these projectiles causes some amount of damage (possibly a fraction of the ballistic blades' 900+bonuses damage). More than one projectile can lodge into a target - we have a figure for maxprojectilesstuck in the settings file (set to three) and we can assume that the projectiles spread out from the batarian, meaning that fewer of them get lodged into targets at longer ranges ([here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1660040/bblades.png) is an adorably crude illustration of that point. The target far away has one blade lodged in it, the target close has two)

The projectiles cause some proportion of their damage immediately and the remainder as damage over time. My Batso has blades that cause 1417.5 damage, and can kill a husk at point blank range immediately. This implies that the immediate damage proportion is at least 65% (because husks have 928 health on gold), and indeed there is a figure in the settings file called 'instantdamagepercent' set to 0.8 (presumably meaning 80%). The remaining 20% of the damage is done over 10 seconds, or 15 seconds with evolution 5.

The impact of ballistic blades applies 800N of force, affects a maximum of 3 targets, and doesn't set off power combos. A nice perk of ballistic blades is that they will stop shield regeneration on bosses.

The explosion is an evolution much loved by skilled players. It applies 800N of force a second time, and does 400 base damage in a 0.5m radius. This double staggar is seen as quite useful on the batarian soldier, who cannot dodge and is therefore quite vulnerable to phantoms.

Much of the BSN believes that in rank 4 and 5, damage is a better choice than spread and reach a better choice than recharge. The opinion is that spread increases the spread of the projectiles without increasing their number, meaning that fewer projectiles get lodged into targets, and that the power therefore does less damage, and that reach is a way of ensuring your power does more damage at longer ranges.

##Carnage

The power applies 300N of force and will affect a maximum of 2 targets, whether or not you choose the radius evolution. 25% of the damage is delivered as DoT over 2 seconds. The power also sets up fire explosions for 3 seconds. The projectile travels at 20m/s.

The incapacitate evolution ragdolls a maximum of one target. The rank 6 armor damage evolution multiplies *total damage*.

##Concussive Shot

The power applies 300N of force and will ragdoll a maximum of one target. The power does quadruple damage to barriers, and the projectile travels at 30m/s.

The shredder evolution (evolution 6) does 200% of *total damage* to organic targets (link: social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/13855086/11#14968579). The DoT stacks. The shatter evolution (evolution 3) on frozen targets doubles base damage and doubles shredder's damage as well.

##Havoc Strike

Like submission net and cryo blast, havoc strike suffers from comparison to a power which provides much the same thing but with an extra added benefit (in this case, biotic charge, which refills your shields). However unlike biotic charge, havoc strike now allows you to choose the radius option (in rank 6 of strike and rank 4 of charge) and weapon damage bonuses in your passive, and still breach the 1000N threshhold necessary to staggar a gold or platinum phantom.

Strike gives you invulnerability frames. Although these don't protect against sync kills, they do provide a handy way to avoid taking damage from banshee warps and novas - [link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJR-XTza5E)

Havoc strike kills do give you tech medals. I'm still covering it here though, since it appears only on a soldier.

Like charge, strike gives you 50% damage reduction for 4 seconds after use. Also like charge, it applies 3x force to frozen targets (and unlike vanguards the soldier can exploit this without using cryo ammo). The power has a maximum range of 40m.

With the area bonus in rank 6, the power will affect a maximum of three targets (up from 1) and will still ragdoll no more than one target.

There's an interesting bug/exploit related to havoc strike allowing you to perform it without triggering a cooldown - social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/14645008. Use it at your own risk.

Finally, here is a thread from BSN user Feneckus that outlines his approach to havoc strike: social.bioware.com/forum/Mass-Effect-3/Mass-Effect-3-Multiplayer-Discussion-/Havoc-Soldier-video--guide--few-Claymore-tips-15750511-1.html

* The text can be anything you want, as long as it's not obscene or use weird fonts like Wingdings. My personal opinion is that the flair should be funny and/or relevant to you, but I can't make you do that.

* You also get a choice of color. AFAIK you get the standard RES colors to choose from.

Through extreme dedication, hard work and perseverance, the chosen few trained in Rio de Janeiro go from lethal combat specialists to unstoppable killing machines. 

 **Racial Passives and Traits**

Several of the N7 classes have Fitness and Passives perks that are unique to that particular character. The N7 Paladin Sentinel has Shield Mastery instead of fitness, which increases the amount of damage the shield can take before collapsing, and when maxed out, gains a level 6 combo primer. The Shadow Infiltrator learns Sword Mastery, which makes her melee attack do devastatingly high amounts of damage, and while most classes can take power damage increases, the Demolisher Engineer's passive traits increase grenade capacity. All the rest are standard Fitness/Passive trees. 

In terms of traits, the Shadow and Slayer Vanguard both carry a small sword for melee attacks (the Slayer is able to do a teleport sword lunge for his heavy melee), the Paladin carries an Omni-Shield, the Fury Adept and Slayer both have a unique teleport dodge that can actually allow you to jump through walls, which greatly helps evade or surprise enemies. The Demolisher and Paladin can do a standard combat role, the Devastator Soldier can do a sidestep (unless the Devastator has one of his powers activated, more on that later), and the Shadow can do an acrobatic dodge like the Drell

----

**N7 Destroyer Soldier**

This guy is pretty much a mech trooper. His TV-5 Battlesuit provides him with outrageous shield ([up to 3850 when specced right](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/?mobile#Soldier/NDestroyer/KAAAR////CyclonicModulator4/ShieldBooster5/)) and weapon damage bonuses, and his two sustained powers, *Hawk Missile Launcher* and *Devastator Mode* turn enemies into paste, with his *Multi-Frag Grenades* able to clear out enemy clusters with ease. 

* Devastator Mode is the Devastator's signature power, increasing, among others: damage, rate of fire, shields, shield recharge, fire rate and magazine size. When the damage options are all chosen in this and his Passives, he receives a +50% weapon damage bonus. The only downside is it slows movement speed and prevents combat dodging. It is a sustained power, meaning that it stays on until you turn it off. 

* the Hawk Missile Launcher is his second sustained power. When combined with Devastator Mode, it effectively turns him into a Main Battle Tank on legs. It fires a small shoulder-mounted missile every few seconds at any target you're locked on to. When the damage/force evolutions are chosen, it'll stagger most enemies on Platinum. 

* Multi-Frag Grenades are different than usual grenades. Rather than throwing a grenade like everyone else, the Devastator has a wrist-mounted launcher than will launch 3 or 5 grenades, depending on the evolution you choose. When 
Damage and force is chosen for every option, they carry a base force of 2300N, stronger than anything else in the game. I strongly suggest taking grenade count for level 6 though, as 5 grenades thrown at once makes taking out clustered groups of enemies a breeze. 

**N7 Fury Adept**

Nimble, agile, and when used correctly, *devastatingly* powerful. There's a reason she's known as a Biotic Explosion machine. Her 3 powers, *Annihilation Field, Dark Channel* and *Throw* combine together to bring about countless explosions all over the battlefield. 

* Annihilation Field is an extended-duration power that surrounds the Fury with biotic energy, damaging nearby enemies, priming them for BEs, potentially draining their health to replenish your shields, and if used again while still active, sends out a powerful biotic wave that will detonate BEs. 

* Dark Channel is a DoT power that primes targets for BEs, drains enemy health and 'infects' nearby targets upon death of the 'host'. What does this mean? Use DC on a target in a group, kill it, and DC jumps to a nearby target, priming that one. Kill that one, it jumps again. This makes clearing out groups very easy. 

* Throw is your standard biotic power. With a powerful BE boost evolution at level 5 and a very fast recharge time, this power is what changes the Fury from 'biotic with interesting powers' to 'biotic explosion machine'. Get close to an enemy wit AF running? Ka-boom. Primed a target in a group with DC? Multiple ka-booms in rapid succession. 

**N7 Shadow Infiltrator**

Another nimble warrior, the Shadow is the ninja of the MeCo-op world. With an astonishingly powerful melee attack ([over 4000!](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/?mobile#Infiltrator/NShadow/JAAAK/ATRaider1BG5AA1//StrengthEnhancer3//HydraulicJoints5/ ), quick dodges and invisibility, you can be in and out of enemy groups before they know what hit them, before you fall back onto your crowd control power, *Electric Slash*. 

* Tactical Cloak is the power common to all Infiltrators that grants invisibility for a short time (so they can infiltrate. Get it?), and a massive damage boost upon attacking while cloaked. With the Shadow, taking the melee damage and extra power evolutions at levels 5 and 6 respectively are advisable. 

* Electric Slash is a directional wave of electricity for taking out multiple enemies at once. It's a powerful attack that can go through walls and detonate Tech Combos; when combined with a Snap Freeze-happy Paladin, the Cryo Explosions don't stop. The only downside is it shakes the screen quite heavily, and the lengthy animation can sometimes get you in trouble. 

* Shadow Strike is, simply put, the most powerful power in the entire game. When activated, you teleport behind an enemy to slice through them with your sword. Because of this, it's counted as a melee attack, which is why it's so powerful; it benefits from both SS's evolutions *and* Sword Mastery, the Shadow's version of fitness. When melee damage is maxed on everything, the base damage for SS is 1,890 damage. When gear is applied and you use the power while cloaked, you can hit for over [3,000 damage.](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/?mobile#Infiltrator/NShadow/JAKIK/ATRaider1BG5AA1//StrengthEnhancer3//HydraulicJoints5/)

**N7 Paladin Sentinel**

I hope you like the sound of breaking glass. The Paladin is the combo-lover's wet dream come true. He carries three offensive powers, *Snap Freeze, Incinerate* and *Shield Drain*, all of which prime for tech combos, and all of which detonate tech combos. His signature Omni-Shield can also be deployed for momentary cover, and used to shield bash. 

* Snap Freeze is a blast of super-cooled air that, well, snap freezes unshielded and unarmoured enemies, slows and debuffs shielded/armoured enemies and primes for Cryo Explosions. Due to a bug, all CEs primed by SF do 2x as much damage as they should. They also have a decent blast radius, so if you've frozen a target and then set off the CE with another target nearby, that target will also cop the explosion. Snap Freeze can also penetrate walls, so a decent idea is to use it every time you go around a corner. If you see an ice cube lying on the floor, a quick dose of Incinerate will clear that mess right up. Note: the level 6 evolution, Tech Combo, is bugged and doesn't work. Take Damage &amp; weakness instead. 

* Incinerate launches a flaming projectile that set enemies on fire and detonated most TCs. Powerful against armour, it also applies a burning DoT effect on targets, and sets enemies up for Fire Explosions

* Shield Drain is an instantaneous-effect attack that drains shields and damages synthetics to restore your own shields. Against most factions, this power doesn't get used often, as a target with only health will only be staggered, and armoured targets are immune. Neither will recharge your shields. Against the Geth however, you're practically unstoppable. Every single enemy can be drained for shield recharge. It works much better if Incinerate or SF is used first, as not only will you get a shield boost, but you'll also get the TE. 

* Omni-Shield is the Paladin's melee weapon and portable cover device. When propped up to take enemy fire, you serve as a distraction, making you useful when your friend is hacking an objective, and mooks will also close in without doing damage, allowing for you to use SF when they're not expecting it. When the level 6 evolution is reached, you have the option of turning your shield into a Cryo or Fire shield, which turns your heavy melee into a level 6 primer.  

**N7 Demolisher Engineer**

The Demolisher is the grenadiest grenadier that ever grenaded. If you take every grenade capacity evolution and equip the Grenade Capacity V gear, you can carry 13 grenades into battle, and her Supply Pylon replenishes them constantly. 

* Supply Pylon is a deployable ammo box and shield booster. When standing in the radius, you and your team receive a considerable shield boost. It also constantly spits out ammo and grenades, allowing you to restock every few seconds, which comes in very handy with the amount of grenades you're going to be throwing. 

* Arc Grenades are EMP grenades with a massive radius that shock enemies into momentary paralysis and are devastating against shields and barriers. They're also fast-acting, so they're very effective when surrounded; just lob one on the floor and they blow up almost instantly. 

* Homing Grenades are large, slow-moving projectiles that can easily do over 1,000 damage. They can be evolved to do fire DoT, allowing for Fire Explosions. Because they move slowly but do lots of damage, these are best used on stronger, armour-clad enemies.

1354682951.0,31,self.MECoOp,14b1ek,[GUIDE] How to change your FOV (PC only. Sorry console owners.),39,8,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/14b1ek/guide_how_to_change_your_fov_pc_only_sorry/,"For the lazy, download [this.](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11679561/Coalesced.bin) It's at 100 FOV. Just back up your original coalesced.bin and put it in the folder Mass Effect 3\BIOGame\CookedPCConsole. 

***THIS INVOLVES EDITING COALESCED.BIN. DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.***

Hey everyone. As many of you know, most PC games have an FOV slider or option that lets you increase or decrease your FOV as you see fit. Unfortunately, Mass Effect 3 does not. Your FOV is locked at 70 and to some, this feels claustrophobic and causes motion sickness.

Fear not my friends, for I have found an [ancient relic of knowledge](http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/11623246) in the depths of the Bioware forums. You can indeed increase or decrease your FOV. However, this requires adjustments in coalesed.bin deep within the Mass Effect 3 files directory. Don't worry about reading the thread to find out how to do it: I made a guide for you. I'll just note that I didn't figure this out. I merely discovered it while googling.

Proof for those who demand it: [SP Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQYxo3ec78c), [MP Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzCGlR5o6Ac), [Pic](http://www.myimg.us/images/03.05.12/24603.jpg), and why would I make this guide and waste my time if it was impossible?

*While so far no one seems to have been banned from using this FOV adjustment, it's still treading on grey area. Also, editing without backing up coalesced.bin may result in gamebreaking effects which can be repaired with a reinstallation (we will go over how to back it up in the guide). Do this at your own risk.*

**Steps on how to change your FOV yourself:**

1. [Download this nifty program](http://wenchy.net/me3-coalesced-utility/). It will allow you to modify coalesced.bin.

2. Extract it anywhere you wish.

3. Navigate to your Mass Effect 3 directory, then open BIOGame, then CookedPCConsole. For me it's at *C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Mass Effect 3\BIOGame\CookedPCConsole*. You should have something pretty similar.

4. Make a back up of *coalesced.bin*. Just copy paste *coalesced.bin* with a different name.

5. Open *ME3Coalesced.exe*

6. Click File, then Open. For those with poor computer skills, it looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ORlyS.png).

7. Go to your CookedPCConsole folder and open *coalesced.bin*.

8. After it loads, open bioinput.ini tree, then sfxgame, then sfxgamemodebase. Click on bindings = (multiple).

9. Scroll down the right side of the program until you get to the very bottom with an open space with an asterisk (* &lt;- this guy) on the left side. [It should look like this.](http://i.imgur.com/KGig3.png)

10. Click on the open space, then copy and paste this guy in: 
**( Name=""Shared_Aim"", Command=""SwapWeaponIfEmpty | TightAim | FOV 0 | OnRelease FOV 90 | OnRelease StopTightAim"" )**

11. Change the ""90"" in that line to the desired FOV. I use 100. Press enter. [Now it should look something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/uOCQf.png)

12. Click File, Save. And you're done!

13. If the game stops behaving in a normal manner, such as being unable to move or fire in game, remove/delete *coalesced.bin* and restore the backup by renaming it to *coalesced.bin*.

**What to do when in game:** Right click (zoom) once. Now you're in a different FOV!

**FAQ**

1. **Will I get banned for using this?** *For the last time, probably not. So far Bioware has not banned anyone using this adjustment. While higher FOV does give you an advantage in combat by letting you see more, it's not a huge difference that it warrants a ban. It can change, but it's highly unlikely.*

2. **Will it affect multiplayer matchmaking?** *Nope. I have read comments that say that no one can enter the lobby when they're the host, but I have not had that problem. People entered my game at the same frequency as before.*

3. **I messed up and now the game wont work.** *As I said before: restore your backup. If you don't have a backup, reinstall. If problems persist after reinstallation, it's not the coalesced.bin.*

He was using a Harrier, and with the right spec and mods it can be quite deadly.

We finished the round in about 18 minutes, and when I got to see the end game score board I got quite a shock. i had earned about 450K XP and 30 MILLION! credits. The host left the game before I could get a screenshot, and unfortunately I can't remember the names so I have no way of reporting him.  

My question is what do I do now? With this much money the entire game is ruined for me, maxing out my manifest has been a fun challenge, and something I've been working towards for a long time. is there any way I can get someone at Bioware to remove those credits? Can I get into any trouble?

So, for example, if you use Charge on an enemy and then finish them off with a blast from your Claymore, the points for that kill will go towards your Charge challenge, as well as the Claymore use challenge (if it's currently incomplete).

So when you're working on, say, the Combat Drone challenge, don't waste your time trying to let the drone get the kills. Best advice would be to spec it however would result in hitting the most enemies, not necessarily the most damage, so that you maximize the portion of your  points that credit the Drone challenge.

If you want to know how I know this - well, someone told me. I verified it today by starting a private match with a low level vanguard. I Charged a few enemies (and my charge was not even close to OHKO'ing them) and finished them off with a weapon. After a couple enemies, I let my character die. Back on the challenges screen, my Charge challenge had moved from 0 points to 600+ change.

I haven't tried this in any other form, so I guess there could be some weapons/powers/situations where this doesn't apply, but I haven't heard of any exceptions.

tl;dr Your weapon/power doesn't have to deal the killing blow to get credit towards that weapon's/power's challenge.

-edit-

With further testing, I can say for certain that the points awarded are based on the XP given by enemies. Additionally, random location/enemy XP bonuses WILL give extra points towards challenges. The 5% galactic readiness boost does not, however, grant extra points towards challenges. And finally, I can confirm that the amount of points given to each power/weapon is based on the percentage of damage done to each enemy by each power/weapon. That is, partial credit is given to all powers/weapons used on each enemy.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1351898113.0,,Xbox,True,t3_12j0uk,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/12j0uk/a_tip_for_completing_challenges_that_some_may_not/,

Then again, considering they recently overhauled the whole co-op experience, they may have long term plans to support multiplayer even beyond the Retaliation character releases.  

Either way, I’ve been thinking of possible maps they could add.  The list I’ve come up with is a tribute to the whole trilogy, with two maps from each game.  No, they don’t entirely make sense; why would you be fighting Cerberus on Ilos?  Then again, you’re already fighting the Geth in Vancouver, so lore means next to nothing in these cases.

Here’s my list:

* Firebase Sky – Feros from ME1, based on either the Skyway or Zhu’s Hope

* Firebase Relic – Ilos from ME1, based on the Ilos ruins

* Firebase Horizon – Horizon from ME2, based on the area where you fight the Praetorian

* Firebase Omega – Omega from ME2, based on Garrus or Mordin recruitment mission locations

* Firebase Exodus – Rannoch from ME3, based on the AA Towers mission

* Firebase Heretic – Geth platform, based on Heretic Station from ME2 or Geth ~~Juggernaut~~ Dreadnought from ME3

The eagle wrecks mooks.  Like, wrecks them.  Makes them look foolish.  For anything with a shield, just incinerate them.  They stagger, you unload on their faces with the eagle.  The combat drone explosion does 908 damage.  The rockets it shoots do 681 damage.  If it's not destroying unshielded enemies or husks or swarmers, it's a fucking assist machine.  The locust is stupid and should die.

I find the best way to play this is just hang back, launch incinerate at anything that moves, and just keep the trigger down.  The eagle has a huge clip with the magazine upgrade.  And don't forget to keep your drone up at all times.  Also, it can be a male engineer, if that's what your into.  I don't mind.  Free love and peace man.

But, after realizing I was missing out on too much of the game by not using them, I decided to learn them.  Here are some basic tips, and they're intended for less experienced players, or people who have been avoiding snipers.

* *Practice in single player.*  After I unlocked the BW I at N7 50 (I know, lucky), I tried it out on bronze and was a complete mess.  Humiliated by this performance, I put myself through boot camp by doing a completely fresh Infiltrator campaign on Insanity.  The first couple missions were agonizing, but damned if I didn't learn to stay in cover.

* *Transition with hybrid guns.*  If you're more comfortable with assault rifles, try using the Raptor, or the Indra if you have it.  The 4x zoom on most snipers can be a little jarring, so the 2x on these guns will help you start to get a better feel for the zoom mechanic.  You can also throw a 2x scope on a pistol like the Carnifex to get a feel for a higher damage, lower rate of fire weapon.

* *Take your time.*  If you've been accustomed to spamming ARs and running around like a mad man, let the game slow down a bit.  If you're playing an infiltrator, cloak gives you some time to breathe before taking a shot.  Try to pick someone stationary (or at least moving parallel to your line of sight), line up the shot, and take it.  Don't worry about headshots until you are reliably hitting enemies with a high degree of accuracy.  It may feel like you aren't killing people fast enough, but eventually you'll be surprised how efficiently you're killing.

* *Start with multi-shot snipers, if you have them.*  The Valiant would probably be the best option, as its low recoil and three shots make it very forgiving.  The BW would be the second best option here, but not everyone has these weapons.  Barring those guns, the Mantis is solid, as is the Widow if you have it.

* *Don't get tunnel vision.*  When you're frequently looking at one small region of the map through the scope, it's easy to forget about everything else happening around you.  Keep checking other areas of the map and your teammates to maintain your situational awareness.

* *Learn to reload cancel.*  Most people on this board know how to do this, and it's been posted here many times, but given this is a basic tips guide, I'm putting it here again.  When you reload, as soon as the red ammo bar in the lower left fills, you've got it.  At this moment, you can cancel the rest of the character reload animation (maybe 30-40% of the total reload time?) by performing some other action, like cloak, run, dodge, medigel, etc.

Searching for sniper tips (specifically reload cancel) is what originally brought me to this site.  Hopefully these help a few of you.

**EDIT:** Had assumed the Widow had a longer reload time than the Mantis, which is not the case, so edited to reflect that.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1339061175.0,,PS3,True,t3_up3le,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/up3le/basic_tips_for_folks_trying_to_learn_sniper_rifles/,

1373640303.0,32,self.MECoOp,1i5lcq,Ultimate Class of the Week - The Vanilla Human Soldiers by RepublicanShredder,35,3,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1i5lcq/ultimate_class_of_the_week_the_vanilla_human/,"As our arsenal expands, we always want to try out our new toys against the bad guys. Turians, Vorcha, Geth, Quarian, Batarians, and even Krogan all give us a different experiences to fine tune and improve our playing style. Few realize that the best of our arsenal has been with us all along- the Vanilla Human Kits.

With the other Soldiers, what makes the Vanilla Human Soldier so special? Almost every other Soldier has more Shields than the Vanilla Human and many are capable of extreme carnage. The Krogan Soldier can create his own Fire Explosions on demand, the Geth Soldier can unleash a Flamer of unparallelled magnitude, the Batarian can control mooks and bosses alike without relenting, and the Vanilla Turian is capable of magnifying the effectiveness of fully automatic weapons. How can the Vanilla Human Soldier compete with the likes of these?

The answer is simple: the Vanilla Human Soldier is flexible and well rounded. In between reasonable defenses, attacks, and utility moves, there isn't a challenge a Vanilla Human Soldier can't take. All three powers (Adrenaline Rush, Concussive Shot, Frag Grenades) are great and should never be skipped unless under the most dire of circumstances.

While not directly capable of having heavy shielding, this is made up with the Human roll-dodge and Adrenaline Rush. The roll-dodge is a quick maneuver that is the best dodge in the game, allowing a quick Soldier to dodge enemy attacks and reposition themselves for a counter-attack. If that wasn't enough, Adrenaline Rush can allow the Human Soldier to do some limited tanking. Rank 4 Hardening gives 40% damage reduction while Rank 6 Shield Boost restores and adds 500 temporary Shield points in case of emergencies. Both of those give the Vanilla Human Soldier enough tools to deflect most hits.
Attack-wise, the Vanilla Human Soldier does have a few tricks up its sleeve. The first is Adrenaline Rush. That power allows for instant reloading of a weapon, granting enormous firepower in a short time-span that particularly affects small magazine weapons like the Claymore, Javelin, Saber, and Paladin. That isn't to say that weapons with larger magazines like the Typhoon (which can be infinitely chained with Adrenaline Rush) and the Hurricane don't benefit from it as well. The ""second"" magazine also gets a damage boost, making such burst attacks even stronger than usual. Second, both Concussive Shot and Frag Grenades can detonate Tech Combos. This makes the Vanilla Human Soldier a great complement to Tech-heavy teams as there will always be a detonator ready when this kit is on the field. Of particular note, Concussive Shot is the fastest Tech Detonator in the game (that doesn't depend on Barriers, Phase Disruptor) that also possess decent force and homing ability. This makes it perfect against low level enemies to line them up for further damage, either by staggering them or forcing them into a new position. With the Shredder evolution, Concussive Shot can deal DoT to organics, making it potent against 3 of the 4 current factions. Add the 4x Barrier damage multiplier and you have a nice power that is perfect against the most troublesome of enemies. Frag Grenades just plain and simple hit hard with a good radius, making it great in slowing down groups of enemies. Those grenades can even stagger bosses under the right conditions, perfectly complementing Concussive Shot's anti-minion ability.

On the utility side, all three powers have non-direct utility. As mentioned, Adrenaline Rush can Shield Boost to deflect attacks and give the Vanilla Human Soldier enough breathing room to finish off an enemy. Concussive Shot, also mentioned previously, is perfect for lining up an enemy into the crosshairs of a powerful weapon. This makes said weapon much more powerful as headshots usually results in a dead enemy. The homing ability can even hit around corners, sending enemies flying out of cover. Frag Grenades have a small proximity fuse along with an excellent trajectory arc that makes it easy to hit enemies behind cover and around corners. With enough practice, no enemy can escape the wrath of a Vanilla Human Soldier.

So there you have it, the Vanilla Human Soldier. When weapons start becoming more and more advanced, the Vanilla Human Soldier can take advantage of it by amplifying its effectiveness against mooks with Concussive Shot and bosses with Adrenaline Rush. Not the flashiest kit nor the most advanced but with a solid skillset and passives that few kits across the entire game can rival, the Vanilla Human Soldier should never be underestimated.",[Class Discussion],False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,Spectre,True,t3_1i5lcq,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1i5lcq/ultimate_class_of_the_week_the_vanilla_human/,moderator

The builds listed will be built around my playstyle and should not be followed blindly. To help compensate for that, I will provide alternatives that will hopefully provide enough breadth so that you can find your niche with each kit.

Infiltrators are my favorite class. The majority of my singleplayer playthroughs were with Infiltrators and I can always count on an Infiltrator to help me carry a team. I only enjoy playing a few Infiltrators, but those few are kits I'm never tired of playing. Most players use Tactical Cloak (TC) as a pure damage booster, but don't forget that TC is also an invisibility cloak to conceal your movement. Cyonan from BSN has a relevant article on how TC works within the game mechanics (social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15566247/1).

Each kit will have it's own comment inside this one and will follow this format. Any relevant posts will be hyperlinked in.

**Kit [Name](build link) [Ammo]** - A brief list of how the kit is setup.

**Build Goals**- a short description of how the build operates

**Why Weapon X**- weapon choice is as important as kit choice and thus deserves its own section.

**Minor Alterations**- Sometimes you just need minor alterations to a build to make it better for certain users.

**Ease of Use-** A rough estimate on how much margin of error you have when using it. Easier to use kits will have more room for mistakes than those that kits that are harder to use.

**Platinum Strength**- Most kits do fine on Gold- difficulties, but the boss rush on Platinum is a whole different level. This is related to Ease of Use, but the two aren't that integrated. For example, a low health/high DPS kit will be hard to use but have excellent Platinum strength.

**Alternative Builds**- Many kits will have other good builds to choose from and will be discussed here.

_______________________________________________

On Infiltrators in particular, they embody one philosophy: wear down the enemy and kill them with a damage spike. Infiltrators have some of the best kits in the game because of the intense damage spike they can deal in Tactical Cloak. The difference between a decent Infiltrator and a great Infiltrator is how they use Tactical Cloak. Decent players use Tactical Cloak for its damage boost. Great players use Tactical Cloak for improved mobility along with the damage boost. Because of that mobility boost, Infiltrators also make for great team medics to revive allies nearly undetected.

Does that mean the class is no fun?  Hell no!  Enter: the Cain Tripmine.  This motherfucker deals obscene damage (This build dealt about half hp to a brute per mine, without any damage-increasing gear/equipment, and can one-shot phantoms with very little extra), and you can throw them all day thanks to the grenade-increasing abilities of the assorted arrows.

You don't need your bow to do anything except the occasional stun.  Survivability is the name of the game, here.

**Weapons:** Your favorite guns.  Weight doesn't matter, go apeshit.  I haven't used the same guns twice.  You'd be surprised how well all bullets synergize with big explosions.  

**Gear:** Either your grenade mod of choice, or power damage+.  

I know it sounds like we're ignoring all of his powers but one here, but it's actually a ton of fun.  Trying to figure out the optimal location for grenades, the occasional close call averted due to a concussive shot, it's all a good time.  Let me know what you think.

I haven't posted a build in a while, so here you go. This is the Shadow build I use. Its not going to be a cledio_ify1 novel, just a short guide. 

So what you are going to do is go and build [this](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/NShadow/MDKIL/Hurricane10AU5BB5/Wraith10AP5BG5/StrengthEnhancer3/PowerEfficiencyModule4/OmniCapacitors5/).

The Wraith is interchangeable depending on the enemy. Against Cerberus I like the Scorpion to deal with Phantoms and against Geth I like the Reegar. Reapers or Collectors I will take the Wraith though. You really just want a hard hitting weapon for times you are uncloaked (Which in this build, you pretty much always will be). 

So the playstyle. Its pretty simple, but it takes a good player to master it. As a gold player myself, having 650 heath and shields means I will be extremely vulnerable if I am not hidden. This is how you are going to play. You are an assassin. Not a soldier. 

Tactical cloak, shadow strike, run out of sight. Thats going to be the basis of this class. I often like shadow striking a second enemy while im cloaked, but just make sure that enemy is isolated from a group. The wraith is there to make sure he is dead after striking him. Heavy melee also works. Tactical cloak is evolved so you don't de-cloak after your first strike, and also for duration so it leaves ample time to run away. Running away is something you will be doing a lot. You will also want to be cloaked for the majority of the time aswell. 

When you find a fatlas, or geth primes, switch to your Hurricane. I like using Disruptor ammo for just stripping shields, or Warp ammo. Incendiary works well too. When the shields are gone, I like meleeing the crap out of them just because its satisfying. **Disclaimer, I am not responsible for your crushed skull when an atlas has enough of being stabbed*.

Electric Slash is my GTFO assistant. If I find myself surrounded by mooks, ill just stagger them all and run with ES. 

I cannot stress enough: **Do not play aggressively with this class!**. When you get to the later waves, you will die a lot if you go into rambo mode. I have personally soloed a gold wave 10 with this (delivering both pizzas), and i took a good 5 minutes clearing the wave after completing the objective. Take your time. Isolate enemies and hit them when they are least expecting it. 

Ill happily answer any questions in the comments if you have them. Thanks for your time.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,False,,,True,t3_17v7lt,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/17v7lt/salsadips_guide_to_assassination_or_how_to_n7/,
1358143526.0,32,self.MECoOp,16jdfj,MeCo-Op College - Races 108: Geth,40,8,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16jdfj/mecoop_college_races_108_geth/,"The Geth are a race of humanoid robots, operating under a networked artificial intelligence system. Every single Geth platform is designed to be fully functional for battle, and they are designed very well. 

**Racial Passives and Traits**

The Geth are known for their strong shields over relatively poor health, with the Engineer and Infiltrator having 250/750 as base health/shields, and the Trooper having 250/1000 as base. Each Geth class, (Soldier, Engineer and Infiltrator) carry the same Passives and Fitness. They're the same as the rest of most species', but all Geth have reduced AR and SR weight as a level 6 evolution in Passives, and they also come with a Geth weapon damage bonus, increasing the damage output of the Geth Plasma SMG, Geth Plasma Shotgun, Geth Pulse Rifle and the Javelin Sniper Rifle. 

The Geth heavy melee is unique; it is the fastest in the game and is able to be  either sustained or used repetitively very quickly, but at a cost: it drains your shields every time you activate it, and if you sustain it, it drains them quite rapidly. Holding it will send out an electric shock to nearby enemies, with each pulse draining your shields a bit. 

Each Geth also comes with *Hunter Mode*. It is a sustained power that increases all forms of damage, movement speed, accuracy, and can be evolved to increase power damage, recharge speed, and rate of fire. It also grants you partial X-ray vision, allowing you to see through smoke and walls. The downside is that when active, it reduces your shields by half, and the screen becomes 'computerised', making some things like objective markers difficult to see. 

**Geth Trooper Soldier**

The Geth Trooper is one of the most powerful close quarter combatants in the game. His two sustained powers, *Hunter Mode* and *Fortifcation* both serve to boost his activated power, *Flamer*, making him very deadly against hordes of enemies. 

* Flamer is a short-range flamethrower that is devastatingly powerful against health and armour. Not only does it kill enemies very quickly, it paralyses enemies stripped down to health, and does burning damage over time, allowing for others to detonate a Fire Explosion. With the right evolutions, combined with his other two powers, the Trooper's Flamer is the strongest in the game. 

* Fortification reduces damage taken, increases power damage, and, when purged, increases melee damage a significant amount. Taking power synergy at rank 5 is practically required, as it ramps up your Flamer damage output. 

**Geth Engineer**

Being that they're a race of machines, it's no surprise that the Geth know how to operate them very well. With *Overload, Hunter Mode* and *Geth Turret*, this platform greatly accentuates a team, helping to suppress, spot targets and strip shields. 

* Geth Turret is a small floating platform deployed by the Engineer that will lay down fire on any enemy in its line of sight, and restores the shields of any ally writhing range. At level 6, it gains the ability to equip a powerful close-range flamethrower. 

* Overload is a tech power that is best used against shields, but can be evolved to inflict neural damage to incapacitate organic enemies. Specced properly, the Gethgineer's Overload is the strongest in the game, able to do up to and over 3,000 damage against shields and barriers. 

**Geth Infiltrator**

This guy is the ultimate sniper. With the right evolutions and equipment, he is able to put out the highest damage per shot of any character in the entire game. With *Tactical Cloak, Hunter Mode* and *Proximity Mine*, enemies will not survive long. 

* Tactical Cloak is the standard Infiltrator power, which is extremely useful when playing as a sniper. Simply cloak and shoot for a massive damage bonus. With only a sniper rifle equipped, it's recharge speed becomes considerably fast, allowing you to damage boost many of your shots 

* Proximity Mine is a mine that will explode when an enemy comes within its radius. Quite powerful, but its main use is as an armour debuffer; at rank 5 it gains the option to increase all damage taken by the enemy by 20% for 8 seconds, allowing your sniper bullets to do much more damage.

2. Worst new expansion class: Turian Saboteur. Poor guy has horrible power synergy and his defining ability had been nerfed WAY too hard.

4. Most inspiring loadout you've seen in the lobby: Batarian Soldier with a Talon. I'll never give it up. The first guy I saw play it was like Kurt Russell in Tombstone during the montage.

5. Most WTF? nerf: Vindicator nerf made NO sense. It was good but hardly overpowered.

6. Best buff: Acolyte charge removal was nuts. A great gun moved up to God Tier for a short period. Changed the game for a bunch of classes. Honorable mention: Singularity. HA is a new class.

7. Worst Nerf: Smash. It really took an awesome class down too many pegs. The Ex-Cerbs aren't unplayable, but they were powerhouses IMO. The Smashguard was a beast.

10. Highest MP moments?: My first round with the Huntress was pretty epic...scored 120k, never went down and thoroughly enjoyed every second of the round. Raider X, Warp IV, Cyclonic II, Shottie Amp. 

11. Lowest MP moments?: Too many to name. Every time I try to Drellguard is a tragedy. I rage missile Turrets, Collector Captains, Phantom/Dragoon clusters, and other annoying things randomly. My first round against Geth on my Huntress. I didn't have an Acolyte and well..yeah..she was pretty ordinary.

12. Best Weapon discovery due to a post in this Reddit: CSR X. I ignored this thing after the first time out..man was I wrong about it. Burst firing this thing is just insane and it goes so well with a variety of builds. 

11. Favorite New build thanks to this Reddit: BF3 God of Hellfire. I like a lot of builds, but this one took a guy I never even assigned points for most of the time and made him part of the regular rotation. I alternate between the Reegar and Talon, but it's very fun and quite powerful. Honorable mention is the ThrowSlinger build, because it really sped up my HS play.

Thanks for a fun year all, and welcome new folks! Looking forward to sticking around through ME4!

1356360769.0,27,self.MECoOp,15dioc,Fixing biotic/tech dissonance,37,10,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/15dioc/fixing_biotictech_dissonance/,"Probably my least favorite thing about this game and something I'm sure anyone who enjoys playing biotics knows is that having tech-based teammates severely hampers your ability to be effective. If you join a pub as asari adept and have teammates playing N7 paladin, N7 demolisher, a soldier with a rapid-fire weapon like the harrier and disruptor ammo, etc. you pretty much have to switch to a tech or weapons class because you'll be struggling to get a single warp-throw explosion off for the entire game.

This has to do with tech powers almost always acting as primers and layering themselves over biotic primers. If you're trying to detonate a biotic explosion on an armored boss and there's also a paladin spamming snap freeze/energy drain on it or a teammate firing their disruptor-ammo-equipped weapon at it, there will almost always be a new tech combo re-stacked over your primer by the time your detonator gets there, especially if you're at mid to long range and have to account for projectile travel time. This can often get so bad that your warp's entire duration will expire before you can get through all the tech and get a detonation at all and have to re-prime. It's sad because unhindered, you should be able to outright *kill* a boss's armor with *multiple* explosions in the time it takes a warp to expire. It's also frustrating because biotics do nothing to hinder tech players at all, and people who play tech classes exclusively may not even realize how much of a hindrance they are to biotics.

The way to fix this seems rather obvious: in cases where both a biotic and tech primer are layered on a target, make the biotic explosion take priority over the tech one when the enemy is hit by a biotic detonator. If this were implemented it would do nothing to interfere with the effectiveness of tech abilities, it would simply make biotics and tech work better together. Since tech powers don't detonate biotic explosions anyway, they wouldn't really even feel a change. So for example, say a target gets primed with warp and then hit with snap freeze. If another teammate hits it with a prox mine next the cryo explosion would still go off, but if the biotic tosses a throw, the biotic explosion would go off. Biotics would still be able to detonate tech explosions with their detonator powers so long as the target wasn't already primed for a biotic explosion. This way you could do the warp &gt; throw &gt; throw technique and still set off your own explosion as well as helping your teammate set of theirs, but you wouldn't have to worry about the tech getting re-primed before you get a chance to detonate yours.

It seems like the way to actually implement this would be to categorize your biotic and tech detonators separately and set up a simple script to check and see if the target is primed for a biotic explosion when hit by a biotic detonator and instruct the game to ignore the latest tech primer and cause the biotic explosion to go off instead. If the target is not biotically primed, it's business as usual and the tech explosion gets detonated as per the norm.

Basically I just want you guys to consider this and make sure I haven't made a misstep in logic somewhere. The way I see it, there is no downside to implementing this system for any player. It would allow all classes to play at full effectiveness regardless of what their teammates are playing. I'm not sure how possible it would be to actually implement on Bioware's part, as I know the way they designed their game isn't exactly highly modular in nature, but it would be amazing if they could. If you guys agree, we should try to bring it to their attention by maybe posting a petition on BSN or sending them an email.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1356362963.0,,PC,True,t3_15dioc,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/15dioc/fixing_biotictech_dissonance/,

I've been buying PSPs and SPs and recording the Ultra Rare drop rates.

Now if my calculations are correct buying Spectre Packs give you almost double the ammount of URs for the same number of credits

Initially I bought 100 of each, and compared the drop rates

100 PSPs gave 7URs - Drop rate of 7% - or 1 Ur per 14 PSPS / 1,386,000 Credits each
100 SPs gave 7URs - Drop rate of 7% - or 1 Ur per 14SPs / 840,000 Credits each

I thought it was interesting that both packs gave exactly the same drop rate.

I then carried on buying to compare 10 Million credits of each pack

10 Million Credits gave
101 PSPs (9,999,000 Credits) gave 7URs - 1UR/14PSPs - 1,386,000 Credits each
167 SPs (10,020,000 Credits) gave 13URs - 1UR/13SPs - 780,000 Credits each

If anyone is Interested I can post up exactly what I got in packs, and at what point I got the URs.

So, to make myself feel productive during this busy week, I have decided to take a stab at team guides. I sure hope to be able to write some more things, but time is precious. At least this week is full of time-intensive activities.

Remember those cool team guides we had a bit ago? Those were nice, but most needed all four players to be co-ordinated. Quite difficult if you ask me. Instead, let's try simple two-player teams that you and a buddy can go for quite easily. Even in PUGs, these combos should be able to pick up the slack.

**Introduction**

So as you may know, I love my basic Human kits. They are available to everyone and tend to be quite well-rounded. I was toying around with a Human Soldier with a maxed out Concussive Shot, and I thought to myself ""you know I bet this would be an efficient detonator of Tech Combos, especially with the new Fire and Cryo Explosion buffs"". 

So I thought about other classes that would be great primers and it hit me: Human Engineer would be perfect. With both Fire Explosions and Tech Bursts, any type of defenses would be annihilated. On top of that, everyone has access to both Human Soldiers and Human Engineers, so everyone can pull off this combo.

So I got fittyman to help me and he went Human Engineer while I went Human Soldier. The results were a fountain of tears of unfathomable sadness. From the enemies, of course. Being able to cause Tech Explosions at such a rapid rate put a smile on both of our faces and comments about it being overpowered were made. I highly recommend trying it for yourself to see the tears firsthand. 

So the combo revolves around the Human Engineer as a primer of Tech Combos and the Human Soldier as the detonator of said combos. Simple, yet effective.

**The Human Engineer**

*What does he do?*- This guy is the brains and primer of this combo. Depending on the defenses and number of enemies around, he will either set up for a Tech Burst (Overload) or a Fire Explosion (Incinerate). Typically he will be in the back row, like an old-school RPG mage, and cast powers non-stop.

*How do I go about building him?*- Fittyman uses something along [these lines](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Engineer/Human/PPKOA/Indra6AS5AT5/Hurricane3AU5BB5///OmniCapacitors5/) for his Human Engineer.

What's important is a high cooldown (say 150% or above) and having 6 ranks in both Overload and Incinerate to increase Tech Combo damage. Having a Chain Overload is also nice, but not mandatory. 

**The Human Soldier**

*What does he do?*- The Human Soldier is the brawn and detonator of this combo. Typically acting as a tank for the Human Engineer, the Human Soldier will be close to enemies to ensure they eat a face-full of weapon damage and detonating powers. Adrenaline Rush is typically used only in dire circumstances and when a boss needs to go down ASAP. Concussive Shot spamming is the norm for this role.

*How should I go about building him?*- I typically run this kit along [these lines](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/Human/ONEFR/Revenant10AD5AC5////WarfighterPackage5/).

What's important is having 6 points in Concussive Shot for stronger Tech Combos and having at least 3 points into Frag Grenades so that he can still detonate Tech Combos, even in Adrenaline Rush. In addition, a decent cooldown (above 50% or so) will help keep Concussive Shot able to rapidly detonate Tech Combos the Engineer will set up.

**Tactics**

While this will require some co-ordination, having a vigilant eye will help even mic-less teammates do this combination. 

Ideally, both the Soldier and Engineer will move together and co-ordinate whether they want to make a Tech Burst or Fire Explosions. The Engineer will use the power to decide which Tech Combo to make, while the Soldier just constantly detonates those combos to create Tech Explosions. 

The Soldier may wish to use Adrenaline Rush to maximize damage on a boss enemy, so in that case if a Tech Combo needs to be detonated Frag Grenades may be used to do so. Normally though, Tech Explosion detonation typically takes a much higher priority than ramped up weapon damage from Adrenaline Rush. 

Soldiers should also make sure to prevent too much heat going towards the Engineer, so he can continue using his powers. Engineers can self-detonate effectively while Soldiers are not so adept at doing so.

Engineers need to constantly prime targets and make sure the Soldier is not overwhelmed by enemies. Tech powers and Explosions are excellent at slowing down the enemy so the Soldier doesn't get killed from being swarmed.

So when should either Tech Bursts or Fire Explosions be used? 
This list is derived from experience, but these act more guidelines than rigid rules.

*Tech Burst (Overload)*- Synthetic enemies not on armor, enemies with Shields/Barriers remaining, a large crowd of enemies in a tight space (3+)

Targets ready to be detonated for a Tech Burst have electric bolts running around their body.

*Fire Explosions (Incinerate)*- Organic enemies on Health,  enemies on Armor, singular targets

Targets ready to be detonated for a Fire Explosion have flames going around their bodies.


**Conclusion**

We learned that the Human Soldier and Human Engineer can make for a potent pair of characters. Constant Tech Bursts/Fire Explosions  will decimate enemies and makes each character much more effective in unison than running off on their own.

While I certainly think is an optimal combo to exploit fast Tech Combos, it certainly isn't the only one. For example, the Human Soldier can be replaced by a Turian Soldier and the Human Engineer can be replaced by an N7 Paladin. I believe the combination of accessibility and versatility put these two as prime candidates for this type of play.

So, do you like this new idea of two-man combos? Do you know of any other combos that work quite well in tandem? Have you experienced this firsthand and loved/hated it? I can't know unless you write it down in the comments.

Justicars create good old Biotic Spheres for both defense and offence, N7 Demolishers give out ammo and some shields with their Supply Pylons, and N7 Paladins can create a small wall with their Omni-Shield. Even with all these classes to choose from, there is one class that is a true medic. Everyone loves a medic on their team and the Geth Engineer is that medic. 

While Infiltrators are good at reviving downed teammates, no one is better at keeping someone alive than a Geth Engineer. In between its turret that can heal, ability to see through walls and GO FAST, and stripping shields to stun enemies, no one can keep teammates alive better than the [Geth Engineer](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#23QKKIDf3@0DE@@R4Q4@0@0).

I actually borrowed (read: stole) this build from ThisIsAaron, with a few modifications here and there. And for good reason, since he was stealing all the points in the Gold games with a similar build. He borrowed it from someone else, so who knows who even started it. 

Uh-oh, I wish I didn't have see his face again. WHY CURTIS WHY?

**YO BRAH! I'M BACK FROM THE GRAVE**- You have got to be kidding me Curtis. **HEY HEY! IT'S ""THE CRITIC FORMERLY KNOWN AS CURTIS"", BROSEPH**- You're coming here to ask me to justify my choices, right? **Maybe**. Uh-huh ""Broseiden"", let me preempt you on that. 

____________________________________________________

**Geth Turret**- Specced for shield recharge. Why skip the final evolution for restore frequency? In between the high power recharge because of the low weight and [this useful technqiue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_iBqqO-Oes), that evolution is essentially worthless unless I am constantly spamming Overload. Quite useful trick when doing a hack or drone escort. 

Don't forget to send one down next to a teammate you are going to revive. It will either shield you when reviving or give the newly resurrected teammate plenty of shields. The flamethrower upgrade will ward off most attackers, especially those without shields.

**Hunter Mode**- Because I rely on Overload so much, I made sure Hunter Mode complemented that. In addition, the final evolution that allows for increased vision range and speed is immensely helpful to keeping teammates alive by spotting enemies and rushing towards players in need.

I advise turning Hunter Mode off when personal safety is more important than dealing damage. Examples include hacking objectives (when enemies can easily be seen because no powers are being used then), drone escorts (you can still spam the Geth Turret for shields), and running through a gauntlet of enemies (every bit of shields counts).

**Overload**- Gotta love crowd control. Recall that when an enemy initially loses its shields/barriers, it gets stunned for a little. Now mix that in with hitting several targets and Neural Shock, and it becomes easy to lock down a crowd full of enemies.

**5 in Power Passives/3 in Fitness**- I chose to maximize power damage, but not recharge. With Hunter Mode increasing power recharge speed/damage AND halving the base shields when active, I see putting points into Fitness more advantageous than a slight increase in power recharge speed or weapon damage.

If someone came into the lobby and there were already 2 or 3 of a race, they instantly changed.  It was nice.

As for the teams:

* In 4 of the games I played last night, Krogan was the race of choice.  It was fun, but the one game with 4 Kroguards was the most fun I've had playing MEcoop in a while.  (Those poor Atlases kept getting charged and meleed from so many different sides, they didn't know which way to turn.)

* Only one lobby went Asari.  2 Van, 1 Adept, and I went Justicar.  I was confused.  Do weapons do more damage than Biotic Explosions now?  I Reaved everything in sight, but the other 3 were more interested in Stasis &gt; headshot and couldn't be bothered to detonate any BEs.  Twice a Vanguard charged someone i Reaved and set one off and once someone threw a Warp at an Atlas I Reaved, but I was expecting a lot more 'splosions from an all Asari party.

*  The all-Vorcha group was a blast.  We went through enemy spawns like a swarm of Piranha, but at times there weren't enough kills to go around and it was kind of hard to keep Bloodlust ""in the red.""

* My favorite of the night was the all Batarian group.  Granted, this may have been because I haven't played as my BatSoldier in a month or so, and I fell back in love with the Ballistic Blades and heavy melee.  So many heads were punched off that round.

It happens mostly when I farm on gold, I will be behind the counter at the bottom of FBW and they only shoot at the barrier in front of me, instead of targeting people right out in the open who are shooting at it. I am not really complaining about it, because it allows the other players to attack it without getting anyone going down.

1346119762.0,30,self.MECoOp,yxsu6,Max McTankerson:  Krogan Sentinel Build,30,0,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/yxsu6/max_mctankerson_krogan_sentinel_build/,"Way back in the day, the Krogan sentinel was the first non-human character I unlocked.  We were best buds, and we played together all the time.  But, eventually I was seduced by the sexy allure of the Asari Justicar, and I left my poor Krogan friend behind, never to return.  Until now.

This past weekend, I played him for the first time in months, and I've gotta say, I really enjoyed this class.  [Here](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Sentinel/Krogan/PALLR/Falcon10AE5AD5/Claymore10BH5AP5/ShotgunRailAmp3/PowerAmplifierModule3/GrenadeCapacity5/) is the build I am using.  This build has more or less been discussed on this forum before, but only in a limited capacity and many many months ago, by posters whose names I don't recognize.  That also reflects my in-game experience, as I rarely see a Krogan Sentinel anymore.

Anyway, to the build!  First off, because of the damage protection from tech armor, this character has the highest effective shields of any character in the game.  Without any supporting gear / equipment, it comes out to roughly 2500 shields and 1900 health.  Unfortunately, because he lacks the shield recharge ability from biotic charge, he's a little more vulnerable than his Vanguard brethren.  Fortunately, this guy has one thing that the Vanguards don't have - the ability to ignore cooldown.  With no points in incinerate, he can carry whatever he damn well pleases.  I find this pleasing, as no Krogan would carry around a puny Carnifex just so he can spam incinerate.  In an ideal world, all Krogans carry big guns, preferably two.

Since the sentinel isn't going to be a great weapons damage class and he's going to be taking a lot of fire, I opted for crowd control with the Falcon for one of my guns.  I use it with incendiary ammo, which in conjunction with the Lift Grenades, can be used to set off fire explosions.  ~~Fire explosions are generally tricky to pull off, but given how high the damage of the Lift Grenade is with this build (1750), it's a lot easier~~ (edit:  not as relevant with new mechanics for Tech Combos)  Note, Fire Explosions are still relatively tricky to pull of with Lift Grenades, despite the balance changes to tech combos.  I'm not entirely clear what they are capable of detonating at this point, so if anyone wants to clarify, please reply with a comment.  Regardless, a crowd control weapon (e.g. Falcon, Scorpion) paired with a high damage weapon make a potent combination with this build.

While the Falcon and grenades are going to be great for your trash mobs, you're going to want something with a little more punch to deal with the heavy enemies.  I went with the Claymore, mostly because it's badass.  But other weapons that pack a punch would work well, too.  I will be disappointed if you pick a pistol or an SMG, though.  Think big.

Finally, a couple random closing points:

* Lift grenades have a 1.5x bonus against barriers, so one grenade is enough to strip the barrier of a Phantom on Gold (edit:  only if you use a Power Amp III or IV).  Two will kill it.

* Because lift grenades both set up and detonate biotic explosions, this class actually pairs well with biotic teams.

* Just keep an eye on your shields and always be close to cover.  This guy is strong, but he's not invincible.

That's all I can think of.  It's not the best class, but it's pretty good, and I always appreciate variety.

Hurricane 1 by itself, no ULM, cooldown shows +145.  Feels slow.

Add the Carnifex X, no ULM, cooldown shows +95 combined.  Feels downright sluggish.

Add ULM to the Carnifex.  Cooldown shows +121
Added ULM to both.  Cooldown shows +197

*1)* Buy recruit packs until you have maxed out all of the common weapons and mods.  This really should not take very long if you start doing Silver and Gold runs with a solid team.

*2)*  Buy all the veteran packs until you have maxed out all uncommon weapons, mods, and characters.

*3)* Finally, buy Spectre packs. 

Why do I buy in this order?  Two basic reasons:  

*1)*  Buying lots of the cheapest packs first ensures you have decent weapons, mods, and necessary equipment while you are leveling up your character classes.  
*2)*  As you max out a particular weapon or mod, that card stops showing up therefore freeing up the probability that you will get something new and better

By the time all of your classes are level 20, you should be buying the spectre and cashing in all of those credits for the rare and ultra items.  Gametipcenter has two good links talking about the rarity of [weapons](http://gametipcenter.com/mass-effect-3-how-to-unlock-weapons-in-multiplayer) and [characters](http://gametipcenter.com/mass-effect-3-how-to-unlock-characters-in-multiplayer).

I don't know if people have started talking about this yet, but I can't seem to find any good advice on the subject around the internet/reddit.

(Pyro tanks/headshots)

Cerberus is annoying, but not very exciting.  They all have easy-to-target heads, and are the most susceptible to crowd controling abilities like Stasis, Concussion Shot and Submission Net.  The Atlas can be a pain, but being considered synthetic, they have some rather embarrassing weaknesses.

But *Reapers*?  They have 3 enemies immune to basic CC(Crowd control), 2 of which can instantly kill you, and the other being things that hit as hard as primes from the same distance and speed as a Nemesis, without needing to take the cover.  

They can shield their allies with metal plates, throw grenades, and CC you if you're too close.  Hit a weak spot? Their children will leak out of their wounds and prevent your shields from recovering. If you KILL some of them, standing around where they died results in you taking additional damage.  

Got hit by a ball of lightning by a Banshee? Better take cover and restore your shields.  *Nope*.  You're now taking damage over time. Better hope you're not low on health!

Not only that, but the Banshees TELEPORT you.  Time to run away!  But wait, there's a brute in the way.  Better run around him!  Ravager on the other side of the map saw you?  You are now stagger-locked and shieldless.  

You break out and take cover to recover your shields, since a second volley would kill you.   Husk rushes you while you're in cover and grapples you.  You struggle with him, knock him to the ground and stomp on his face. 

That's when you notice that Banshee caught up and is standing right next to you.  Game over.


Nothing else compares to fighting Reapers.  I only wish Cerberus and Geth would put up half the fight that the Reapers do.

If you'd like to contribute, please note that I am also looking for *non-intuitive game mechanics*. For example, every infiltrator except the Asari Huntress gets a damage bonus from tactical cloak regardless of the attack form used (melee, gun, powers). Another example would be that sync-kills cannot occur on unequal elevations. 

**EDIT2:** Thank you very much for all your contributions so far. I'd like to take this opportunity to request some help. First, does anyone know how to repair the reversal of Annihilation Field's animation? Second, could anyone post a list of all guns that remain unaffected by weight-adding mods? I'd like to hyperlink it.


**Weapon Bugs, Exploits, Faults, and Mechanics**

* The Cerberus Harrier's in-cover recoil is larger than it's out-of-cover recoil (/u/mrcle123)
* Weight-adding weapon mods, such as high-velocity barrels, do not add weight to guns present before DLC additions [Details here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1hgso6/what_are_the_exact_conditions_for_the_heavy_mods/cauepwo) (*need complete list of other guns*). (/u/Chypsylon)
* The Striker can be ramped up and reap the benefits of Tactical Cloak bonuses without ever breaking Cloak. Simply ramp up, cloak, and continuously fire. (/u/mrcle123)
* Using weapons with infinite ammo (Particle Rifle, Lancer, Collector Sniper Rifle, Collector SMG, etc.) on a Drell will cause a player's aim to drift downward while firing. (/u/RepublicanShredder)

**Map Bugs, Exploits, and Mechanics**

* If you go down on maps with railings or areas open to off-stage areas (Rio, Hydra, White, Dagger, and more), [you can ""fall off"" the map and be auto-resurrected at the Landing Zone](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1jd0cy/crowdsourcing_a_college_post_would_you_kindly/cbdgvcv), given that you are near these railings/areas.. (/u/dahngrest) 
* Unequal elevations grant ""sync-kill immunity"": boss enemies will not instantly kill you if they are not on the same elevation (/u/dahngrest, /u/mrcle123). You can, however, be sync-killed if the enemy is standing on the same stair/parallel to your elevation on a ramp.
* Large storage containers in Rio make use of the above mechanic, disallowing large boss enemies from sync-killing. Phantoms can still sync-kill if they are in the storage container with the player (/u/dahngrest).
* Both Reactor and Hazard Reactor have rafters in which enemies can get stuck (most commonly Cerberus). This can't be prevented, but unseen enemies can still be revealed and killed by shooting the rafters. (/u/ryanadc)
* The doors or a door in Hazard Reactor may close permanently after turning on the reactor. No known fixes. (/u/ryanadc)
* The seeker swarm of Hazard Glacier can be expanded by shooting it. It does less damage in this form. (/u/mrcle123)

**Character-Specific Bugs, Exploits, and Mechanics**

* Asari Huntress does not get weapon damage bonus from cloak; instead, it is only a power damage bonus.
* N7 Paladin's Snap Freeze only requires Reach (Evo 4B) for 2x Cryo Explosion damage. Evo 6B is bugged and should not be taken. The AIU's Snap Freeze works as intended.
* The Alliance Infiltration Unit (AIU) does not get evo 6B's shotgun damage bonus off-host. (/u/mrcle123)
* the N7 Shadow's Tech Combo evolution of Electric Slash, 5A, does not work. (/u/mrcle123)
* the N7 Shadow's Shadow Strike power cannot target Atlases. (/u/quietowlet)
* the N7 Shadow's power, Shadow Strike, benefits from both power and melee bonuses. (/u/SarenMustBePots)
* Batarian Brawler Vanguard does not have the higher stagger resistance built into all other Batarians. (/u/mrcle123)
* The Vorcha Hunter moves as fast as basic humans and faster than other Vorcha (the slowest race in the game). (/u/mrcle123)

**Power-Specific Bugs, Exploits, and Mechanics**

* Frag Grenade evolution 6A only gives +50% instead of +75% damage. (/u/mrcle123)
* Flamer lowers your movement speed while active. You can move at normal speed by using Flamer *while firing* the Reegar Carbine Shotgun, and Revenant Assault Rifle. (/u/Chypsylon, /u/RepublicanShredder)
* Tactical Scan evo 5A, Headshot damage, does not work. (/u/mrcle123)
* Marksman and the heavy pistol's Cranial Trauma mod's headshot bonuses do not work on boss enemies. (/u/mrcle123)
* Sabotage evo 6B, Tech Vulnerability, does not work with homing grenades nor sentry turrets. (/u/mrcle123).
* Sometimes Annihilation Field's animation will reverse (will not prime when animated, primes without animation). No known remote ways to fix, but does eventually fix itself.

**In-Game Bugs, Exploits, and Mechanics**

* [Warp stacks ridiculously with Incendiary Ammo](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/18os9u/can_you_help_me_piece_together_how_incendiary/c8gn7pv), as well as Incinerate, Inferno Grenades, Flamer, N7 Paladin fire shield evo (/u/mrcle123).
* Incendiary Ammo's damage over time stacks with itself, causing more damage than expected. This is best applied using weapons with a fast firing rate (Reegar, Particle Rifle, Collector Sniper, etc.). [Details here](http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/14033200/1#14033200). (/u/AaronEh)
* Sometimes your powers and weapon will not respond to controls. This can be repaired by using a heavy melee attack. (/u/holku1984)
* If the above happens while you are a Volus, you must be staggered to restore controls.
* Entering cover from strange angles may leave you ""stuck"" a few paces away from the actual cover. Rid the problem by releasing all movement keys. (/u/602).
* The reloading animation can be canceled on all platforms. [PC players can find a demonstration here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/191guy/me3_coop_college_tips_and_tricks_505_reload/). [Console players can find a demonstration here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19s44r/mecoop_college_tips_and_tricks_505_reload/).
* Sometimes using a shield-refilling ability (Shield Boost, Energy Drain) with empty shields and low health will leave your screen red, making it hard to see. This can be repaired with an Ops Pack, by having the shields destroyed, or by getting downed and resurrected. (/u/TheChosenOne127, /u/HiddenIncome)
* Dying from enemy fire during a sync-kill animation will sometimes instantly revive you without using medi-gel. Conditions for revival unknown. (/u/mrcle123)
* A well-timed Ops Pack can prevent a sync-kill due to maximum damage reduction. [Details found here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1jd0cy/crowdsourcing_a_college_post_would_you_kindly/cbdjfd3) (/u/mrcle123)
* Using hard cover (making your character lean against the wall) grants damage reduction that can even mitigate damage over time.

**Objective-Specific Bugs, Exploits, and Mechanics**

* Cloaking during an Escort does not add movement speed to the drone. You must be both in the vicinity and visible to enemies.
* Dodging out of a hack-circle immediately after activating it will still count you as a hacking player (/u/mrcle123). If successful, the omni-tool will remain visible on your character, and you are free to roam the map.
* Package recoveries (Objects Recovered) can be expedited on PC, and to some extent, on console. See the Platform-Specific section below.

**Enemy-Specific Bugs, Exploits, and Mechanics**

* A brute's charge attack covers more area than the animation suggests.(/u/zetversus)
* Banshees can turn invisible. They can be spotted by their brackets, and their healthbar will become visible. (/u/zetversus)
* Many enemies bulky enemies, including Atlases and Praetorians, can be hit twice with a single shot given enough penetration. The single shot registers damage twice. (/u/mrcle123)
* With more than 2m penetration, you can kill a phantom by shooting its power block bubble without hitting the phantom itself. (/u/mrcle123)
* Geth Hunters can shoot through thin walls if their guns are phasing through the wall. (/u/mrcle123)
* Phantoms and Praetorians have bubbles that negate all power damage that usually lasts a few seconds. Sometimes they may become permanent, in which case gunfire is needed to kill the enemy. (/u/zetversus)
* If you are taken down by a Husk's or Abomination's grab animation, you will automatically resurrect if and only if you are taken down as a direct result of the grab. (/u/UsayNOPE_IsayMOAR)

**Platform-Specific Bugs, Exploits, and Mechanics**

* PC only: Shockwave's Radius evolution, 4B, is bugged. (/u/quietowlet).
* PC only: Players can ""run"" the 2-package objective. See demonstrations [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/18vzrr/mecoop_college_tips_and_tricks_505_video/).

**Miscellaneous Bugs, Exploits, and Mechanics**

* Sometimes a character card, namely a Retaliation or Reckoning card, will grant enough evolution points for a 6/6/6/6/6 build. This can be exploited (Renegade) or repaired (Paragon). [Details on solution here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1ja5dg/weird_bug/cbcm8rp). (/u/ryanadc)

1373095457.0,28,self.MECoOp,1hqmmm,War Machine (N7 Destroyer),35,7,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1hqmmm/war_machine_n7_destroyer/,"**Introdcution**

Now some of you here may be familiar with the N7 Destroyer. I put up a [generic Destroyer](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/14yh1u/the_marauder_n7_destroyer/) back in the day and it was a kit I most desired when the Earth DLC was launched (Was it the last card to max out my rare manifest? You bet.). Typically most Destroyers go with Devastator Mode and either Hawk Missiles or Multi-Frags. Now there's good reason for this as Devastator Mode can boost stats on weapons that most equipment cannot, which makes it highly coveted amongst both new and veteran players. And in a sense, Multi-Frags and Hawk Missiles both do crowd control and using both at the same time can be viewed as redundant. In addition to that, there already is a [DM-less Destroyer on BBLoB](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/165g34/the_carpetbomber_n7_destroyer_build/). So why am I writing this? Well, the current build is written with the intent that skipping DM is a little gimmick. I personally see it as legitimate playstyle choice with plenty of nuance in it. I've also come to learn a lot from playing this style with a few tricks that may come an help you.

I should start off by stating why I even tried this style in the first place. It all started off with the advent of the Reckoning DLC. Two things occurred in that DLC. The first is the presence of the Geth Juggernaut, which essentially acts as an excellent heavy weapons platform. The Juggernaut can act very similarly to the Destroyer as the near-perfect ramp-up weapon's platform (with his immense stagger resistance) and a better team player with great crowd control powers (Geth Turret and Siege Pulse both can control a crowd in their own right). From my perspective, the two classes started overlapping roles (ramp-up weapons specialist with minor CC) and I thought that the massively improved health pool, increased spare ammo, and team support ability made him better at the job. Second, the Venom was a new addition to the multiplayer arsenal. As I have said before, I've been ogling this gun for a long time and I do love my grenade launchers. Put two and two together along with some inspiration from /u/spark2's post and I went to work. I need to state that the choices I made on this kit did not come from a linear process and several choices melded together at once, with further refinement after the initial idea was set in place. The final product can be seen here in either [Kalence](http://kalence.drupalgardens.com/me3-builder#28!1B06535!3C05525!23O533!.809G) or [Narida](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/NDestroyer/AKMLR/Venom10AO5AL5/CerberusHarrier10BF5AC5/ShotgunRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator3/GrenadeCapacity5/), using Incendiary Rounds as the ammo of choice. Keep in mind this build requires some advanced weaponry and a poor manifest will severely hinder you capabilities using this setup.

Before I get into gory detail, the name should be addressed. War Machine is the name of the suit for Iron Man's BBFF James Rupert ""Rhodey"" Rhodes . There are some similarities between the Destroyer and War Machine. Those similarities include a shoulder weapon ((War Machine has a minigun on the back and a [baby missile launcher inside the shoulder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH7acnHahfQ) and the Destroyer has a missile launcher on top of the right shoulder), both suits being operated by black men (how could the Destroyer be anything *but* black?), both have extensive military experience, both use pragmatic fighting styles (no fancy lasers shows, PPR being a potential exception) and finally both have their natural armor colors being black and grey. Plus, the name is BADASS.

^^^Honorary ^^^names ^^^can ^^^be ^^^Mr. ^^^Torgue ^^^and ^^^Michael ^^^Bay ^^^because ^^^explosions.

**Power Evolutions**

*Passives*- Considering our primary weapon will be the Venom, we will do everything to boost its power. I took weapons damage and Rank 5 Power Damage since the Venom cannot score headshots. Shielding is also a given since we aren't focusing on melee here. Pretty normal as far as Destroyer passive goes.

*Devastator Mode*- An effective power, but slowing speed and preventing dodges makes him very susceptible to fast moving enemies (namely Praetorians, Phantoms, and Banshees). On top of that, DM doesn't really boost any stat the Venom can benefit from.

*Hawk Missile Launcher*- An excellent crowd controlling power that automatically fires every 3 seconds or so. All the top evolutions were taken as they are the best imo. The shield penalty reduction makes it much easier to use armor modules that aren't Cyclonic Modulators (though I think those are still the best to use), the refire rate makes it better against mooks overall, and Hydra Missiles actually have a chance to hit their target unlike Cobra ~~Commander~~ missiles that veer straight into walls.  Interesting fact: despite not possessing the necessary force to stagger most mooks at 360N, Hydra missiles can stagger everything that isn't a boss, Pyro, or Dragoon. Given that Hydras can force a dodge on those two enemies and the Venom can stagger everything anyways, this leads to excellent crowd control possibilities against non-bosses. Note that Hydra missiles *cannot* detonate Power Combos.

*Multi-Frag Grenades*- Put all the points into getting the best burst possible. Damage/Damage/Grenade Count offers the best burst and with Grenade Capacity these bursts can be used quite often. This power will be used most often for instant stunning of enemies and detonating Power Combos either from Incendiary Rounds or teammates. And at 2000+ Newtons per grenade, it should stun every boss in the game.

**Weapon Choices**

So the power evolution chocies were pretty easy and can meld with most weapons. However, weapon choice took a long time to figure out. /u/spark2's Carpetbomber used two explosive weapons mainly for staggering. While mildly effective on lower difficulties, I found out that it doesn't translate well when facing heavy bosses (the Venom being the exception, somewhat). With the lack of cover penetration present in explosives, I decided to carry one explosive weapon (given how that explosive weapon along with Multi-Frags and Hawk Missiles would give limitless crowd control as is) and one penetrating weapon to deal with enemies that is vulnerable to it like Ravagers, Atlases, Guardians, and cover-happy enemies at bad angles.

*Explosive Weapon* 

So there are 5 explosive weapons (that don't need Explosive Rounds to explode) in the game right now. They are the *Krysae*, *Striker*, *Falcon*, *Scorpion*, and *Venom*, in the order of personal effectiveness. Here is my thought process on choosing the Venom, aside from personal love of it. Since all 5 of these weapons shoot projectiles, they can instantly prime for Fire Explosions upon impact. 

1. *Krysae*- While it does use the relatively abundant Sniper Rail Amp, the Krysae fires too slowly to deal adequate damage and there are other weapons that can stagger more effectively than the Krysae. Proxy detonation is nice though, but it has too many downsides to compensate for that.

2. *Striker*- A ramp-up weapon. While great with DM, without DM it runs some risks of being interrupted and with the need to deploy Multi-Frags at a moment's instant, it loses its appeal in this setup. Funny thing about stagger resistance: I have reasonable belief that the N7 Destroyer has great stagger resistance even before DM is applied and is somewhere at a Krogan's level (video evidence later). 

3. *Falcon*- Now we're getting somewhere. It's an excellent stagger machine and can bounce off of walls, but it only has average DPS and it consumes precious Assault Rifle Rail Amps for added DPS for a relatively minor increase. Better left towards casters and those who don't have a good Ultra-Rare supply.

4. *Scorpion*- Now in the Ultra-Rare category, we get the equivalent of the [Noisy Cricket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqxFIpc1j4). While it seems tiny, it has alright DPS and can do good crowd control over an area. The downside is that they stick to everything, so getting around corners is the issue. Weapon of choice if you don't have a Venom or if you want to use a Shotgun as the penetrating weapon.

5. *Venom*- [I've already exalted this weapon before](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19zwly/fangs_of_fury_venom_shotgun_discussion/), so I won't boast about it too much. What I will say is that it's like having both a Falcon and Scorpion in the same gun *while* dealing good DPS at the same time. I said this before and I will say it again; anyone who thinks that the Venom does not deserve the UR status doesn't know what they are talking about. Two things that I did not go into great detail in that post that I use quite often in the video below are the concepts of shooting while sprinting and double tapping. Every chargeable weapon with a magazine greater than one is capable of both of these actions. The Venom can be charged and shot while sprinting, giving extra mobility and flexibility potential when rushing into enemy lines. Double tapping is where you shoot a charging (doesn't have to be fully charged) shot and then quickly tap the trigger again to shoot a second shot in rapid succession. Since most Cerberus enemies die in two shots, double tapping lets me chew them up in record time. Given it's flexibility and power, it's my explosive weapon of choice. 

*Penetrating Weapon*

So there are plenty of weapons that can penetrate cover with the addition of a piercing mod. Assault Rifles seem to be the best option with the addition of the High Velocity Barrel that negates 90% of armor damage reduction and gives a good 1.35m of penetration along with it. Since weight isn't an issue, the only downside of the HVB is negated. SMGs and most shotguns cannot penetrate as far with their HVBs, Heavy Pistols don't have HVBs (low RoF hurts them too), and Sniper Rifles need both piercing mods to get a similar effect (they are also ineffective at close range due to the no-scope penalty and most have a poor RoF, requiring impressive aim). So I put a table of the most common Assault Rifles I used and listed their benefits and drawbacks so you can come to your own conclusion on what is best.

|Assault Rifle|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Argus|Decent damage output, great for headshots, adequate RoF, adequate accuracy from cover|Recoil and accuracy are issues out of cover, burst nature makes it hard to track moving enemies, small-ish magazine size|
|Collector Rifle|Good accuracy and excellent recoil control, automatic firing, good ammo pool, good reload speed|Low damage output, small-ish magazine size|
|Harrier|Great reload speed, good accuracy, automatic firing, good punch per shot|Poor recoil/stability (bug worsens the issue), low ammo count, small magazine|
|Lancer|Good magazine size, automatic firing, infinite ammo, decent punch per pellet, good accuracy|Recoil issue, overheating is a problem, insufficient mod slots to fix main issues|
|Typhoon|Good penetrative power, does not suffer from penetration damage drop off, good sustained DPS, good magazine size|Ramp-up needed for best effect, low accuracy out of cover, can chew through ammo quickly|
|PPR|Good RoF, can multiply the effectiveness of Incendiary Rounds when ramped up|Overheating is an issue, needs to ramp-up for best effect, ineffective at sustained DPS|
|Saber|Great damage per shot, great ammo supply, good accuracy, manageable recoil|Semi-automatic nature makes it difficult against moving targets, sustained firing wears down fingers, does not benefit as much from a HVB as other guns|
|Valkyrie|Good punch per shot, decent RoF, good ammo supply, manageable recoil|Burst firing makes it difficult against moving targets and wears down fingers, headshot multiplier ineffective against bosses|

Personally, I'd go with the Harrier when I have teammates to provide that short burst of damage when I need it. Since I use it so sparingly in that case, the low ammo count doesn't play a big role and I count it as a non-factor when choosing it. If I am solo-ing or if I'm certain I cannot trust my teammates to take care of bosses, I take the Typhoon to chew through them at range. I had a good time with the Saber as it blends both, but the semi-automatic nature of the Saber put me off my game when I'm not prepared.

For the more advanced users around here, another good penetrating weapon is the Javelin. With 3.5 meters of penetrative power, you can pierce through thick cover accurately and gain a mini-thermal scope at the same time. Only advanced users should take advantage of this as it requires precise accuracy and good reload-cancelling skill to use effectively. The single shot does suffer from shield-gating quite heavily, requiring Hawk Missiles and DoT to finish off most enemies. It offers great burst damage due to the single shot nature if you hit the target. On the flip side, you get about two-thirds the effective sustained damage output (21.64 seconds vs. 14.61 seconds against a Gold Geth Prime (no headshots) according to the weapons calculator on the sidebar) compared to an equally leveled Typhoon, with the need to be scoped in to deal full damage.

**Equipment**

*Ammo Power*- Incendiary Rounds were chosen because it is effective against Armor and can prime for Fire Explosions. Against the Geth, I'd choose Disruptor Rounds due to the prevalence of Shields on the Geth. If Incendiary Rounds are in short supply, I recommend Warp and Cryo Rounds, but I'd make an effort to put Incendiary Rounds on even if it is only Level 1.

*Weapon Amp*- Since the main source of DPS is the Venom, I'm electing to use a Shotgun Rail Amp here. If my main source of damage was the penetrating weapon (e.g. Typhoon with the Scorpion as the explosive weapon), I'd amp that instead to get a bigger effect on the DPS.

*Armor Module*- This is where you can get flexible with what you want to use. I find Cyclonic Modulators and Adrenaline Modules to be the most effective while Power Efficiency (minimal effect) and Power Amplifiers (does not affect force, proportionally minimal damage effect) are the least effective. Stabilization Modules should only be used if you're penetrating weapon needs recoil compensation (e.g. Lancer with HVB and Mag mods), but I find it unnecessary most of the time.

*Gear*- Since Multi-Frag Grenades are really good, I chose Grenade Capacity as the mod. Shock Trooper Upgrades or Warfighter Packages are also good gears to choose since they increase both grenade count and weapon damage.

Sometimes it involves everyone playing as the same race/kit, sometimes it involves only using a certain weapon, and some of us feel that play with braindead PUGs is the ultimate challenge. Taking on a fair challenge is fun, so I decided to help with the weapon/race challenge myself.

In an attempt to create the weapon/race challenge, I've created a few tables relating a weapon to its *user*. Not manufacturer, but end user. For example, the Avenger was manufactured by the Elkoss Combine (Volus), but the gun is used by nearly every race. Hence, I called the user Mercenary (no restrictions). I tried my best to come up with the most appropriate users

That leads me to define some terms when it comes to the user list. 

* Mercenary means anyone can use the weapon in question. Geth, Asari, Krogan, Human, etc. can all use Mercenary weapons

* Humans are divided into two subdivisions: Alliance and Cerberus. Cerberus are the two Ex-Cerberus kits (Adept and Vanguard) while every other Human belongs to the Alliance. I once considered subdividing the Alliance into N7 and not N7, but then I realized that everyone was N7 so that really didn't make sense.

* Blood Pack members include the Krogan and Vorcha.

* Council weapons are available for anyone who is a part of Council Space. This consists of Salarians, Asari, Turians, and Humans along with the Drell and Volus.

* Anything with an * means either that I am unsure about it's true user or the user may not fit what other people may think and thus will have a comment below the tables.

I hope that these tables will give people some fun ideas when playing with interesting restrictions (e.g. all Salarians, Jade, Salarian weapons). If you have questions or comments, I always enjoy seeing good orange envelopes when I hit F5.

**M-22 Eviscerator**- Developed by Humans but predominately issued by Cerberus, like the Talon.

**M-11 Wraith**- Technically developed by Humans, these weapons are not distributed by the Alliance because it is violates galactic law. Hence, mercenaries and other shady users are the main users of those guns. By extension, there's no racial profiling on who uses the gun.

**N7 Piranha**- Designed by the Alliance but intended for 'lighter-bodied' species to get rid of Husks.

**Krysae Sniper Rifle**- Devolved by Turians but they released the schematics so that anyone can make it.

**M-98 Widow**- There's so much confusion about it being a Quarian, Geth, or Alliance gun that I went with the fact that it was slated to be rolled out the the entire galactic market yet based off of Geth design.

**M-77 Paladin**- I saw it used by C-Sec and it was intended for law enforcement yet it's based off the Carnifex (Mercenary).

""No!"", you say.  ""Not another Collector Adept build!  And not another build from this guy who just posted one yesterday!""

Well, I apologize, but this is easily my favorite class out of the new DLC, and I'd like to share some of my thoughts on it.  It has one of the most unique powers in the game (Dark Sphere), and it's very difficult to find a build that feels right.  I've respecced six times now, and I think I've finally landed someplace that's worth sharing.

####BUILD

I'm going to split this into a couple different, but very similar builds.  [**HERE**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Adept/AwakenedCollector/NILND/CollectorSMG1BB5AV5//SMGRailAmp3/PowerAmplifierModule3/ExpertPackage5/) is Build 1.  While it is unique among the builds that have been posted, it does have a lot of similarities to [MemeMauler's BEEEEES! build](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19imtp/beeeeees_cooldown_reduction_collector_adept_build/).  But there are some noteable differences that I wanted to detail.

[**HERE**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Adept/AwakenedCollector/NILIF/ArcPistol10BK5AI5//PistolRailAmp3/PowerEfficiencyModule3/CommandoPackage5/) is Build 2.  In the case that you don't have the CSMG (or it's a lower level than you'd like to use), this presents an alternative that still plays exactly the same but will probably be a little less effective overall.


####POWERS

***Dark Sphere:***  While there are effective ways of playing this class without this power, IMO, DS is what makes this class fun and unique.  And, really, it's a very good power if you've got the cooldown to use it frequently enough.

With these builds, DS serves two purposes - one is to strip the shields of / kill lower-tier enemies, and two is to prime them for extra weapons damage (assuming the use of Warp Ammo for this build).  There seem to be some misconceptions about the DoT on this class.  The number it shows in the in-game class builder is the *total* damage that will be applied, not the DPS (note that narida's online class builder that we use on this subreddit still isn't right for the DoT).  At best, you can spec it to about 100 DPS, which, really, is peanuts compared to the damage you're going to be putting out through detonations or your weapon.  For the playstyle recommended in this guide, I think it makes more sense to take Recharge Speed over the extra DoT.  As is, both builds are powerful enough to strip the shields of all Gold lower-tier enemies except Phantoms, though several heavier enemies like Pyros will take some of the DoT before their shields are dissipated.

Really, since you probably won't be using a weapon affected much by shield-gate with these builds, the shield-stripping threshold isn't critical to spec for.  So, take Radius if you like - I find 7m is plenty, but 9m might feel even better - I haven't tried speccing it that way.

Note, DS detonation does have a hidden Force component that will stagger enemies.  I'm not sure if this Force scales without damage bonuses, but jesuspeeker was kind enough to test on Gold with this build with no Power Amps or Mods, and a DS detonation was enough to stagger a Gold Atlas ([*video here*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US-lqRCRn-c&amp;feature=youtu.be)).

***Seeker Swarm / Fitness:*** Seeker Swarms are used just for the damage protection.  Because of the way the damage protection formulas work, 3 / 4 points in Fitness is going to yield you more protection than investing in the Evolution 6 extra Orb.

***Dark Channel:*** Fairly standard DC build, specced for max damage against Barriers / Armor.  Because of multiplicative bonuses to these defenses, it does quite a bit of damage in its own right (roughly 600 DPS vs. Barriers and 450 vs Armor for Build 2), and this is why I put the full 6 points in the power.

***Passive:*** The two builds differ significantly in the choices here.  Build 1 is intended to max weapons damage from Prothean / Collector weapons.  Note the Ancient Weapon bonus is multiplicative and applies to both your weapon and ammo damage.

Build 2 is for other weapons, and it boosts Power Damage instead, so that you don't have as much need to use Power Amps on the build for the DS detonations.

####WEAPONS

Build 1 is designed around using the CSMG.  The CSMG actually does a very respectable amount of damage on this build, and given the ease with which you can hit headshots with the weapon, lower-tier enemies should go down quite quickly (especially when primed).  Now, having a higher ranked CSMG helps quite a bit.  Partially because of the weight and damage, but more so because of the clip capacity.  The first 10-11 shots you fire with the CSMG consume double ammo, so it eats through clips relatively quickly.  Regardless, even a CSMG *I* can do burst damage of 1600 DPS against Health / Shield / Barriers, and 2400 against Armor on this build.  Each clip of a CSMG *I* would hold about 5300 worth of potential damage against non-Armor defenses, and 8000 damage against armor.  Reload on the weapon initiates instantaneously if it doesn't overheat, and the gun reloads 1/3 of its max capacity per second, so effectively a 3 second reload if you nearly empty the clip.

A CSR would work as well.  In fact, the CSR would be a better anti-boss weapon than the CSMG, but it does hurt the DS cooldown (another 1.6 seconds from a Collector SMG I to a CSR X).  If you're playing on Gold and want to focus more on lower-tier enemies, I'd personally go with the CSMG to keep that cooldown as low as possible.  I would stay away from the PPR on this build / playstyle - it doesn't really synergize well with the casting / detonating of DS, IMO.

In case you don't have the CSMG or the CSR at decent levels, Build 2 is specced with the Arc Pistol, which is quite light for the damage it's capable of outputting.  Just remember to use charged shots when you can - they do proportionately more damage.  Other pistols or SMGs can work, too, but I'd keep an eye on your cooldown.  DS is very sensitive to this because of its long base cooldown (24 seconds).  A low ranked UR pistol like the Paladin might add a second to DS cooldown, which is really quite noticeable.  Ideally, with Build 2 you should be able cast / detonate DS every 6-7 seconds.  Anything much longer doesn't feel as effective, in my experience.

####EQUIPMENT

I see two choices for your Armor Module - either a Power Amp or a Power Efficiency Amp.  You can shave close to a second off your DS cooldown with an Efficiency Amp, but a Power Amp will increase the strength of your detonation.  I specced Build 1 with the Power Amp since I invested the class passive points in weapon bonuses.  But Build 2 I went with the Efficiency Amp since I have the power damage bonuses in the passive.  Both are specced to be able to strip most Gold shielded enemies.

Warp Ammo is a must for this class.  You are a priming machine with DS and DC.

####PLAYSTYLE

I play this as a Close / Mid range class because you generally don't want to have to wait for DS to travel long distances before detonating.  Fortunately, the class is decently durable with its good base Fitness and the damage protection from Seeker Swarms.  You really have to make soft cover work for you with this class.  Remember, detonations work through walls, so use that to your advantage.

There are quite a few variations on how you can order your power and weapons use with this class, and the decision I make generally depends on the size of a group of enemies, the type of enemies, and the distance of the engagement.  The table below shows some of the ways I might deal with different encounters.

Range|Size of Group|Enemy|Action|Notes
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:---
Close / Mid|1|lower-tier|DC -&gt; Weapon|maybe just weapon, depends on enemy
Close / Mid|&gt;1|lower-tier|DS -&gt; DS Detonate -&gt; Weapon|May throw in a DC before detonation for stagger effect if too many enemies
Close / Mid|1|Phantom|DC -&gt; move out of LoS -&gt; Weapon or DS -&gt; DS detonate or both|DC will take down Barriers in 5-6 seconds
Close / Mid|&gt;1|Phantom|DC -&gt; run|no shame in retreat
Close / Mid|1|Boss|DS -&gt; DC -&gt; DS Detonate -&gt; Weapon|don't want to trigger DS cooldown before applying DC, may need to aim DS at boss' feet
Close / Mid|&gt;1|boss|""""|May missile in late wave, may also retreat depending on situation
Long|boss|DC-&gt;weapon| |probably will try to close distance
Long|any|any barrier / armor enemy|DC|May as well keep DC productive if you don't need it at that exact moment

Most of these DS detonations should be happening fairly close to your position.  This isn't a class I'd hunker down and start launching them halfway across the map.  You're generally better off closing the distance and then launching / detonating quickly.  Most of the time, I'm looking for a group and the ability to detonate enemies, and then fire on them with my weapon.  If I do decide I want to use DC, I find it's best to first launch the DS (which doesn't trigger cooldown), then DC, then detonate DS.

But often, I find I don't need DC when I'm using DS to prime.  If I can have DC off someplace else doing its magic, all the better.  It's great against Phantoms, as a single cast can kill a Gold Phantom in about 15 seconds without you having to do anything else.  So, if you see one across the map, throw out a Dark Channel and move on to business elsewhere.  DS can take care of most of your priming, provided your cooldown is quick enough.

As for Ascension Stance, don't bother.  The bonuses are additive, and they're not worth the constant recasting, IMO.  More importantly, given I play the class at Close / Mid range for the most part, I'd rather not have the penalty to my durability.

And finally, in terms of using the Seeker Swarms for biotic detonations with enemies primed by DS, I generally don't recommend it.  If you're going up against a single enemy, you're usually going to get more damage just from firing you weapon, since those explosions will be so weak (844 on Gold, had you put 6 points in both SS and DS).  Against a group of enemies, I could see it having some value, but I seem to have a hard time finding opportunities where it's going to do much for me.  And if you launch off one swarm, what next?  Do you take the time to launch out the other two and reset the power, triggering yet another longish cooldown?  I'm happy just to take the damage protection, and that has worked well for me.

####SUMMARY

This class is a lot of fun.  I do think that these particular builds are most useful up through Gold.  DS doesn't have as much value against boss enemies, so were I building for Platinum, I might go all-out with a weapon-centric build and switch to the PPR or CSR.  But, IMO, that sort of defeats the fun of the class.  Dark Sphere is the heart and soul of this class, and I'd hate to be playing without it.

1362361589.0,31,self.MECoOp,19m011,Team Build: Holy Trinity,40,9,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19m011/team_build_holy_trinity/,"**Introduction:**  This team build plays off the MMORPG idea of the ""Holy Trinity"".  The Holy Trinity (for those of you that don’t play MMORPGs) is the idea that you need three things for a successful group: a tank, a healer, and some damage dealers.  If you have competent people dedicated to filling those roles and only acting within the constraints of those roles, you will have a MUCH easier time with the task at hand.  My friends and I brought this concept over to ME3 with great success and absolutely trivialized several Gold matches.  We are going to bump it up to Platinum in a couple days just to see if we can handle it even though our manifests aren’t really up to par just yet.

**The Tank:**  Geth Juggernaut.  Without question this character is the best tank in the game.  His ability clog a choke point or stand tall in an open field surrounded by enemies is simply unmatched.  Not only do you have insane health/shields, but you are completely immune to sync kills.  If you start to get hurt you can recharge your shields while locking an enemy in place with your heavy melee.  Put simply, when played correctly this character just will not die.  For his build I went with:

* Hex Shield, all evos into defense.  This is basically the only power you are going to use and it is perfect for adding an additional bit of protection for the people behind you.  The reason for going full defensive on this power is because you want your shield to be up for as long as possible and provide as much protection as possible.  If you go into the damage evos you are losing shield strength, duration, and size.

* Siege Pulse.  Radius, Damage protection, Number of charges.  You will activate this at the beginning of the game and NEVER shoot it.  While it is active you will receive 40% less incoming damage, which means you survive longer.  Your goal as the tank is to survive, not to hurt things.  

* Geth Turret, skip.  This ability is for doing damage and shield regen, neither of which you are worried about.

* Geth Juggernaut.  Weapon Damage, Stability and Ammo, Weapon Damage.  You don’t use powers.  You want your guns to hurt.

* Hardened Platform.  All durability.  You are a tank and you need those health/shield/drain boosts.  Melee damage is unimportant because you aren’t trying to hurt your enemies with your heavy melee, you just want to recharge your shields and lock the enemy in place.

**The Healer:**  Volus Engineer.  [Basically you will follow this build](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1545zn/volus_viable_possibility_impressive_technical/) (Credit to I_pity_the_fool).  Your goal is not to hurt things (even though you will end up doing so).  Your goal is to enable your team to hurt things.  Your prox/recon mine will increase the damage done to the enemies who are swarming the tank.  Your Shield Regen will not only heal the tank, but provide an additional 50% damage reduction to him.  He already has 40% from Siege Pulse, this will bring him to a whopping 90% damage reduction which will make him pretty much unkillable.  You will need to keep your eyes open while playing this character so you don’t get killed.  If you go down, the tanks job becomes MUCH more difficult.

**Damage Dealers:** This is the flexible part of the build.  Your damage dealers need to be able to put out as much hurt on the enemy as they can.  This can be done several ways and largely depends on your friend's play styles.  Biotic Primer/Detonator combos(my favorite), Tech Burst combos, Fire/Cryo explosion combos, or Infiltrators with Black Widows...  the choice is yours.  Whatever you go with you need to make sure they stay alive and keep putting bullets/powers into the enemy.  If you die, you cant make the enemy die.  

My favorite match was when we used the Asari Justicar and Krogan Shaman as damage dealers.  The Asari dropped AoE Reave on the groups that surrounded the tank and occasionally dropped an offensive evo'd Biotic Sphere on the tank to increase the damage taken by the enemy.  The Shaman just spammed Shockwave (evo'd for detonation strength) into the group to detonate all the Reaves.  It was by far the most ridiculously simple Gold match I've ever played.

So we've had the new classes for a few days, and they're all pretty awesome.  I unlocked the Juggernaut, the Collector, and the badass Talon Merc. While the other classes are cool, they're lacking a certain something, a certain pizazz.  So far the Talon is my favorite, because he shakes things up a bit.  And let's all be honest here: **the Omni-Bow is FUCKING AWESOME.**  So this build focuses on the Omni-Bow, and hence is named quite aptly, methinks.

ANYWAYS.

**Powers and such**

(Thanks to [u/weetchex](http://www.reddit.com/user/weetchex) for the link)
Keep in mind that the last power tree on the character creator isn't correct, it's essentially just a place holder for now.

Don't worry, I'll explain everything.

**Cain Mine**

Fun, effective for watching your back, but that's not the point of this build.  Skip it.

**Concussive Arrows**

Now the fun starts.  Take grenade capacity, shock, grenade capacity.  These aren't too useful, but the extra grenades help.  If you're okay with a lower capacity, go ahead and skip this and throw it into the trip mine, it's not like I have a gun to your head, I mean jeez.

**Armor-Piercing Arrows**

The highlight of this build.  Take damage, armor damage, and arrow count.  This does a nasty amount of damage to pretty much everything so far as I can tell.  These are going to be your go-to, so get used to 'em!

**Passives and the like**

**Elite Mercenary**

Power Damage, Power damage, charge generation.  What makes this build so effective is that this guy regenerates grenade ammo.  How friggin' cool is that?!  So that means if you're pinned down and can't make it to an ammo box, or your teammates are also using grenade classes, or whatever, you don't have to worry!  Just chill for a second and he'll poop a few arrows out for ya!

**Omni-Bow Mastery**

Damage, shield recharge, damage.  Pretty self-explanatory.  If you're feeling really confident, take damage all the way across the board.  

**Weapons, gear and stuff**

I like to run this guy with the Saber and the Reegar.  ~~You don't have to worry about recharge time so you can honestly take whatever weapons you want~~. As Weetchex has pointed out, the regen rate is based on cooldown time, so try to pack light if you don't want to run the to box all the time.  Stick with only 1 weapon.  Personally I go with the Saber.  For gear, I use either the Warfighter Package or Grenade Capacity.  Equipment is usually cyclonic modulator, incendiary rounds, and a strength enhancer.  

**So.**

There you have it!  Mass Effect's very own master bowman.  Just remember to play it smart, play it safe, and that *omni-bow is a real thing* and **IT IS FUCKING COOL AS ICE**.  

As a side note, I think a team build based on the Lord of the Rings guys would be awesome.  Something like this guy, a slayer/shadow for Aragorn, and obviously a melee volus for Gimli.  Make it happen, people.

Trust me, this one is a beauty. If you want an easy as fuck solo, use the EDI Bot. She's got insane DPS with the Reegar as a result of decent passives, a shotgun evolution in Tactical Cloak and Snap Freeze debuffs. And her Repair Matrix gives her incredible survivability. Combine that with her inbuilt agility and you've got an ultimate hit and run class that you will have no trouble wasting scores of troops with.

[Build link](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/AllianceInfiltrationUnit/PNQNA/ReegarCarbine10AL5BH5//ShotgunRailAmp3/AdrenalineModule3/ShockTrooperUpgrade5/)

* **Weapon: Reegar Carbine** with High Velocity Barrel and Spare Capacity. Arguably the best shotgun out there, it's reliable against all enemies. As for ammo types, I recommend Incendiary for the ridiculous DOT but Warp and AP are also good.

* For gear, I'd definitely recommend **Shock Trooper.** Repair Matrix functions like Stim Packs and grenades, so the more you can have on your person at all times, the better.

**Tactical Cloak (6): Damage, Recharge Speed, Shotgun Damage.** Pretty self explanatory. We're going for maximum overkill.

**Snap Freeze (6): Reach, Cryo Explosion, Damage and Weakness.** This is your debuff, spray it from cloak before unleashing the Reegar on anything and everything on your screen.

**Repair Matrix (6): Survivability, Duration, Enhanced Repair Matrix.** This gives you 40% DR, a 20% movement speed bonus, and restores a healthy 232.50 shields per second for 22.5 seconds. I like to have these things up as much as possible, as they make up for the complete lack of points in Fitness. Replenish these as you would Stim Packs as they will be saving you a lot of Medi-gels and Ops Packs.

**Unshackled AI (6): Weapon Damage, Headshots, Weapon Damage.** Again, self explanatory. Pump out as much damage as you can.

**Fitness (0):** You really don't need it. 500/750 base health and shields is already above average and you get shield regen and even a free revive from Repair Matrix. Plus cloak. Be daring, live on the edge! Everything dies before it gets a chance to hurt you anyway.

And that is my EDI Bot build. I have to say that, having unlocked and played five out of the six classes, I definitely think they're all good, but holy hell this Infiltrator is by far my favourite. She's definitely top tier, I reckon if Ghost is King, she's Queen. Which means a nerf is definitely incoming.

1360293767.0,29,self.MECoOp,183ynz,MeCoOp college 603: powers: sustained powers/abilities,43,14,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/183ynz/mecoop_college_603_powers_sustained/,"Hey everyone!  It's Professor Dr. Knight Simplywaffle the Third, here to teach you about sustained powers and abilities.  These are not activated abilities, like adrenaline rush and marksman, but rather powers like Tech Armor, Barrier, etc.  These are all very good powers that have many bonuses for the player, but usually at a cost.  Most evolutions either increase the standard buff, decrease the nerf, or introduce some great additions.  Some of the powers have de-activation effects, while others do not.  I will go into those if the power has a de-activation ability.


So, the powers are: Barrier, Blade Armor, Fortification, Bloodlust, Devastator Mode, Missile Launcher, Hunter Mode and Tech Armor.



**Barrier**

The first ability demonstrated is Barrier.  Available on the Krogan Shaman and the Kroguard, this is a very good power.  When you turn it on, the character has a purple ""aura"" and when detonated, it blasts the ""aura"" out.  While activated, 

* it has a base damage reduction of 25%, 
* reduces power recharge speed by 50%, 

and has a very good de-activation ability, which

* can hit up to 4 targets, and ragdoll 2, making them open for BE's (only health enemies can be ragdolled)
* has a base force of 500N
* Base damage is 500 against all enemies, with 750 against barriers


The power evolutions are quite good as well.  For first rank, either choice is good - more power in the de-activation is good, and 5% more DR is ok, but slightly unnoticeable on gold and higher.  For the second rank, the 30% power damage buff is great, and the shield recharge is nice on some builds.  The last evolution is a toss up between caster and tank - one cuts down power recharge speed by 30% (making it only 20%) while the other gives 10% more DR.  Any way you mix it, Barrier is a solid power.


**Blade Armor**

The next ability is Blade Armor.  Available on the batarian soldier, sentinel and vanguard, this ability ADDS SPIKES TO YOUR ARMOR.  how cool is that?  The visual is giant spikes on your shoulders.  Is has no de-activation ability, but while activated it gives

* base 25% damage reduction
* base 15% melee damage bonus
* base 100% melee damage return bonus
* base power recharge speed reduction of 50%

For the Batgaurd and BatSent, melee damage is very good for hate sliding.  The 5% more DR is unnoticeable on gold and up.  The damage returned is bugged.  While maxing out at about 2000 damage, it calculates the damage weirdly.  On bronze and silver, it takes the damage receives, triples it, and returns the damage.  On gold and plat, it divides the damage by 3, and returns it.  Hmmmm.  However, it is still a great ability, worth maxing out for the DR, melee buffs, and awesome spikes.


**Fortification**

Available on the Krogan Soldier and the Geth Trooper, Fortification is a variation on Blade Armor.  The visual when activated is a series of white hexagons covering the character.  No visual on deactivation.  When deactivated,

* base melee damage bonus of 50%

When activated, it provides,

* base 25% damage reduction
* 50% power recharge speed reduction

A poor man's Blade Armor, but it does have a good part - a 30% power damage buff when activated.  For the Geth Trooper especially, this greatly helps his flamer ability. It can have good DR, and you can get a max of 100% melee damage bonus when deactivated - cool for a melee krogan soldier or geth trooper.  Very nice power, if only for the power buff and melee.



**Bloodlust**

Available on the Vorcha soldier, sentinel, and engineer, this interesting power has an awesome feature - with every kill, regardless of how the vorcha got it, increases the stack of Bloodlust, which intensifies the base effects.  Each stack lasts for 15 seconds, leading the Vorcha to be a fast kill machine.  The visual is a red glow around the vorcha.  Sometimes, when you get a kill, you will stand back and howl.  This is just a visual.  Sometimes annoying.  The default level of bloodlust is 1 stack, and is how the build maker shows it.  The attributes are:

* base 5% movement speed buff
* base 50 health regen
* base 10% melee damage bonus
* base 60% power recharge speed reduction

There is no de-activation ability.  But, you can imagine, with each stack, the vorcha gets faster, deadlier, and more survivable.  The evolutions are either geared towards movement speed and melee buffs, or health regen buffs.  Health regen buffs are usually preferred.  The evolution 4 and 5 grant either a 5% power damage buff or a 5% weapon damage buff.  Either is good for the vorcha.  IS THIS POWER NOT AWESOME?!?!?!?!?!?



**Devastator Mode**

Devastator Mode, available only to the DESTROYER, is a great power.  The visual is a pulsing red glow around the character, making you look badass.  Once turned on, it turns the Destroyer into an almighty tank.  The base values:

* Can't dodge
* reduces movement speed by 10%
* base 10% weapon damage bonus
* base 10% rate of fire bonus
* base 15% magazine size bonus
* Can't be staggered(!)

Now you see why this is awesome.  You get more ammo, more damage, faster shooting, YOU CAN'T BE STAGGERED, and you're a bit slower.  The evolutions range from shield recharge speed, weapon accuracy bonus, magazine size upgrades(!), ROF bonuses, more damage bonuses, or the almighty 40% shield buff (of original shields), bringing the destroyer's shields up another 400 points.  Wow.  This ability pairs nicely with the next ability,



**Missile Launcher**


Another Destroyer exclusive, this power has been buffed since it was released.  The visual ""turns on"" the missile launcher on the destroyer's shoulder.  When activated, every few seconds it will send a small missile at the enemy you have targeted.  The details:

* base missile fire time of 4 seconds
* base 200 damage
* base 200N force
* base .5 meter radius
* base 50% of base shield reduction

now you see why Missile launcher wasn't liked.  low damage, coupled with a high shield penalty made it unattractive.  However, with the evolutions, it can give a base shield reduction of 10%, armor damage buff and the final evolutions give you an option of choosing between launching 3 missiles (with decreased force) or 1 super-dee-duper missile. Better, huh?  A good alternative to multi-frags, because it automatically fires, so you can keep firing away with your PPR/Typhoon without stopping.  Plus, you won't annoy your demolisher friends by taking all their 'nades.  Thanks to Zidijan to letting me know.


**Hunter Mode**

Available on the Geth Trooper, engineer, and infiltrator, Hunter MOde is full of wall-haxxing and awesomeness boosting goodness.  The visual covers your screen with computer-y stuff (is hard to see icons though with it on) and turns the geth's ""eye"" into a disco light show flashing between red and blue.  With fantastic buffs and 1 downside, it is a great power.  DETAILS!!!!!!

* base 50% shield penalty on base shields
* base enhanced vision range of 15 m
* base 5% damage bonus
* base 10% accuracy bonus
* base 5% movement speed bonus

Wicked, huh?  While it does cut your shields, it allows you to see hunters, and see through walls and cover.  Great for sniping.  The evolutions mostly vary between power buffs, either through recharge speed buffs or damage buffs, or weapon damage buffs, through accuracy or ROF buffs.  For the last evolutions, it's either enhanced vision buff (up to 24 meters!) and a movement speed buff, or an all around damage buff.  Any way you cut it, this wall-haxxing awesomeness is great.  Don't pass it up.  But if you do, good for you.  have fun.


**Tech Armor**

You didn't think i'd forget about this, would you?  Available on all the sentinels except for the Paladin, Vorcha and the volus, it has good activated buffs and a good de-activation power.  The visual is an orange hexagonal holographic armor.  For the de-activation:

* base damage of 400, 600 against barriers
* base force of 1000N
* base of 3 meters

For the activated parts,

* base 35% DR
* base 50% power recharge speed reduction

While covering your character in a cool glowy armor (fashionable AND functional) this is the mother of all sustained abilities.  With the evolutions you can get up to 50% DR (wow), a sweet 30% power damage buff or 40% melee damage buff, or you can get the power speed recharge penalty down to 20%.  Badass, huh?  The detonation is quite helpful in staggering a pesky hunter/phantom, mopping up swarmers, and other stuff.  There's also a glitch/bug/thingy where if you're being sync-killed and you mash the Tech Armor button, it'll detonate the sync-killer and you'll be free. I haven't done it, but it has happened to my friends.  



A note about damage reduction: i talk about it a lot, but I don't describe it.  here's the formula for determining how much DR you actually have, because it's not how much you think:
Damage received = Base Damage * ((1 - Sum of Damage Reduction Bonuses) * 0.75 + 0.25)


So to take 0 damage, you need 133% DR.  So, on a 50% DR build Krogan sentinel, getting hit by 1000 points of damage, the damage received = 1000 * (1 - .50) * .75 +.25) = 625 pts of damage received.  Got it?  Good.  Thanks go to Interwebninja for explaining it to me. 


So there you have it.  The sustained powers of ME CoOp.  Hope you had fun.  TIME FOR A TEST!  just kidding.  


Any corrections/notes would be cool.


Thanks to RepShred for reminding me about the visuals.

Have they told us what class it is?

There's no Krogan Infiltrator or Engineer, is it one of them of an extra sentinel or soldier kit?

It would make perfect sense that a Krogan Infiltrator wouldn't cloak and use a sniper rifle from afar.  A krogan Infi would cloak, get really close to you, and then smash you in the face.

It would be hilarious if KroHammer guy was the Krogan Engi.  I could imagine the conversation at the Combat Engineer conferences . . .

*Human* - We have perfected a quasi-holographic Combat Drone that can project large electrical charges and manufacture Omnitool-calibre homing missiles.  We have also created a deployable pylon that manufactures heat sinks and grenades as well as replenishes shields and biotic barriers.

*Quarian* - We have also been working on a deployable sentry turret by reverse engineering from Geth designs.  While we have yet to master the shield replenishing capacitors employed by Geth models, the offensive capabilities of our model are nearly identical.  We have also developed an Omnitool scanning app that provides real-time tactical data about enemies, with the added benefit that out scanning frequencies are so disruptive that they have been shown to slow down a target's movement speed and (in theory) makes them more susceptible to headshots.

*krogan* - **WE PUT A HEAVY THING ON A STICK.  IT IS GREAT FOR HITTING THINGS WITH.**

One last question:  Is it more likely that the Hammer be rendered on the character model at all times, or will he just pull it out of his butt [Shao-Khan style](http://imgur.com/Uf9MV5E) when you hit heavy melee?

Their relative inaccuracy combined with the other aforementioned characteristics makes them suited for medium to close ranges only.

Since the damage per bullet on most SMGs is even lower than on assault rifles, armour penetration or weakening of some form is very important (and mandatory on gold/plat).

All of the SMGs are very light, making them suitable casters or backup guns for other classes. However they are generally only suited for close range combat so ensure that complements the play style of the class.

Unfortunately, SMGs are for the most part outclassed by Assault Rifles and Heavy pistols and users will often find more success with a weapon from one of the other two classes.

A note about SMG mods is that with the exception of the Collector SMG, the heat sink is always superior to the magazine upgrade.

1359160051.0,28,self.MECoOp,17aeme,Team Badass (Team build),35,7,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/17aeme/team_badass_team_build/,"Team builds seem to have fallen out of favor again, compared to about three weeks ago, but I find them fun to write. The last two times, I did a [Tech](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1689ud/tech_dream_team_team_build/) and a [Biotic](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16d180/the_spice_of_life_biotic_team_build/) team, so I'll round out the trifecta with a team built around ""Combat""; A.K.A., guns, and lots of them. It's a more modular build than last time, with roles to fill rather than specific classes, but I'll suggest good classes to use for each role. Here we go.


**THE ROLES:**

**The Heavy Weapons Guy**: (*Krogan Sentinel, Krogan Soldier, N7 Destroyer, Turian Sentinel, any Batarian, etc.*)

""*Us against the unknown, killing it with big guns. Good times.*""

-Wrex

This is the member of the team in charge of drawing fire away from the other members of the team so that they can do what they do best. You'll need to be tanky enough to take some fire, as you'll be the closest one to the action. The other members of the team rely on you to keep enemies' attention, so don't worry if you're not doing tons of damage. Do what you can, and abuse soft cover and gimmicks specific to your character to stay alive. The classes I've suggested all have their own form of DR, and great shield and health values, along with stagger resistance on most of them. This job is best complimented with (as the name and quote suggest) big, big guns, as CD tends not to be a huge deal with these kinds of classes, and you should take advantage of that. Shotguns work best, as you'll be up near the action, and the less time you spend out of cover shooting, the longer you'll live. Focus on Big Bosses, Cover Busters, and Troopers (in that order) to keep the rest of your team safe.

**RECKONING UPDATE**: With the advent of the Geth Juggernaut, almost nothing else comes close to being as good at this job as Jugmaster Flash. He's got insane survivability and decent damage, which is everything you need and more for this job.


**The Sniper**: (*Gethfiltrator, Infidrell, Salarian Infiltrator, etc.*)

""*Scoped and Dropped!*""

-Garrus, constantly

This member of the team is in charge of outputting huge DPS against single targets. HW guy should draw a good amount of fire, so you'll be able to keep enemies off him by drilling new holes in their head. Focus on enemies that are the biggest threat to the rest of your team-- this is usually Suppressors (like Ravagers) or Captains (like Marauders). The Salarian Infiltrator is fantastic against Cerberus or the Geth, as their Suppressors are Shield/Health enemies, which he does great against. Gethfiltrator is best against Reapers or Cerberus, as their Suppressors have no shield gate, but are armored, giving him the advantage with his massive single-shot potential. The Infidrell is a good generalist, as his great weapon damage and Recon Mine is always useful, and has none of the weaknesses of the other two. Stay in the back, away from enemies, and eliminate threats to the rest of your team. Simple enough.

**RECKONING UPDATE**: A [Kishock Talon](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19ij2i/zaeeds_legacy_aka_how_to_make_the_talon/) is also a good choice for this slot.


**The Harrier**: (*Turian Ghost Infiltrator, Turian Soldier, Turian Havoc Soldier, Quarian Marksman, Batarian Soldier, Quarian Male Infiltrator, Shotgun Gethfiltrator, etc.*)

""*I WILL DESTROY YOU!*""

-Jack, and every ME1 enemy

No, not the gun. This member of the team is in charge of hit-and-run strikes to pick off weak enemies and run out the wave budget. Assault Rifles are your best bet with this guy, as they eliminate overkill and are  generally fast to shoot and reload, and relatively light. The Harrier (gun) is a fantastic choice on this guy, as is the Valkyrie, Particle Rifle, or the Mattock or Phaeston if you don't have any of those. Other good guns include the Hurricane, Piranha, Wraith, Reegar, Talon, etc. You're in charge of doing lots of damage from mid- to close-range. You'll flank the enemy, and fire with relative impunity as they focus the rest of your team. For this reason, mobility is key for this role-- jetpack Turians, Hunter Mode Gethfiltrators, or even just a player who can move around the map fluidly helps immeasurably. Focus on Cover Busters, Troopers and Big Bosses to keep the rest of the team safe and run out the wave budget ASAP. And for god's sake don't die, as you'll likely be the farthest out of the way for anyone to revive.

**RECKONING UPDATE**: The AIU, with its insane speed, survivability, shotgun damage, and general brokenness makes for a fantastic Harrier, until the nerfbat comes down hard, anyway. In addition, a Cabal Vanguard specced for weapon damage and Nightshade blades makes a good Harrier too.


**The Support**: (*Any Volus (Engy and Merc work best), N7 Demolisher, Quarian Male Infiltrator, Geth Engineer, etc.*)

""*Hold the line, men! HOLD THE LINE!*""

-Kirrahe

You're in charge of keeping everyone else alive and kicking. Do that however your class of choice does best; heal and debuff if you're a Volus Engineer, heal and distract if you're a Volus Merc, stun enemies and keep everyone supplied if you're a Demolisher. You get the picture. This role is also in charge of reviving downed squadmates, so use CC and cloaks whenever necessary. CC is another job of this role; Scorpions and Falcons are the order of the day, with Arc Grenades also being great. Keep enemies at bay, and keep allies alive.


**CONCLUSION**

The regular tips still apply-- stay aware of where enemies are, and don't be afraid to run if you get swarmed. Other than that, do your role and you'll be fine. This team takes a bit more skill than my other two, since... y'know... aiming, but when pulled off right, it's just as deadly. Play to your personal strengths and the weaknesses of the factions you're up against, and you'll be fine. Have fun, and Happy Shooting.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1362362625.0,,Spectre,True,t3_17aeme,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/17aeme/team_badass_team_build/,
1358605605.0,31,self.MECoOp,16vjo2,Mecoop College - Equipment 407: Consumables,34,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16vjo2/mecoop_college_equipment_407_consumables/,"I thought I'd put together some information about the various sorts of consumables (thermal clip packs, medi-gel, etc) and give you my opinions about how best to use them. Brain dump follows:

As you know, the maximum number of times you can use these things in a match is two, but you can expand your capacity to five\* with gold cards from the store. The limit was originally 10. People who had more than five before the limit was reduced were allowed to keep them. 

**COBRA MISSILES**.

* According to my interpretation of the variable names in coalesced.ini (found at bioweapon.ini\sfxgamempcontent\sfxweapon\heavy\consumable\rocketlauncher), the cobra instantly kills enemies within 2m of its contact point (there's a variable 'gibrange' set to '200f'). There's a continuum of damage from 50,000 points (enough to kill everything but a platinum atlas) which gradually decreases to nothing at 7.5m from the impact.
* The missiles also hit through walls.
* Since the weapon appears to have an actual damage value, we can surmise that abilities like tactical cloak and adrenaline rush can make your missiles more deadly.
* Allies, swarmers and husks can block the missiles, so aim carefully. In the open, it's often a good idea to aim at the floor so that missiles don't sail off into the wild blue yonder.
* On non-objective waves, it may be a good idea to nuke spawns if you feel your team is not up to scratch. Reaper spawns take up a lot of space, so it may be an idea to aim for a wall off to the side so that you catch them all.
* On objective waves: with hacks on gold, leave nuking banshees and primes to the last possible moment. I think it's best to nuke the hack zone just before it becomes overrun. Doing it too early means that the bosses simply respawn and you're using a rocket every 15 seconds rather than every 30. On VIP assassination waves: consider using a missile to kill the target. As a bonus, if you kill, say, a VIP atlas and a guardian, the next target will often be a guardian rather than an atlas.
* Remember that on objective waves, you gain far more money by using a missile to make sure you clear the objective, than by being stingy. Failing a wave 10 objective on gold costs you 30-odd grand, roughly the cost of a jumbo equipment pack and worth far more to you than one measly missile.
* It's a good idea to switch to your missile launcher as soon as the thought ""oh shit!"" has entered your head. Those times your team is stuck in a cycle of being killed and revived? That time your on wave 9 and pinned by two banshees? When you see three phantoms over the corpse of the guy you came to revive? All good times to use a nuke. Be careful of possessed abominations though - if you have an ability that grants a few moments of invulnerability (like stim packs or shield boost), it's a good idea to use that before blowing up the possessed abominations and praetorians that are headbutting your teammates.

**OPS SURVIVAL**

* Often people use ops survival packs and complain that they were taken down moments later. While this is sometimes due to lag, there is another reason. Froghorn explains [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/xqbvz/updated_and_comprehensive_list_of_bugs_and_broken/c5owt70). (Essentially, you have a shield gate just like enemies do. A single piece of damage (ravager blast, atlas rocket, marauder bullet etc) which completely depletes your shields won't pass through and damage your health. After your shields blow, you get total immunity to damage for a short time - 0.5/0.25/0.1/0.01 seconds depending on your difficulty level. After this, even if your shields are restored, your shield-gate *won't* block large amounts of damage for 3 seconds. Note that froghorn is incorrect about the cooldown - it's 3 seconds, reduced from 4 in the November 14th balance changes).
* It's a good idea to remap the key for the ops pack to something you can reach in a panic (I've got mine on 'Q').
* In coalesced.ini, (in biogame.ini\sfxgamempcontent\sfxpowercustomactionmp\consumable\shield), it suggests that using an ops survival pack grants you 1000 bonus shields for 20 seconds.

**MEDIGEL &amp; REVIVES**

* When you're revived, you get a small amount of damage reduction: 75%/50%/25%/10% for 2.5 seconds.
* Users on the PC often remap the medigel key to something convenient (like 'E') so that they can reload cancel - social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/11033675/1 - better.
* People seem to have fewer medigel than other consumables. IMO this is an indication that they (and I include myself here) should be using other consumables like ops survival packs and cobras more. It's pointless hoarding those - you're going to have to buy a jumbo equipment pack when you run out of medigel, and those give you as many missiles and ops packs as they do medigel, so you gain nothing by holding on to them. It's true that if you have 255 of a consumable then packs will start giving you level 1 weapon rail amps. It is not true however, that if you max out your weapon rail amps, ammo types and armor modules, that jumbo equipment packs start giving you nothing but ultra-rare weapons. Unless you have a desperate need for pistol rail amp Is, I suggest using your consumables. I guarantee you'll make more money that way.
* It's often fairly sensible to wait for a bit and tap the spacebar than revive instantly and hope that noone noticed your death. You don't want to run out of medigel and die just before deactivating the fourth device because you used a medigel of shame during wave 1.
* You can often cancel the 'getting up' animation with a heavy melee or a dodge. Useful if a praetorian is over your corpse.

**THERMAL CLIP PACKS**

* Thermal clip packs restore your ammo, reload your weapon, provide you with up to 10 grenades, and, according to BSN user peddroelmz's measurements, give you a 100% additive damage boost for a few seconds.
* As with other consumables, you might want to remap the key for thermal clip packs to something convenient (I have it on 'Z').

Finally: a reminder that failing the wave 10 objective on gold when you have a realistic shot at succeeding without using every last consumable is a pointless economy. You loose far more money than you gain.

1354413275.0,29,self.MECoOp,144q64,Mr. Freeze (N7 Paladin),36,7,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/144q64/mr_freeze_n7_paladin/,"*Learn it well, for it's the chilling sound of your doom.*

**Preface**

I was thinking of call this kit The Shield ([A special cop in PAYDAY](http://payday.wikia.com/wiki/Shield)), or Bumblebee Man/Purple Thunder (the Paladin has a cool pattern scheme), but then I recognized that the Paladin helmet kind of looks like [Mr. Freeze](http://projectquinn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Mr-Freeze-Poster.jpg) played by Arnold Schwarzeneggar. Combine that with how the Collector Sniper Rifle vaguely looks like a Freeze Ray (with Cryo Ammo giving it super-freezing powers) and Snap Freeze, and that's how this Paladin got its name.

**Introduction**- *Allow me to break the ice.*

So the N7 Paladin is unique in that it can create all three types of Tech Explosions all by himself. Tech Bursts are excellent against synthetics and Shields/Barriers, while Fire/Cryo Explosions are amazing at getting that crowd control and Armor damage. Let's try and take advantage of his [ability to control the battlefield and have a nice gun as well.](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Sentinel/NPaladin/IQPDP/CollectorSR10AS5AR5//SniperRifleRailAmp3/PowerEfficiencyModule3/OmniCapacitors5/)

Instead of the usual power discussion, I'll instead talk about some tactics instead, as the powers were designed for utility first and Tech Explosion damage second. The tactics are much more interesting (and important) than the setup.

**Omni-Shield**- *Their bones will turn to ice! Their blood will freeze in my hands!*

Before talking about the Tech Explosions, the Omni-Shield deserves special attention. It is capable of shrugging off most damage (even Praetorian laser beams and missiles) without breaking and can even chill enemies with the proper set-up. The deployment of the Omni-Shield is useful for tanking during power cooldowns and defending players in a hacking circle/annex objective. The Omni-Shield deployment can be cancelled after planting either by a melee attack, roll dodge, or power (such as Energy Drain). The slowing effect of the Cryo Shield melee is very useful in my opinion, and can prime for Cryo Explosions if done right.

Which brings up an important note about the chilling effect of the Omni-Shield. If you do a light melee (just a shield bash), you get to chill the target but it doesn't prime for a Cryo Explosion. Basically you give them the cold shoulder. *However*, if you do a heavy melee (planting the shield, then shield bashing) the target will be primed for a Cryo Explosion. Cryo Shield will count as a Rank 6 primer so it will help create huge Cryo Explosions, especially with Snap Freeze.

*Edit*- Through further testing, a deployed Omni-Shield acts like Blade Armor. Enemies that try to melee you (like Assault Troopers and Dragoons) will be snap frozen (primeable for Cryo Explosions) and damaged as if they were hit by a heavy melee. The initial deployment of the Omni-Shield also gives a similar effect, although the radius is very small (say ~1.0 m) Mildly useful at best, but it's good to know. 


**Tech Burst (Energy Drain + Snap Freeze/Incinerate)**-*Let's kick some ice!* 

You will rarely make Tech Bursts all by yourself, but Energy Drain is an excellent detonator for Tech Bursts do to the instantaneous nature of Energy Drain. You can prime on all targets (3 second priming window applies), but Energy Drain can only detonate when the Shield Drain effect applies (Shields/Barriers being drained, synthetics). Also, Snap Freeze will have the Tech Burst detonate with the Paladin being the center of the Tech Burst, not the target itself.

Shields/Barriers in general shouldn't be an issue because in between a single Energy Drain and some weapons fire, Shields/Barriers go down very quickly and even faster with teammates with anti-shielding powers/weapons.

**Fire Explosion (Incinerate + Energy Drain (Drain Effect)/Snap Freeze)**- *Mercy? I'm afraid my condition has left me cold to your pleas of mercy.* 

Fire Explosions will be your long range anti-Armor technique. This generally is self detonated (with Energy Drain) against the Geth, due to their synthetic nature, while you will need the help of others to detonate them easily on organics at long range. In my experience, it's better to just Incinerate a target at long range and then close the distance than depend on Fire Explosions as a main source of damage. Why, you ask? Because synthetics (and sometimes organics) don't care that they are on fire, but freezing them forces them to chill out.

**Cryo Explosion (Snap Freeze + Energy Drain (Drain Effect)/Incinerate)**- *What killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age!*

The main attraction of the Paladin. In between Cryo Explosions' damage/radius, mass freezing ability, and buff to Incinerate's Freeze Combo evolution, Cryo Explosions are the best Tech Explosion one can hope for. 

Snap Freeze has three useful properties for making mass Cryo Explosions.

The first is its ability to go through walls. Like Shockwave, Smash, and Electric/Biotic Slash, Snap Freeze can damage and prime through walls. Very useful in keeping the Paladin alive by minimizing risk to himself. And at 15m, it can prime for Cryo Explosions at a distance farther than you would think. 

The second is Snap Freeze's ability to prime several targets by sweeping the freeze across the screen. This means that the Paladin can prime several targets, and use Incinerate on different targets to make several Cryo Explosions in a row. 

Finally, Snap Freeze can prime Cryo Explosions through any defense (Barriers, Shields, Armor). This makes it very easy to make Cryo Explosions any time you are within range. A lot of powers can detonate Snap Freeze, so spam it away to take advantage of massive Cryo Explosions.

On Geth, Cryo Explosions will likely be detonated by Energy Drain to due instantaneous explosions and gaining those desperately needed Shields. On organics, Incinerate detonating usually is a better option as it is more reliable and Incinerate benefits from the 100% damage bonus from the Freeze Combo evolution. Overall Cryo Explosions make for some pretty cool effects and results, and should be the main source of damage against enemies. 

One of the great benefits of focusing on Cryo Explosions (and its chilling effects) is that enemies become much slower. If you remember from my discussion of the [Vorcha Engineer](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/13bkbt/taser_taser_vorcha_hunter_engineer/), I vaguely mentioned how speed directly affects the power of enemies. Debuffing speed is just as important as debuffing Armor damage reduction in my opinion, and Cryo Explosions will put enemies on ice and kill their movement speed. The reasoning is that slower enemies are much easier to deal with as it gives you more time to damage them or choose to run away.

**Weapons**- *No matter what anyone tells you, Bane, it really is the size of your gun that counts.*

The Collector Sniper Rifle is pretty chill. It does have some weight behind it and can run out of ammo quickly, but it does boast several advantages that are unparalleled by other weapons.

* **Extraordinary damage/ammo applicability output**- The CSR has amazing damage output and combined with rapid burst firing, it can apply ammo powers at a very high rate. This means that if you have Cryo Ammo, the application of the speed/armor debuff will cause the enemies to freeze in their tracks in a very short time. jesuspeeker, another Redditor, is a big fan of the CSR and the person who showed me how amazing that gun is.

* **Unlimited ammo, but cautious reserves**- All this means is don't drop the ammo to 0, which is not to hard if you burst fire and mix it with powers. DO NOT GET TO ZERO AMMO OR ELSE IT WILL BE VERY BAD. The cooldown on overheating will make your temper flare after two or three overheats. On the plus side, you no longer depend on ammo boxes. I think that's pretty cool.

If you are in the market for something with much less weight, I recommend the Hornet with Stability and Capacity mods. The Hornet has amazing burst damage and is very reliable in dealing with enemies with a rapid volley of headshots. At X, it will put you at a nice and comfortable 195% cooldown and you can equip the Expert Package (SMG damage + power recharge) to further improve the strength of the Hornet and N7 Paladin.

**Conclusion**- *You're not sending ME to the COOLER!*

Don't neglect the N7 Paladin. He is multifaceted and can mix with any team (even Biotics as Snap Freeze is very effective to slow enemies to be caught by a Biotic Explosion). You may want to skip the nice ice puns, as puns are an under-appreciated form of humor because everyone is jealous they didn't think of them first. 

And that is why you should play as an N7 Paladin. He is a true Sentinel in terms of both tankiness (Omni-Shield) and being multifaceted (all types of Tech powers and Explosions). Easily one of the best characters up there with the Turian Ghost, Geth Infiltrator, and Asari Adept once you understand how he works.

1352911461.0,31,self.MECoOp,136rak,The mods which supposedly add weight are bugged,37,6,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/136rak/the_mods_which_supposedly_add_weight_are_bugged/,"From BSN, tests performed by Hyperionyht and confirmed by Cyonan:

*The mods which are supposed to add weight do not apply their cooldown penalties to non-DLC weapons. They are intended to add 50 points of weight each to lengthen your cooldowns, but currently only do so to weapons which were originally produced as DLC.*

*I don't have video evidence, but you can easily confirm this yourself. Equip an appropriate weapon without mods and take note of a cooldown listed on the powers menu. This is the effective value. Then, equip one or two of the mods in question on the same weapon and take note of the adjusted cooldown. This is the purported cooldown. Fire up a game with a stopwatch in hand and time your recharge rate. You will receive the effective, not purported, value.*

*List of DLC weapons for which these mods work as intended:*

*Assault Rifles:*

* *Striker*

* *Harrier*

* *Particle Rifle*

* *Typhoon*

*Sniper Rifles:*

* *Kishock*

* *Krysae*

* *Collector Sniper Rifle*

*Shotguns:*

* *Reegar*

* *Piranha*

*Pistols:*

* *Acolyte*

*For all other weapons, the cooldown penalties are not applied. This includes the promotional weapons. The applications of this are obvious and the glitch can be very convenient for some power-heavy builds.*

~~Also, from further testing by Homey C-Dawg, it seems adding a DLC weapon secondary will make the added weight work on your original weapon. But if your secondary was in the game at launch, the extra weight mod will still not add weight to whatever weapon it's attached to. Example: Wraith with HV Barrel and Talon secondary will not induce the weight penalty on the Wraith, but the same Wraith with an Acolyte secondary will.~~

EDIT:

It turns out that actually, equipping ULM is what breaks the bug. Both the pistol and SMG ULM mods. So if you want to abuse this glitch, do not use ULM on anything and you're good.

In the greatest possible way.,35,6,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11xnz7/sohavoc_strike_is_a_little_buggy_in_the_greatest/,"In a glorious, glorious way. Melee havocs are the strongest class in the game now, even Kroguards can't compete.

[I made a video to show you what I mean.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up1HKgDHDwI). Starts at 1:18.

Basically, there's a weird thing going on with Havoc Strike (HS) and heavy melee (HM). If you HS and then HM before you actually charge your target...THAT happens. And your cooldown isn't touched.

This results in some fun shenanigans. According to my math I'm doing roughly ~3k damage per heavy melee, and a little under 800 with each havoc strike. That's 3.8k dmg/1020N every second. Nothing stands up to that for long. I can one-shot a Brute on bronze, two on silver. Took down a Gold prime in eight seconds. You can permanently stagger Phantoms on any difficulty (takes 1k force to stagger.)

You have near invulnerability (you're ALMOST immune to staggers, but if you're not host or you're not on your toes, you're in trouble.) Then again, that's fixed with Stim packs.

And it can be followed with the usual fun stuff HS chains into. Mainly another heavy melee or a dodge. But why bother doing that when you can infinitely Havoc Strike?

I'm hesitant to even share this just because I don't want it fixed because it's goddamn hilarious, but I should share it anyway. Keep it just between us on reddit though, k? &lt;3 Hopefully Bioware doesn't notice.

In the past, it was one of my top few go-to guns, but since the release of the Harrier, I haven't bothered using it much.  Still, inspired by RepublicanShredder's recent human engineer thread, I've been playing a lot with that character, and I decided to use the Mattock as my weapon of choice.

Holy crap.  This thing does incredible damage, and for its weight, it has to be one of the top few weapons in the game right now.  I have a Harrier III, and both the burst and sustained DPS are roughly equivalent to a Mattock X.  I don't know why this didn't occur to me earlier, as the two guns have exactly the same damage per level now (although the Harrier's fire rate is ~20% higher).  The semi-auto fire is probably annoying to some, but it also reduces the problem of overkill and wasted ammo.  I don't need to run to ammo boxes nearly as often with a Mattock.  With the human engineer with a Power Efficiency Module II/III, the timing on reloads syncs well with the magazine size of the Mattock.  When I'm firing at boss enemies, I can unload a full clip, start to reload, and reload cancel with a shot of incinerate (this is more helpful to us console players, who don't have the benefit of the easier PC reload cancel).

I know this isn't exactly news to much of this subreddit, but if you're a newer player and you're trying to find good weapons, the Mattock is where it's at.  It's good at pretty much everything, it's lightish, and it ranks among the top few weapons in the game for DPS.  Buy those Veteran Packs and max this thing out.

Also, I have no idea why they buffed it.  Depending on class / build, the closest competitive rare gun in terms of DPS and playstyle is the still-awesome Piranha (which weighs the same, and does about 25% more DPS at the expense of accuracy and recoil (assuming a smart choke / shredder for Piranha and extended barrel / piercing mod for Mattock)).

Finally, I'll admit I've always had a hard-on for assault rifles.  I like being able to administer my damage efficiently, and given the stability / accuracy / range of most assault rifles, they continue to be my favorite class of gun.

We had 3 GI and 1 QI, but my friend and I suspect a geth engi would be a better fourth one since it can help regen shields and overload, but doesnt really matter, 3 melee GI are enough to dissolve a prime in 1 to 2 seconds. 

And that's all you need to do: 

* set it to geth gold, map doesn't matter, smaller the better, glacier is the best imo, pick at least 3 melee build GI. 
* learn from aut0mati0n's [guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/s7jir/the_glass_cannon_aka_pure_melee_geth_infiltrator/). Let me elaborate a bit here - proper step: turn on hunter mode, cloak, shoot prox mine at feet, heavy melee, and enjoy 2-3 lines of melee kill updates
* DISSOLVE EVERYTHING. It's almost like a mobile missile tank. Go at the prime together and it'd would go down in seconds. 

Tips: 

- bring light weapons to max cool down

- better not do it on cerberus or reapers (could work but risky and takes longer time)

- kill them in groups, move on if see your friend is already onto one group

p.s. no shooting skill required, except maybe the prox mine part. 

Bonus point - it's way more fun than sitting behind the L desks!

By this point in time I've gotten every class up to twenty at least once and do Silver runs regularly with some tries on Gold whenever I can organize a few friends. As such, the list will be mostly focused on Silver.

**Sniper Rifles**

1. If you're in Infiltrator, I recommend the Widow or the Mantis. Both are capable of oneshot headshotting all basic infantry types and can still oneshot advanced infantry (Centurions, Marauders, Rocket Troopers, etc) with the tac-cloak damage bonus. The Widow is generally superior against large high armor targets while the Mantis beats it out against infantry. The Black Widow is nice but loses a lot of potential damage because the third shot in the clip generally cannot be fired fast enough to get the damage bonus from Tac-cloak. The Valiant is a worthy alternative if you lack a high level Widow or Mantis because, unlike the Black Widow, you can get all three shots off within the span of your tactical cloak damage bonus.

2. Non Infiltrator classes that do not spam powers will prefer the Black Widow for its higher potential damage per clip and the ability to engage three enemies per thermal clip instead of one.

3. Power spamming classes would generally be better suited without a sniper, but if you are determined to use one then the Viper is a good option for biotics and Mantis is a good option for tech specialists. The Viper will beat out the Mantis at stripping shields (typically what adepts have the most trouble doing) and the Mantis is just a generally solid choice against armor and infantry, which is typically what tech specialists would need.

**Assault Rifles**

In my personal opinion all the options currently are rather lacking. The main issue with them is that although they may have high DPS, none of it is burst, meaning you must remain exposed while emptying the thermal clip (unlike with a heavy pistol or sniper). However, there are still several effective choices if you so desire.



1. The Mattock is a good choice in almost any situation because of its high damage per shot and good accuracy. However, it suffers at closer ranges and when dealing with multiple enemies at once, which are situations most assault rifles are useful in. When planning your loadouts, consider the Mattock a heavier pistol.

2. The Avenger is generally the best traditional assault rifle. It's insanely lightweight, has a nonexistent reload time, and can still pump out a large amount of damage when pointed at the head. Just make sure to fire in bursts at longer range unless you're using the stability mod.

3. The Falcon, much like the Mattock, is an effective Assault Rifle mostly because it is nothing like a traditional assault rifle. The main draw here isn't damage (which is still quite nice), but rather area of effect suppression. Using the Falcon you can effectively lock down entire spawns or chokes, constantly staggering any enemies who try to move through. The slow rate of fire means that it's not as effective in this role as it once was (enemies have a brief moment of movement between shots now), but it's still leagues ahead of any other weapon in this regard. (Thanks to Runescrye for reminding me this had been rebuffed).

4. The Revenant, while generally useless, can become incredibly handy in the hands of a Turian Soldier. Their natural bonuses to stability don't offset this weapon's terrible recoil, but they do minimize it. With the recent damage buffs this weapon actually outperforms the Avenger during Marksmanship.

**SMGs**

Much like assault rifles, I don't really see many people using SMGs effectively in most of my matches. If you're looking for low weight, go for a pistol. If you're looking for automatic fire, pick up an Avenger (it's actually lighter than most SMGs). If you're looking for close range, pick up a shotgun. Still, there are several niches which SMGs fit in passably.

1. The Shuriken is effective at stripping shields at any range if you lack other options. While it is technically burstfire, you can feather your bursts in such a way that it's basically automatic. It has the added bonus of being incredibly common, and thus easy to get to rank X with.

2. The Hornet actually provides huge burst damage if you can deal with the recoil. While it might seem counter intuitive, hipfire with it as much as possible. Aiming actually significantly increases this weapons's recoil. This leaves the Hornet to fill a close range shield stripping niche.

**Shotguns**

1. The Graal Spike thrower is an amazing weapon. You can fire from the hip and use it as a traditional shotgun but the true strength of this weapon lies in the amazing accuracy it has while aiming. The spread of this gun is actually pinpoint when you aim down the sights, meaning that as long as you can adjust for travel time (it's not hitscan) you can cause serious damage at mid and even long range. Add in the fact that you can charge shots when dealing with armor (for bigger single shot burst) or unload the entire clip in a second and a half when dealing with shields (for better overall DPS) and you have a gun with unparalleled utility.

2. Similarly, the Eviscerator/Wraith actually have a lot more potential than people give them credit for. They use the Assault Rifle damage drop-off statistics, meaning their pellets hardly lose any damage at longer ranges. Combine this with a naturally tight spread and the smart choke and you have an incredibly accurate weapon that excels at medium ranges while still retaining the shear close range stopping power of a shotgun. When firing at medium range, treat it like a heavy pistol.

3. The Katana is probably the best traditional shotgun, but the lack of utility really does hurt it overall. Still, it has a high damage per shot, a large clip, and is relatively low on weight.

**Heavy Pistols**

1. The Carnifex is simply a beast. It's probably got one of the best weight to damage ratios in the game, dealing as much damage per shot as the Saber with about half of the weight. The trade off is slightly lower accuracy and a relatively small clip but it's still accurate enough to get headshots at any range and with an extended barrel, those headshots will oneshot kill all basic infantry types. If you're a class that uses lots of powers, chances are you'll be best suited by a Carnifex X and nothing else. Just make sure to always aim for the head and keep in mind that the low thermal clip size combined with a low backup ammunition count means you're going to have to make frequent ammo runs.

2. The Phalanx is your best bet if you either don't have a Carnifex X (lower ranks don't give 200% cooldown reduction, I believe) or if you prefer a weapon that will allow you to engage more targets in a shorter period of time. It has low weight, exceptional accuracy, and a good balance of medium damage per shot and high refire rate. It's an exceptional sidearm if you already have a main weapon with a high weight and don't want to add onto that with a Carnifex.

1333121045.0,28,self.MECoOp,rl0hy,my Drell Adept build and some advice,36,8,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/rl0hy/my_drell_adept_build_and_some_advice/,"Strength Punishes; Speed Kills.

Take this for what it's worth.  I play mostly Drell Adept, have an N7 rating above 200 (just saying this to show that I've played a good bit...as far as I'm concerned, anyone with a rating above 100 is probably on equal footing as far as skill goes).

Spec Reave for damage reduction/ radius.  
Spec cluster grenades as you will, I balanced out damage and radius. 
Definitely max out Fitness.  Shields/movement speed.
I put 5 points in Assassin, (spec'd for power damage of course) and left the 6th rank alone so I could land 3 points in Pull.  This one is your call- I don't use Pull all that often.

My whole theory with the Drell Adept is that the developers gave you crap shields and a speed boost to indicate that you have to play a certain way to be successful.  And that style is hit and run.  Hit and run.  Remember that.

Reave everything everywhere all. the. time.  Ideally, you want another adept around to blow this up.  When situations get dicey, drop three cluster grenades at once for the same effect as a rocket.  Use them wisely otherwise, but don't neglect them- they are uber powerful and blow up Reave.  
Some example cluster grenade usages: use them in a small room; use them on a tough enemy; blanket a friend's corpse with them, rush in and revive; just got revived by a sneaky infiltrator and there are 5 phantoms dancing on your body?  carpet bomb those ninja biatches! (and then run the hell away at Mach Drell 5.)

Keep in mind that Reave knocks back all enemies except for the big baddies.  You probably want something accurate that gives you 200% cooldown.  Cast reave on an enemy or enemies, scope in, head shot them while they're stunned with a carnifex, phalanx, or avenger (or something similar).  If it's dicey, you can reave an enemy in the face (which stuns them) and peace out of there at Mach Drell 5.  You can also use this speed to run all the way across a map for an objective.  You're like a poor man's infiltrator for objectives.  Not as good, but still quite adequate in most situations.

You can be a rocket assassin when it's eliminate the targets time.  If they're normal, rush in, reave and drop a couple cluster grenades, rush out.  You'll kill lots of shit.  If they're tough, rush in and rocket the room.  

I can't imagine how Drell Adepts cope without the speed- use it and use it well.  I play on Gold all the time with this class.  Good luck!

Edit: Added the first line.

Edit: I forgot to mention that there are three good ways to deal with shielded enemies.  
First: set down Reave and have your sentinel/adept friend blow it up.  
Second: Hit them with Reave and then while they're stunned shoot their shield off- this actually works quite well.  Infiltrators who use energy drain and then get a head shot on the stunned enemy will be quite familiar with this tactic.
Third: Grenades.  Hooray, grenades.  Remember to reave first unless you're really messed up.

**Quarian (Class B)** *Rank: Red*

The second category of quarian hostiles carry an omni-tool with only two programs running on it, unlike other Engineers Cerberus has encountered. The first one, Incinerate, has been covered already. Fiery projectiles that have devastating effects if it's not expected. The second program is, in itself, one that does not directly damage enemy soldiers, but leaves them extremely vulnerable to subsequent attacks.

'Tactical Scan' has been written by quarian operatives to highlight certain targets on the field. When running, the program paints a target (chosen by the quarian) with a red glow, visible only to the quarian and its allies using their Hostile Identification and Tracking System Implant. This provides the team with useful information such as armour integrity, shield power, barrier reserves as well as allowing them to see the target through obstacles such as walls. Tactical Scan also sends out a small electrical charge combined with a minor hacking VI, which seizes up and decreases the effectiveness of Cerberus appointed armour systems, both standard-issue and reinforced Armour. If a quarian Class-B Engineer is spotted in combat, take note if suddenly all four hostiles focus fire on one target. Use this to either stay in cover or move in and flank depending on the situation.

These quarians are also trained in grenade use, releasing overwhelming electrical bombs known as Arc Grenades. Intelligence has not yet obtained an intact one, but first-hand accounts and battlefield vids have given us a basic overview of Arc Grenades' function. The grenade itself is pressure-sensitive, unlike most grenades, which means that it detonates immediately when impacting the ground, giving Cerberus troops zero time to react to the bomb. Testing our prototype Mark-II Cerberus Fragmentation Grenades using this pressure-sensitive system have resulted in failure for unknown reasons. When the Arc Grenade detonates, miniscule conductive pellets are released at high speed from the explosion. These pellets are not enough to penetrate standard combat protective gear, however this is not the intention of the Arc Grenade. The central sphere inside is extremely ionized, and, upon detonation, arcs this electrical difference into the conductive pellets now imbedded into hostile's armour. The resulting discharge sends enough electricity into enemies within the detonation radius to short out shield generators, paralyze muscles and trigger any residual tech programs affecting the target's at the time. A common strategy employed by the quarian Class-B Engineer is to light one or multiple hostiles on fire with Incinerate, then detonate this with a well-placed Arc Grenade.

Like the quarian Class-A Engineer, the Class-B relies heavily on its shields to protect it from gunfire, so common tactics lean toward spreading out and focusing fire. The quarians also managed to find a way to be unaffected by their own Arc Grenades, whether they stop the conductive pellets or dissipate the electrical difference has not been determined, so be wary upon approach. A startled quarian Class-B Engineer has been known to drop an Arc Grenade at its feet and flee in the chaos.

**Human (Class-B)** *Rank: Red*

Another division of the Interplanetary Combatives Academy in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Earth, the human Class-B Engineer is a walking destructive force on the battleground. An explosives expert, this Engineer is a one person demolition squad. Often times, Cerberus operatives bunkered down in local domiciles and constructions have been eliminated by the class-B human Engineer bringing the entire building down to the ground.

This Interplanetary Combatives Academy truly lives up to its name by accepting aliens as valid instructors and tacticians. Quarian technicians have relinquished the Arc Grenade schematic to the Academy, trusting them to keep this volatile voltaic explosive safe. So far, it has not been found by Cerberus double agents, but time is on our side. Human Class-B Engineers have carried the Arc Grenades into battle alongside their quarian allies, and used them just as effectively.

Using the Fragmentation Grenade popularized by the various Human Soldiers, the human Class-B Engineer has modified it to fit their tactical approach to a firefight. With these few modifications, the newly dubbed 'Homing Grenade' uses power, and is fired, from the omni-tool, and also relies on the information given by the Hostile Identification and Tracking System Implant to seek and destroy specific targets. Depending on each Engineer, these grenades can carry an incendiary payload, armour-penetrating shrapnel or the ability to split into two separate grenades to explode on two targets simultaneously.

As previous skirmishes and training drills have shown, grenades are often used sparingly due to soldiers only carrying one or two, exceptions being the Atlas Infantry Fighting Exoskeleton and Centurion officers who carry smoke grenades in addition to standard issue fragmentation grenades. Common sense dictates that an effective strategy to combating the human Class-B Engineer is to simply avoid the grenades, wait until they're out, and then move in for the kill. Unfortunately, the Engineer can deploy a All-Terrain Expandable Fabrication Mechanism, shortened to 'Supply Pylon'. Seemingly diverged from the initial pylon design that our Cerberus Mass Accelerator Equipped Armoured Turret started from, the Supply Pylon gives the Engineer an apparently never-ending stock of grenades to throw. Exactly how many grenades can be manufactured is unknown, but it has been found to be more than enough to wipe out a platoon before packing up and moving. 

An additional leg of the Cerberus Advanced-Training Obstacle Course has been added to counteract this specialized demolition expert. In order to move and flank, Cerberus trainees are forced to dodge low-yield concussive grenades while attempting to be the first to cross the line in a waist-high maze. This is to improve basic movements on the battlefield while keeping an eye on ballistic trajectories of a grenade, as a human Class-B Engineer with a Supply Pylon will not attempt to out-manoeuvre their adversaries, but simply overwhelm them into submission.

**Volus** *Rank:Red*

Biotic-lacking volus tend to, much like the salarians, use cutting-edge technology to offset their stature in combat. Volus have a few advantages compared to the salarians, however. They are a smaller target, can recharge their shield on a whim with Shield Boost, and are often underestimated by their opponents.

The volus Engineer seems to have taken a page from the human Class-B Engineer's book, but uses mines instead of grenades. These two mines, Proximity and Recon, are mechanically complex enough for omni-tools to manage only 1 of each on the field at a time. 

Proximity Mine is a basic mine, exploding whenever an enemy-tagged presence is detected within a certain range. Certain modifications are used to either damage armour hydraulics, limiting mobility, or to deteriorate the armour itself, rendering following attacks and gunfire more effective. Rookie Cerberus troopers are reminded to always be aware on the battlefield in order to avoid these deathtraps.

The Recon Mine has been deployed by the volus Engineers since before the Reaper Wars began, and Cerberus agents monitoring inter-species relations between the volus and the hanar have been following a trail that reveals that the volus are negotiating an extremely lucrative deal for the schematics of this mine to the Spec Ops program located on Kahje. This mine, like the name suggests, focuses less on sudden, unexpected detonations but instead is used as an extremely useful tool to monitor the battlefield from a safe location. A few seconds after deployment, the Recon Mine sends out a penetrating laser field that operates much like the quarian Class-B Engineer's Tactical Scan. Enemies in this field are painted red in the volus' and his allies' optics through obstacles. The laser itself can be tweaked to either affect protective combat gear enough to limit mobility as well as the protection it offers. This mine, instead of automatically being triggered, is manually set off by the volus Engineer's omni-tool and this explosion has a very large radius and can be directed to penetrate hardened Armour.

The volus Engineer relies on disabling his adversaries, and finishing them off using the various guns they wield, instead of overwhelming them with sheer force. Due to Recon Mine's target-painting effects, never assume you can catch one unprepared, it has probably tracked you from the moment your boots touched the ground.

**Turian** *Rank: Red*

In turian society, the engineers design and maintain the engineering needs of all facets of life. They are responsible for schools, spaceports and power stations, among other things. These turians, now ready for frontline combat, have not had the time to develop their own devices or programs to introduce to the fight, but instead master their allies' tactics and compliment them with their rigid and extensive skills learned from the turian military. 

From the quarians, the turian Engineer carries a Sentry Turret into battle, outfitted with a flamethrower, minor pulse cannon, armour-penetrating or possible cryo ammunition, and short-range electrical discharge. This distracting device allows the turian to focus on basic military precise gunfire to take down its enemies.

From the humans, the turian Engineer has acquired the schematics to the Homing Grenade from the Interplanetary Combatives Academy. Used in conjunction with the Sentry Turret allows the turian to fire off the tracking explosives unmolested. Atlas Exoskeleton pilots and Dragoons are advised to avoid the Homing Grenades if possible, as they are often loaded with anti-armour payloads. 

Finally, again from the quarians, the turian Engineer has a Sabotage program available on its omni-tool. Upon initiation, the Sabotage program sneaks past most firewalls, ours included, and recalibrates the Friend Or Foe target detection system in our tech devices. Too many talented Combat Engineers have been killed with the very Turrets they have deployed. This also has an overloading effect on small, handheld weapons, and, if the Engineer changes the program a certain way, can leave those affected vulnerable to subsequent attacks.

Turian Engineers are solid combatants that can take as much as they give. Even the slow and steady advance of a phalanx of Guardians is not enough to break a turian's concentration in the midst of a shootout. Their last shot is just as steady and deadly as their first. An old saying says that the only way to see a turian's back is if they're dead. We at Cerberus view it the other way around. The only way to kill a turian is to see its back. Flanking and suppressive fire, not giving the turian Engineer time to set up a Sentry Turret or to see approaching Cerberus Assault Troopers is an extremely effective way to eliminate these warmongers.

**Vorcha** *Rank: Red*

The vorcha have flown under Cerberus' radar for far too long. Them siding with the Alliance has shown how far Earth's military have fallen. The rats of Omega now fight with humans. Extremely aggressive and short-lived, the vorcha hack and slash their way through their enemies, falling and recovering as much as their regenerative abilities can handle.

Surprisingly, there are vorcha with an understanding of technical gear and programs to be designated 'Engineer'. Most other species have to be trained longer than certain vorcha's life spans in order to see battle. Similar to the turian Engineer, the vorcha need the advancements of other species to wage warfare in the same capacity. They run one of the most basic programs on their omni-tools, Incinerate, coinciding with the species' tendencies to use flame and fire on the battlefield.

Somehow, even though batarians are often extremely distrustful of other species, the vorcha Engineers have obtained the 'Submission Net' from the batarian Sentinels. A web, launched from the vorcha's omni-tool, snare and subdue targets in the electrically charged strands. It is a relatively slow projectile, easily dodged by a combat roll, but even if only grazed by the web can cause the entire Submission Net to wrap around the victim. Cerberus operatives are advised to be aware when a vorcha Engineer is present, as the Submission Net can also be placed on a wall or floor by itself, waiting to entrap the first person to trigger the threads. 

The vorcha, as a species, have the ability to regenerate lost tissue using non-differentiated cells located in various spots in their body. This usually allow the vorcha to repair localized trauma and other grievous injuries within a week or two. Using a recently synthesized drug known as 'Bloodlust', specifically tailored to a vorcha's biology, these cells' mitochondria have been granted a higher ability to process fuel into energy and have managed to increase the vorcha's speed of healing into seconds. If the vorcha breathes, it will come back and kill you. Give the vorcha no quarter, and put them down like vermin. Once brought low, use the neck-stomp execution taught in Cerberus Basic Training to end this manic monster once and for all.",[Story Time],False,self,t5_2tkk1,1376777773.0,,Xbox,True,t3_1kj5kn,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1kj5kn/the_official_cerberus_handbook_chapter_22/,

1371455782.0,29,self.MECoOp,1gi63w,Phasic Ammo Discussion,32,3,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1gi63w/phasic_ammo_discussion/,"###Introduction

I'd like to talk about Phasic Rounds.  Everyone knows you use Phasic Rounds with single-shot snipers to deal with shield gate (see my post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16zcwq/me_coop_college_501_making_the_jump_to_gold/) for more info on shield gate).  What I don't think as many people realize is how good Phasic Ammo can be on many other setups.  This discussion is rather in-depth, so I hope you'll bear with me.

For the sake of this discussion, I'm going to focus on Phasic III, but the same principles hold for lower levels as well.  As a reminder, Phasic Ammo III does 15% bonus damage, with 10x damage against shields / barriers.  So, against those defenses, it gets a 150% bonus.  This damage bonus is applied to the *base* damage of the weapon you are using, so all of the equipment / passives, etc. are not counted towards the ammo damage bonus.  Note, though, that the TC multiplicative bonus is still applied to ammo, as is the multiplicative bonus for Geth weapons on Geth characters.

###Thesis

The general principle of what makes Phasic Ammo so good (with the right builds) is this:  a high percentage of the defenses you apply weapons damage to during a match are either shields or barriers, and Phasic Ammo does so much more damage to these defenses than other ammo types that it more than makes up for its modest 15% damage bonus to health / armor. 

That may sound obvious or dubious, depending on your experiences with Phasic, but let's look at it more closely with some numbers.  Let's say that, hypothetically, you aren't using any powers in a match, and you're just firing your weapon.  Let's also assume that 50% of the defenses in the match are shields / barriers, and the remaining half is split 50/50 between health / armor.  In that scenario, you'd be getting a 150% bonus half of the time, and an effective 7.5% bonus the other half.  So total bonus is `150% * 0.5 + 7.5% * 0.5 = 80%`.  Compare that to Warp IV, which does 60% bonus damage (against enemies that are not primed biotically and not against shields), and Phasic stacks up quite favorably.

Now, I'm sure you're saying, 'Well, of course you aren't *just* firing your weapon in a match; lots of classes have powers that strip shields, and biotics are better off with Warp Ammo.'  That is all true, but I'm not talking about using this with shield-stripping or biotic classes.  I'm more focused on weapons-based classes like Soldiers and Infiltrators.  Given that's the case, let's just look at an example to suss out how big of a difference it actually makes.

I'm assuming in the example below that, on average, enemies with shields / barriers tend to have them distributed 50/50 with health / armor.  I'm also assuming charged shots on the Graal, as it makes the difference a little more obvious because it allows for one-hit kills on many more enemies.

##[Turian Havoc Example](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/TurianHavoc/RAPNR/GraalSpike10AO5AP5//ShotgunRailAmp3///)

This is actually the first build I noticed in-game how much of a benefit Phasic Ammo can have (mostly because I was out of all my other Ammo at the time).  On this build, the Havoc does 2442 damage with the Graal without ammo.  With Phasic III, against shields / barriers, it does an additional `1.5 * 1320 = 1920` damage for a total of 4422.  Compare that to Warp IV, which does ~~0.6 * 1320 + 2442 = 3234 against shields~~ no extra damage against shields, and `1.2 * 1320 + 2442 = 4026` against barriers.  Against health, Phasic does an additional 198 damage and Warp IV does 792.

Thus, for this specific build, Phasic III allows one-body-shot kills on Gold Centurions, Engineers, Hunters, and Geth Bombers, whereas Warp IV can not.  Compared to Warp III, Phasic III will additionally be able to one-shot kill Nemeses, Marauders, and Collector Captains.

Phasic does not get a damage bonus against armor, but still, because of the large shield / barrier bonus, Phasic rounds come out quite well.  Against a boss like a Gold Atlas, Phasic III will take 14 shots to kill, and Warp III / IV will take 17.  Against a Gold Banshee, Phasic III takes 9 shots, Warp IV takes 8, and Warp III takes 9.

Against purely armored enemies like Brutes, Phasic is clearly not going to be the best option.  But how bad is it, really?  If you switch this build to using an Arc Pistol (for more efficient damage application / less overkill), it would take about 30% longer to kill a Brute With Phasic III than with Warp IV.  Compared to Warp III, it would only take about 18% longer to kill.

###Further Discussion

I am sure you are thinking that this hinges on quite a few assumptions, and you're right, it does.  As I already stated, if you're playing with a shield-stripping power like Overload, using Phasic isn't going to do much for you.  And on a biotic class, Warp Ammo is usually the best choice.  In addition, you probably have teammates that are also firing at enemies, and they may have shield-stripping powers, or weapons like the Reegar or Talon which quickly eradicate shields.  So, if you are playing in close proximity to such players, then Phasic Ammo is going to have less relative value.

But... if you play somewhat independently or your teammates just aren't that powerful, Phasic can be immensely helpful.  On the Havoc build above, against most Gold lower-tier enemies, Phasic III does roughly 30% more effective damage than Warp IV against shielded enemies, and roughly 50% more than Warp III.

###Other Observations

* Phasic is going to be most effective against Cerberus / Geth, a mixed bag against Collectors, and not particularly good for Reapers.

* One nice feature of Phasic ammo is that it delays the recharge on enemies' shields / barriers.  That is particularly nice for dealing with enemies like Banshees, who have a tendency to recharge barriers as they teleport around the map.

* Stripping the shields of most enemies will stagger them, and Phasic allows you to reach this stagger threshold much quicker.

* The more weapons damage bonuses your build has, the less impact ammos have on your damage output.  The differences between Warp III/IV and Phasic III can sort of melt away on some Infiltrator builds when using low to moderate damage-per-bullet weapons.

* Phasic Ammo may not be feasible on a lot of builds that need to use an ammo with AP ability to maximize damage.  Weapons like the PPR come to mind.

* Phasic is less likely to be helfpul at lower difficulties where a lower proportion of enemies have shields / barriers.  But then again, you probably don't need high-level equipment at these difficulties.

* For the average Gold+ lower-tier enemy with shields, Phasic is going to do more effective damage on enemies that have 1/3 of their shields or more remaining, when compared to Warp IV.  Against lower-tier enemies with barriers, Phasic will do better when they have more than 50% barriers remaining.  This somewhat mitigates the problem of teams applying damage to enemies before you can take advantage of your Phasic ammo.

###Conclusion

I'm not arguing you should put Phasic Ammo on all (or even most) of your classes, but I think it's a very viable alternative for weapons-based builds.  Most of this discussion has focused on comparing it to Warp IV or Warp III, which are two of the best Ammos in the game, and for the most part, Phasic Ammo has come out favorably.  Phasic isn't the right ammo all the time, but given the right circumstances, it can be a comparable, or an even superior alternative.  And, if you're short on your other III-IV Warp, Incendiary, or AP and have built up a stockpile of Phasic III, it is going to make for a very good alternative to most level II equipment.

This isn't theorycrafting.  Through gameplay, I've decided I highly prefer Phasic on a lot of builds, even when it doesn't seem obvious.  I've been called out for using Phasic on projectile weapons, but those are often the best times to use it - you don't need any AP benefit from AP or Warp ammo, and Phasic isn't just about bypassing shield gate.  It simply does more effective damage against many lower-tier enemies.

Give it a try against Geth with the Havoc or the Human Infiltrator, and see how much of a difference it makes compared to the alternatives.  It's really quite noticeable.  Those aren't the only classes where it makes sense, but it is probably most noticeable on those ones.

Anyway, I apologize if this post was a little dense, but I figured it was worth making because I almost never see anyone using Phasic Ammo on anything other than Javelin / Black Widow, etc. builds, and I think it has a lot more utility than that.

It's neither the site nor the mods (though on occasion we wish it was true) that make this place great. It's the people involved that make this place great.

So you want to get involved. One of the ways to get involved is to ""teach"" (make a post) a course in the [Co-Op College](http://www.reddit.com/r/mecoop/wiki/college), which is a wiki of sorts. I think this is the easiest way for players old and new alike to find useful and factual information without slogging through all of BSN and the number crunching. For example, perhaps you want to know how to deal with [Cerberus](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16lprb/me3_coop_college_203_cerberus/) cleanly and effectively. Maybe you want to be a better player on a map you stink at like [Vancouver](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1884uf/me_coop_college_maps_303_firebase_vancouver/). It may even be possible that you have no idea how [grenades](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/194k9r/me3_coop_college_604_grenades/) work in this game (to be fair some of those grenades are darn complicated). All of these posts are examples of the mini-wiki we have succeeding in delivering factual, concise(-ish) information that is readily available for anyone to see.

Really, I'm asking you readers to help finish out this wiki. We are still missing a few, important articles that will benefit many readers.

* To start out with, the 300 series involves maps. We are still missing the maps **Dagger**, **White**, **Giant**, **Condor**, **Jade**, **Goddess**, **Rio**, and **London**. Keep in mind if the map has a hazard variant that the hazard should be included in the guide. It would also be nice to have a post regarding the different **operations** present during objective waves in the game.

* The 400 series deals with equipment and I think it's nearly rounded out. If there were posts that involved **weapon amps** and **armor modules** (both of which are fairly straightforward as nearly all of them are straight up additive bonuses), it would be much appreciated.

* The 500 series involves tips and tricks that are less than obvious to the average player. If you feel that there is a missing trick we have not covered, feel free to add one. Perhaps even involve it as a part of the [video demonstrations](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/18vzrr/mecoop_college_tips_and_tricks_505_video/) post. By the end of this week I'll repost that post so that you don't need to bother UnholyDemigod about it.

* Finally, the 600 series revolves around powers and boy do we have a big gap there. We still need a post regarding **Tech Powers** and **Biotic Powers**. Considering the number of powers that need to be covered, I think it would be a good idea to break Tech down into **Fire &amp; Ice** and **Lightning** powers, as well as having Biotics being subdivided somehow. Currently I am thinking that Biotics should be subdivided into **Primers** and **Detonators**, but the line is blurry there as many primers are also detonators.

###PSA

****

Sup, suckas?

So I've been doing a lot of messing around with our friend the ~~MURDERTRAIN~~ Kroguard, and I thought... This build I've been telling you guys is crap. Utter, bullish, crap.

Let me give you a brand new one, that's ~~MILES~~ STREETS ahead.

****
###THE BUILD

****

http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Vanguard/KroganBattlemaster/AOMPR/NTyphoon10BF5AD5//TargetingVI3/StabilizationModule4/VulnerabilityVI5/

So there you go.  We're speccing out of Biotic Charge, and giving a lot of power to Carnage, the one true power.  Carnage has a slow recharge, but it won't matter because you're going to be doing so much damage with it.

The way this build is played, is cowering behind some cover, waiting for Carnage to come back as quickly as possible.  Since you're going to be waiting for that cooldown, we're taking the Typhoon with to lay down some cover fire until we get our skill back.

We spec Barrier for Power damage.  We don't need durability.  We're hiding behind desks, remember? That's MORE than enough for us.

I only took 'fitness' upgrades, because I didn't want to take Biotic Charge.  It's such a terrible skill.  So you may as well take more shields.  If something gets close enough to you to where you have to melee, you've done something wrong.


****
###CONCLUSION

****

For almost a year, I've told you guys what to do with the Kroguard.  I'm so sorry I led you astray.  Just respec to Carnage, and thank me later.

Just don't give up on it.  It won't let you down.

Here's some gameplay of me using this new build.

The Krogan Warlord has, within 3 hours, become my favorite class of Mass Effect 3. You're going to see just why.

**ALRIGHT, CRETINS, HERE'S WHY THE HAMMERLORD WILL KICK THE ASS OF YOUR FOES SO HARD THEIR ASSES WILL INVARIABLY FLY INTO OTHER ASSES, CREATING A ASS-KICKING-DOMINO EFFECT.**

The Krogan Warlord plays like no other class. You've got limited mobility, but heavy defenses to make up for that. Because you're just as tall as the Geth Juggernaut (and thus, Primes as well), you can't take cover. You also can't dodge or slide over cover as a result (but you can sprint), which makes some maps tricky to navigate due to large amounts of cover. If you're going to use any armor equipment, *use an Adrenaline Module*. 

On the bright side, you're a tank. Regardless of whether or not you spec in survivability, you're going to soak up damage like a sponge to water. Only the water is energy blasts and rockets, and the Krogan Warlord is a sponge **(MY SKILL WITH METAPHORS IS UNMATCHED).** 

When you kill an enemy with a melee attack, you're going to enter **WARLORD RAGE!!** What makes **WARLORD RAGE!!** so powerful is that you're not only going to be doling out more melee damage, but you're also going to regenerate health like a Vorcha. If you can keep a streak of kills going with your hammer, you're going to be very difficult to kill.

**THE WARLORD IS BUILT EXCLUSIVELY FOR A MELEE-FOCUSED PLAYSTYLE, AND PLAYING IT IN ANY OTHER WAY IS THE *WORST IDEA SINCE KROGAN BABYSITTERS*.**

Now that we've clarified that you should have the primal urge to smash things into Cerberus/Geth/Reaper/Collector-sized bits, let's discuss how the Krogan Warlord uses melee attacks. **EDIT:** While using a melee attack, the Warlord receives a pretty hefty bonus to damage resistance (approximately 80%). If using Tech Armor while enraged, you'll be taking very little damage while using melee. Another unique thing about the Krogan Warlord is his selection of possible melee attacks- 4, to be exact:

* Standing still, light melee: Headbutt! Being a traditional Krogan greeting, farewell, embrace, attack, comfort, and put-down, it only makes sense that your most basic attack is this Krogan sign of (dis)approval. With this attack, you can kill most mooks in one to two hits. If that didn't do the job, you can press light melee again to strike again with your hammer! If the tenacious bastard is still standing, the final swing from your hammer should put them down for good, decapitating them in the process (this is *not* a reliable way to kill abominations, so don't risk it). 

**EDIT:** A fun sidenote: the third swing detonates your current charge, so you can use this against enemies to take advantage of the Hammerlord's increased DR when melee-attacking. Plus, it looks absolutely badass to hit an enemy with a Biotic Hammer and watch them fly away. Bonus points for screaming, ""HOME RUN!""

* Standing still, heavy melee: Drop the hammer! No, really. You're going to take the hammer of your back, quickly slam it into the ground (it's about as long as your average heavy melee), and put it back where it was beforehand. If you're using a charge (see below), you're going to expend one of those charges. Oh right, and it's incredibly powerful, able to tear *chunks* of armor off of bosses. You can still be grabbed or insta-killed by bosses, so watch out. You should have no issue tearing a Geth Prime or Atlas Mech to shreds, however. 

* Moving, light melee: It's the Krogan salute, the headbutt. It's the same as if you were standing still, and you can still do the three-hit combo with it.

* Storming, heavy melee: Charging headbutt! If you want to take down a Geth Rocket Trooper or Centurion, this is a great way to do it without risking much. On lower difficulties, most enemies will die instantly, while you may want to follow up with a couple shots from your gun, or a light melee.

**A TRUE WARLORD'S SIDEARM IS HIS PRIMARY WEAPON.**

If you want to try a gun-focused Sentinel, go find a new class. The Warlord's weapon of choice should always be his hammer (and forehead), so your gun is definitely a second-thought. You're going to want a gun that can take down enemies that can't be taken down by melee attacks (Guardians are *impossibly* durable to your hammer), or pose a threat in numbers. Bosses can be taken down with melee, but you're going to want something meaty to tear chunks out of enemies. Because your skills allow you to reduce a shotgun's weight by a large margin, a weapon like the Venom (the charged shot drops 3 grenades, which are very handy for getting behind a Guardian) or the Claymore (for punching through armor from a distance) are very good choices. 

Even if you don't want a shotgun, you want something that hits hard. If you're going with an assault rifle, use Ultra-Lightweight Materials, and no matter what gun you're using, *always use the blade attachment*. That extra melee damage will go miles towards helping you deal with enemies.

**YOUR SKILLS SHOULD REFLECT BEING ABLE TO CRUSH, MAIM, AND *NOT DIE*.**

This means Tech Armor is a must, and you should only focus on one Hammer-charge (Electric gives you an AOE effect, while Biotic gives you a massive damage boost; both detonate explosions). The Electric Hammer is my personal recommendation, as your Tech Armor can be detonated to set enemies up for a Tech Explosion. The Electric Hammer wraps it up nicely.

You should already know how to spec Tech Armor for the Warlord (whatever you can use to get maximum melee damage), though the final evolution is up to you (I recommend durability if you're using shotguns, as another Warlord skill lets you reduce weight on shotties significantly; if you're using anything else, take your pick). Keep Tech Armor up at all times, unless you're dealing with someone who is giving you enough trouble that you just want to hit them with the hardest hammer slam you can.

~~*Only choose one hammer type*~~. Using both hammers is a viable strategy. It's recommended that you forgo the Krogan Warlord tree if you do. If you want to take down armored foes, use the Biotic Hammer. It's far more helpful on a team of biotics (you won't be able to detonate biotic explosions), but you can reliably tear bosses to bits with one strike of this. The big issue here is that you're only getting one charge (unless you choose to spec with two), with a long cooldown awaiting you. As a result, you should always use this power when you're not in battle, so you can charge it again in cover during a firefight. 

**EDIT:** You can cancel the animation for charging your hammer if you immediately perform a Heavy Melee attack after the ""charge circles"" appear on the weapon. Another thing to note is that you can recharge at any time, so if you have 1 charge on the Electric Hammer remaining, you can use the power again to replenish charges. 

**ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE ON HAMMER CHARGES:** When using a charge, you will deal damage in power damage, rather than melee. This means Tech Armor with power damage is possibly more capable than melee damage. Whatever floats your boat, of course, but it's nice to have a little power damage boost. You can make an incredible Electric Hammer with high power damage.

The Electric hammer can focus on a large amount of enemies, dealing AOE damage. Your level 5 evolution will let you select between Fire or Cryo damage, letting you add a little bit of DOT or immobility to your enemies. Power damage bonuses work well with either power, and you're going to want to deal the maximum amount of damage. As odd as it sounds, you're not going to want the Electric/Cryo Hammer, as you're not going to be able to melee each enemy quickly, and your gun isn't the focus here. Electric/Fire should deal enough damage to finish enemies, and a simple headbutt should keep them down for the count.

Speccing in Krogan Warlord is easy: you have no powers to benefit using a gun, so spec into capacity, power damage, and shotguns.

Warlord Rage is the tree that lets you decide: do you want to deal even more damage than usual, or soak up more damage than usual? Whatever your choice, you should spec into that. You can have insane survivability with health regen, or deal crazy amounts of hammer damage. *Either way, you should spec into Martial arts, as your regenerating health makes your shields an afterthought.*

**CLOSING WORDS ARE FOR WEAKLINGS.**

I'm still going to use them, however. Your ideal build for the Warlord should be a 6/0/6/6/6 or 6/6/0/6/6, though a 5/3/6/6/6 or 5/6/3/6/6 is perfectly viable as well. I recommend the build look something like this:

**Tech Armor:** Damage, Melee or Power (if you're not using charges often, melee; otherwise, power), Durability.

**Electric Hammer:** Shields, Fire, Radius (Charges also works, but you should always load charges when your powers are ready).

**Krogan Warlord:** Capacity, Power Damage, Shotguns.

**Warlord Rage:** Melee, Martial Artist, Fitness Expert (Durability, Martial Artist, and Pure Rage also works nicely).

**EDIT: IMPORTANT SIDENOTE!**

After some testing, I've found the Krogan Warlord tree to be a dispensable tree when using a lightweight gun, or if you care little for cooldowns. Thus, a 6/6/6/0/6 tree, or even 3 points in Krogan Warlord and 5 in another are a very good strategy. The Disciple is also very useful.

**EDIT: [BUILD ON CHARACTER CREATOR!](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Sentinel/KroganWarlord/RMKAP/Disciple10AN5AO5//StrengthEnhancer3/AdrenalineModule4/JuggernautShield5/)** 

Note: Suggested build in the character creator contains very high level equipment even I do not have (or use). Adrenaline Module at II or III is just fine, and the Strength Enhancer at I or II is also great. The Juggernaut Shield is ideal at around II or III, but even better as you go up.

The Warlord is a complex class that is very versatile. You can go melee or tank, and either way, your hammer's powers make you a very helpful class for support. Detonate explosions, detonate your enemy's faces (that's a joke relative to the force of your hamm- ah, forget it), or a combination of both.

**LIVE LONG, SMASH STRONG!**

The Turian Colony Invictus has always lived true to it's Latin nomenclature; it's tropical belt has been unconquered by the planets foreign inhabitants and rife with virulence and chaos. Of course, the same could be said of the colonists who to this day remain fully unvanquished by the planet, or the impending Reaper rapture. Thus, it only makes sense that the Hierarchy would find a brutal new fighting force to strike back against the Reapers on this very Planet.

From within the Lush Jungle which claimed so many colonists and has been avoided for generations now sprang forth a group of Turians unlike any that had been seen prior. A remnant of the Unification war over two thousand years ago, The Caliguli, a clan of defeated Turians, fled the Hierarchy and landed on then uncharted Invictus. They nearly died on that planet like many Colonists later would, but instead of fleeing or avoiding the jungle, they embraced it and adapted. Of the some 5000 Turian refugees that landed there, only 1000 lived into the next generation, but surprisingly, a rare genetic marker in the survivors left 900 of those being females. This caused a truly remarkable shift in the new Turian Culture that formed on Invictus. Females, outnumbering males 9 to 1, began safeguarding them for reproduction and became the most agile and adept at fighting for survival in the wilderness. These females became masters of the local toxicology employed by local predators and the best amplified their biotics by selectively breeding with only other Turian biotics in the group. 

At the time of the reaper invasion, the presence of these Turian jungle warriors was still unknown to the general public on the planet but had swelled to a 200,000 strong with a consistent 9 to 1 ratio of female to males. They were in fact the real reason colonizing was nearly impossible as they'd capture many colonists in order to keep anonymity among the other Jungle predators. 

When the reapers came, the Hierarchy offered to cede the entire planet to the Caliguli Cabal in exchange for their assistance with tactics unknown to the rest of the galaxy. In truly Turian fashion the Hierarchy would abandon one colony in order to save the rest of the Hierarchy. Now the Caliguili wield a venomous vengeance against a force that they realize threatens even them.

*Poison Strike*: SKIP IT!

That's right no charge on this Vanguard, and that means no Poison Strike as well. I'm doing this for two reasons: 

1.  It doesn't refill your barriers like charge so the risk reward isn't equal like charge. 

2. The power doesn't lock on, is one directional, and seems to have a narrow radius which causes you to miss often; it's a pain in the Cloaca to use. 

I love the idea of it, and I'm sure there will be successful builds that take full advantage of it since it is rather unique as a gameplay mechanic for ME3, it's just not for me.

1. Rank 4A Damage over Capacity. With Grenade Gear you'll definitely want that extra 30% damage on top of it's already crazy base damage. That also increases the DoT which has helped me take down phantoms so far. If the capacity was an increase by two, I'd think about it, but at this point damage is the only way to go

2. Rank 5B Poison Duration over Range. This was the toughest choice for me as range, like ballistic blades, makes the damage decrease less the farther away the target is and would grant more utility. However unlike ballistic blades, this is a grenade based power which I can fire off quickly if I need more damage. The duration will help paralyze organics longer so they die from DoT and don't shoot you. 

3. Rank 6A Enhanced Blades over Exploding blades. The Enhanced Blades combined with the passive combination I'm going to take later brings the upfront damage to nearly 3000, and adds on about 1250 Dot over the next 11 seconds. That's quite the kick that can be fired off anytime as long as you have grenades. Exploding Blades, while also excellent, does less over all damage and I wont need the stagger as the Venom will take care of that.

*Biotic Focus*: All the way for the panic button 

1. Rank 4A Damage Taken over Movement Speed. The total decrease in damage taken in Biotic Focus will be -25%. That's significant and will allow you take take a hit better than most soldiers when combined with fitness. Also, you have an amazing dodge that is quicker than the Fury's or Slayer's. Using that smartly should make up for not taking the extra movement speed boost. 

2. Rank 5A Duration over Melee Damage. If something gets close to you, you blade it, shoot it, and it will be dead or crying. With this Weapons platform style you wont need to be using melee very often unless you're finishing someone off with style (it is very stylish). Duration on the other hand lets you stay in your enhanced state longer so you aren't fussing with it instead of shooting or blading. 

3. Rank 6A Biotic Shield over Heighten focus. This was a tough decision as this is a very balanced Rank 6 Choice. I ultimately went with the Shield for that invulnerability which can allow you to tank Atlas rockets and Banshee warp balls while instantly starting some barrier regeneration. Also the bottom evolution would be better for a melee build, which this is not (we've got the new Krogan for that).

**Passives and Fitness**

The Cabal was blessed with the Base Turian passives which make for the crux of this build. She can wield the unwieldy. 

1. I went 4A Damage and Stability to boost your Hurricane and  

2. Next I chose Rank 5B headshots. It is definitely useful for the Blood Pack Punisher as nothing feels more satisfying than an armor piercing slug to the head.... if you're firing it. 

3. To make landing those headshots easier and to add that extra punch I went Damage and stability as weight isn't much of a factor since I'm not poison striking and Blades are grenade based with her.

*Fitness*: This ain't no melee build! Health and shields all the way! You want to tank for crappy bugs all day right?

**Weapons and Gear**

1. To stick with the theme, I've chosen the Venom. The staggering ability and high damage lends itself well to the aggressive style that the Cabal encourages. Damage and ammo mods work well as other mods wont have an effect and you aren't to concerned about weight here.

2. Along with that you should bring the Hurricane for single target DPS which She can fully take advantage of with her passives. The power amplifier, armor piercing barrel, or Heat Sink are all good choices with this build.

3. Shock Trooper or grenade Gear will allow you to use the Blades with impunity. You aren't fragile and are considerably mobile so you don't need any other gear but Adrenaline modules, Stabilization modules, or Cyclonics are always nice. Warp ammo is my go to ammo Since I'm not trying to self-detonate explosions.",[Build],False,self,t5_2tkk1,1362192987.0,,Xbox,True,t3_199xts,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/199xts/the_turian_cabal_invictus_queen_cobra/,
1361696531.0,30,self.MECoOp,194k9r,ME3 Co-Op College 604: Grenades,36,6,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/194k9r/me3_coop_college_604_grenades/,"In this installment of the ME3 Co-Op College, you will learn how to use and abuse the powerhouse power that is the grenade. Moderately powerful in ME1, nearly absent in ME2, and now prevelant in ME3, grenades are a powerful and disposable tool in any operative's arsenal. While in ME1 they were discs that can be upgraded to include different effects, grenades in ME3 take a wide variety of shapes, form, and functions. Some grenades perform better in saturating an area with damage, some are great in 
dislodging enemies from cover, and some are great to hit a single target really hard. There's also Stimulant Packs, which is not a grenade but given that it also shares the capacity requirement of grenades it is included in this post as well.

Grenades are powers and as such benefit from power damage upgrades in the passive upgrades. Grenades also don't depend on power cooldown and instead depend on grenade capacity to be used. This means that you can use grenades in Tactical Cloak without breaking it, in Adrenaline Rush, and while Biotic Charge is recharging. 

All grenades (sans Inferno Grenades) can detonate Power Combos of some form. The center of these detonations (such as an Arc Grenade detonating a Fire Explosion) is centered around the location of the grenade detonation, not the target that is priming said Power Combo.

On the downside grenade explosions also cause screen shake, which will annoy sharpshooters on your team. Keep that in mind when using many grenades in succession.

Which brings up the topic of grenade capacity. Grenade capacity determines how many grenades you can carry through battle. 
Speccing one point (Rank 1) into a grenade will grant 1 grenade, while Rank 2 will grant another grenade. Beyond that, Rank 5 top evolution (evolution 3) will grant one (Homing, Stim, Arc) or two (Frag, Multi-Frag, Sticky, Inferno, Cluster, Lift) grenades to use. In 
addition, Grenade Capacity, Warfighter Package, and Shock Trooper Upgrade gear can also add extra grenade capacity. Finally, the N7 Demolisher (a grenade specialist) has her passive granting her additional grenade capacity. 

There are two ways to ""recharge"" grenades. The first is grabbing grenades (small grey/black cans) in an ammo box or Supply Pylon. Most ammo boxes should give two grenades per box but a few of the older maps (Dagger, Glacier, Giant, Reactor | Hazard variants should grant two grenades per box) still only grant one grenade per box. On Bronze, each grenade in a box/Pylon counts as two towards your grenade capacity instead of the normal one grenade in box to one grenade to capacity on the other difficulties. The second method is using a Thermal Clip Pack consumable to restore up to 10 grenades. Using a Thermal Clip Pack will not restore beyond the 10 grenade limit (only an issue on a Demolisher maxing out grenade capacity).

When it comes to upgrades, all grenades can be upgraded to improve the damage and radius of the grenade and can increase capacity at Rank 5. Thus, those upgrades will be considered ignored when talking about the unique aspects of grenades. The grenades will follow this format for the rest of the guide.

**Grenade Type (Users) (Type of power)**

Description of the grenade and how it works

Interesting Evolutions of note

My note on how the grenade works
_________________________________________


**Frag Grenades (Human Soldier/BF3 Soldier) (Combat)**

Frag Grenade sends a high explosive fragmentation grenade that bounces around before detonating. This power also detonates upon contact of enemy. It possesses a flat long arc and thus easy to aim. Frag Grenades have a base force of 1500N. Frag Grenades set the operating precedent for many other grenades, so if there isn't a descriptor about arcing or explosive nature assume it operates like Frag Grenades.

Frag Grenades can be evolved to deal bleed damage to organics (a la Shredder evolution for Concussive Shot) at Rank 5 and can be given a Shield/Armor damage modifier at Rank 6. Unfortunately the rank 6 evos are bugged to deal 1.5x damage, not the 1.75x that they should do.  (social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15290732/1)

Overall a balanced grenade and has no particular weakness. In particular, it is great for crowd control due to its excellent 
radius. Bouncing off of walls is an excellent technique to send the grenade beyond LoS and can save your squad in times of need. 

________________________________________

**Multi-Frag Grenades (N7 Destroyer Soldier) (Combat)**

Multi-Frag Grenades send three miniature frag grenades out of the hand. They start out clustered together and split apart as they go farther they travel. Unlike Frag Grenades, Multi-Frag Grenades detonate upon contact. 

Half of the evolutions add damage/force to each miniature frag grenade. At Rank 6, two additional miniature frag grenades can be 
added per use. It should be noted that on the power screen the damage/radius/force is for each miniature grenade.

Mutli-Frag Grenades can easily stagger bosses, even on Platinum. The grenades split is wider the farther they are launched and 
they are the best source of instant CC on the N7 Destroyer. 
_______________________________________

**Inferno Grenades (Krogan Solider/Batarian Soldier) (Combat)**

Inferno Grenades send a heavy arcing, flaming tic-tac grenade that detonates on impact, which throws 2 fragments. Each fragment (which manifests as a red flare) can hit an unlimited number of targets in a 2.5 meter radius and sets them on fire for 8 seconds. Only one DoT effect may be active on a target at a given time per grenade (stacking multiple grenades is fine) and combining with Incendiary damage shortens the burn time from 8 seconds to 3 seconds. These grenades prime for FEs and cannot detonate Tech Explosions. Enemies can only take the DoT effect if hit by the initial explosion. Inferno Grenades have a base 1.5x multiplier vs Armor and can panic organic enemies that are down to Health. 

Inferno Grenades can be specced for either crowd control with radius upgrades or nuking with higher DoT output. At Rank 6 Inferno Grenades can launch an additional fragment to set more enemies on fire or be evolved to deal additional damage to armor.

Inferno Grenades can either be geared towards hitting a swath of enemies with a large radius (9m) or geared towards Armor nuking that can waste bosses and spawns alike (~1044 damage/second vs Armor with a properly specced and equipped Krogan Soldier).

______________________________

**Sticky Grenades (Human Infiltrator/Quarian Female Infiltrator) (Combat)**

Sticky Grenades are a high explosive grenade that sticks upon landing. it detonates shortly after sticking to something  Has high 
base damage and a small radius with a base force of 1500N. [Sticky Grenades can take on ammo properties that self-explode, with 
self-explosion damage based on weapon damage.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/146wbn/unnecessarily_long_guide_sticky_fiery_boomboom_qfi/)

Has a 1.5x Armor damage modifier evolution at Rank 5 that can rival Inferno Grenades in the Armor damage department (5197 vs Armor per grenade with appropriate equipment and evolutions on a QFI). It also has a unique Proximity Mine evolution at Rank 6, which allows the grenade to act as a mine, detonating only after an enemy crosses paths with it or after 15 seconds.

Like Inferno Grenades, Sticky Grenades can be geared towards boss nuking (especially in Tactical Cloak) or for crowd control by 
cutting off routes with Proximity Mine Sticky Grenades. 

________________________________

**Arc Grenades (Quarian Male Engineer/Quarian Male Infiltrator/N7 Demolisher Engineer) (Tech)**

Arc Grenades are essentially Overload in a grenade. It sends out a large electrical burst upon impact, which can stun enemies and prime for Tech Bursts. On Quarian Males, Arc Grenades have a base 2x modifier vs Barriers/Shields. Note that the base radius on the Quarian Males are 8m, while the N7 Demolisher has 6m. Possesses a base force of 1000N.

Arc Grenades can be evolved to deal bleed damage at Rank 5 vs all targets and can evolve a 1.75x shields/armor modifier at Rank 6. 

Arc Grenades are an excellent form crowd control with large radius. Arc Grenades are also great for Bronze killstreaks by 
themselves on spawns and shield stripping with shield modifier evo. Combining Arc and Inferno Grenades on a spawn can result in 
some killstreaks with proper placement. 

_____________

**Homing Grenade (N7 Demolisher Engineer/Turian Sabotuer Engineer/Drell Infiltrator) (Tech)**

Using a Homing Grenade launches a homing projectile out of the omnitool. This projectile is launched at an angle while only curving when locked on and detonates upon impact. Like 
Sticky Grenades, they have a high base damage and a small base radius. Possesses a base force of 1000N.

Homing Grenades can be evolved to add a fire DoT effect ~~that can prime for Fire Explosions at Rank 5~~ (it does NOT prime for Fire Explosions unfortunately). They can also be given an 
Armor damage modifier at Rank 6, which adds Armor DR reduction too a la armor weakening effects such as Cryo and Warp-related 
powers/ammo. Also at Rank 6 is the ability to evolve Homing Grenades to split into two smaller grenade that do 60% damage of the original grenade each . The Split Grenades attack in a similar manner to Double Throw from the single-player, which ideally will seek different targets if possible.


Homing Grenades are a decent grenade for single target use when specced for pure damage and alright at dealing with mooks when evolved into Split Grenades. They require some finesse before getting best results as the arc can cause the grenade to hit the ceiling when indoors. Despite being a Tech power, it does not seem to allow for ""X Tech Kills"" medals nor benefit from Tech 
Vulnerability from Sabotage. 

_________________

**Cluster Grenades (Drell Adept/Drell Vanguard/Vorcha Sentinel/Batarian Slasher Adept) (Biotic)**

Using Cluster Grenades will throw 2 biotically charged fragments that carry decent damage and significant force behind them. 
Cluster Grenades can detonate any Power Combo if the target is primed for one (FE, BE, TB, CE) and have a 1.5x modifier against 
Barriers. Cluster Grenades in cover tend to start out clumped together while out of cover they start out more apart. The damage 
and force on the power screen is for each fragment.

Cluster Grenades can be evolved for additional damage and force (can break 2000N per fragment). They can also gain the ability to deal extra additive damage on top of biotically primed (e.g. targets affect by Reave) targets a la Warp Ammo at Rank 5. Finally, Cluster Grenades can be evolved to send a third fragment at Rank 6.

Cluster Grenades are a strong grenade and a great suppressor in times of need. The ability to send a large amount of damage 
through grenades and Power Combos in an area at once makes it a solid grenade in any situation. They can really screw aiming 
more-so than other grenades due to number of fragments and force.

_______________________

**Lift Grenades (Asari Vanguard/Krogan Sentinel) (Biotic)**

Using a Lift Grenade will throw a single biotically infused grenade that unleashes a shockwave upon detonating. The shockwave will lift one Health-only target, which will biotically primed for a Biotic Explosion a la Pull. Lift Grenades possess a base force of 750N and have a 1.5x modifier against Barriers.

Lift Grenades can be evolved to increase lift time at Rank 5 and slam targets after lifting takes place at Rank 6. The Slam 
evolution stuns the target on the ground for three seconds after the lift time takes place. This slam can also cause crazy physics.

The lifting aspect of this grenade rarely comes into play given how many enemies die when hit by a lift grenade when at health. 
Given how Slam sends targets down with force, a lifted target that is slammed close to the ground may bounce up significantly in a 
similar manner to how targets bounce off of walls when hit by Throw. Lift Grenades can also can explode power combos on Health-
only enemies but given the power of the grenade it usually is redundant to make the target explode. My advice is to use this 
grenade as a biotic version of Frag Grenades, although the lifting aspect can be useful from time to time.

___________________________________

**Stimulant Packs (Turian Ghost Infiltrator/Turian Havoc Soldier) (Combat)**

Using a Stim Pack will recharge and boost max shields like a Survival Ops Kit and gives a damage boost upon use that lasts 6 
seconds. Like throwing grenades, Stim Packs have a small animation to start the shield boost and gives the user a purple shield 
for the time it is in use. Using Stim Packs blurs the edge of the screen when in use.

Stim Packs can be evolved to add additional shields or more damage when active. They can also be evolved to increase the time in 
max shields mode instead of extra capacity at Rank 5. 

Stim Packs are useful for surviving as they rapidly restore shields, but be aware that taking damage when activating can cancel 
the boost. This leaves you with no immediate shields and one less Stim Pack. Use Stim Packs preemptively before a big engagement to get the best benefits and to avoid said issue.

They share one or two things in common and it's worth having their details all in one place for comparison. I'll assume you're aware of the very basics of each power, and that I can just talk about the details. Before we look at them though, let's talk about the staple of power use on high levels - power combos

##Power Combinations

I think one of the reasons that pets aren't seen as very useful on gold and platinum is that their damage doesn't scale well. While the damage of biotic explosions scales with difficulty - and therefore with enemy health - the straight damage of powers doesn't, and neither does their durability. It's pretty tricky to set up or detonate tech combos with drones and turrets, but it can be done.

The sentry turret and geth turret's flamethrowers *set up* fire explosions. Detonating them is tricky for the quarian engineer and turian saboteur. You need, as far as I can tell, to hit the enemy *while it's being roasted by the flamethrower* to detonate the combo. This is tricky for these two classes - incinerate has a travel time, and sabotage, afaict, either doesn't detonate tech combos or does it when the enemy's guns backfire - that is, 1.5 seconds after they're hit with the power. This does not make for reliable fire explosions.

The geth engineer on the other hand has no such trouble. He has the best detonating power in the game - overload. It travels instantly, but it probably won't detonate more than one fire explosion. I suspect that the flamethrower is like the vorcha flamer and only primes once per jet of flame.

The exploding decoy and exploding drone both set *off* tech combos. Notably, the shock evolutions of the pets do not set *up* tech combos, despite leaving a sparkly electrical effect on the target.

Remember that if you put 6 ranks into your drone, it counts as a rank 6 power for power combos, even if the particular aspect of the power in question (say, detonation) is at an earlier rank (say, rank 4).

##Sentry Turret

If you *really* want to know how the sentry turret operates, you ought to read this post - social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15291368 - by noted BSN egghead peddroelmz.

Key points:

* The turret chooses between shock, rockets, flamer and its gun. It can't use them simultaneously
* All the turret's attacks get boosts from power damage bonuses, but oddly, only the shock evolution benefits from sabotage's tech vulnerability
* The gun can score headshots occasionally, and suffers from the 50 damage bullet tax on gold-difficulty armour
* If you choose the AP perk on the gun, it's like equiping AP ammo. You do an extra set of damage versus health and armor and (bonus!), this set isn't affected by the 50 damage tax on gold armour.

It appears that each of the turret's attacks has a cooldown, so that when it shocks, it has to wait 2 seconds before it can decide if it wants to fire its gun or use a rocket. You might wonder whether combining a lot of attacks into one pet is therefore worthwhile.

The coalesced file has some interesting details about each of the attacks the sentry turret uses. I've updated these with what we know from the balance changes.

**The Gun**

Base damage = 75

Rate of fire: 540

(roundsperburst = 1, but we know that it fires a three round burst from the June 21st balance changes. I'm not sure what this does)

ai_burstfirecount = 3

ai_burstfiredelay = 2

ai_aimdelay = 1 (presumably the turret has a little difficulty switching to a new target)

Assume that it fires a three round burst every 2 seconds with a 540rpm rate of fire. That's 9 rounds per second, or 0.2222 seconds for each three round burst. The burst time with the refire time gives us 2.2222s, during which the turret does (75 * 3) 225 damage, or (161.25 * 3) 483.75 damage if we spec fully into damage. That's a DPS of 217.68. By comparison, the *base* DPS of the shuriken is 371.52. So we're not doing a whole lot of damage with our turret.

**Cryo Ammo**

Not strictly an attack, but it does enhance the crowd control abilities of your turret's gun. There's a variable in the coalesced file called evolve_cryofreezechange set to 0.5f (was increased by 200% in the June 21st balance changes). I have absolutely no idea how 50% can be increased by 200%. Perhaps it means something else. The freezeduration is 3 seconds, and as far as I can tell, it freezes only unshielded enemies.

**The Rockets**
 
rocketcooldown = 3 seconds (was 4)

rocketdamage = 300 (was 150)

rocketforce = 300N

rocketradius = 2.5m (was 1.5m)

minimumrange = 5m (was 10m)

maximumrange = 60m

The gun has higher damage versus single targets, but the rockets are handy for groups.

**The shock**

shockcooldown = 2s (was 5s)

shockdamage = 100

shockforce = 1000N (was 450N)

shockradius = 5m (was 2.5m)

maximumrange = 1.9m

The shock attack has fairly substantial force. Enough to staggar a gold dragoon, and enough to grab the attention of a phantom. Sadly, it does not set up tech bursts.

**The flamethrower**

Base DPS is 65. There's a value ""flamethrowerdamageduration"" set to 1.0 in the coalesced file. I'm not really sure what it does.

##Geth Turret

Popular opinion has it that this turret's gun deals more damage than that of the quarian turret. As far as I can tell, this is completely wrong.

The turret uses its ""gun"" every 3 seconds. If we spec fully into damage for this gun (power damage, hunter mode, etc), it'll do 393.75 damage per shot. 393.75 damage per shot every 3 seconds is underwhelming, even when compared to the quarian/turian sentry turret, which itself is underpowered compared to the shuriken. We're not sure whether it's affected by armour damage reduction. But even if it is, it's going to lose less of its damage to armour DR than the quarian turret.

However, the turret's gun does have one underappreciated use: it will fire in the direction of the nearest enemy, which gives you a head's up on where they're coming from if you can't find them.

**Healing** 

A feature unique among pets, the turret will heal one teammate within 8m (or 11.2m with evolution 4) of the turret every 8 seconds (or every 5 seconds with evolution 6). Sadly this does not reset the cooldown on your shieldgate, so don't get too overconfident. It will heal immediately as it's dropped. Consider using this while accompanying a drone around.

**The flamethrower**

On higher difficulties, perhaps the best use of this power is to set up fire explosions. The geth engineer has overload, a hitscan power. If he uses this on a target *while the flamer is currently roasting it*, he'll detonate the tech combo. Remember that fire explosions cannot be detonated on enemies with shields or barriers.

Unlike the geth turret's gun, the flamethrower gets its kills credited to ""sentry turret"" and likewise provides points for that challenge in tech mastery.

##Combat Drone

We'll assume that combat drone acts the same way as the sentry turret and that each of its attacks shares a cooldown (certainly, there is a cooldown listed in the balance changes and in the coalesced file for each of the drone's attacks and I've never seen a drone execute two different attacks in a short space of time). The four attacks you can spec into are: the zap (that is, the basic attack), the explosion, the shock and the rockets

If you choose the shields and damage options in ranks 4 and 5, these will increase the damage of each of the attacks.

The health of the drone is indictated by the colour of the aura surrounding it. At mid-level health it's orange. When it's about to die, it'll turn reddish.

**The Zap**

Does:

40 damage

on a 3 second cooldown

with 175N of force

with a 10m range

For chain lightning, based on what I've found in the coalesced file, I believe there are 3 extra targets, that there is a max jump distance of 10m and a 0.5 second jump delay

**The explosion**

Naturally, no cooldown

400 damage

800N force

In a 5m radius

The explosion is blocked by cover

It's worth noting that the explosion will set off tech combos.

**The shock**

3 second cooldown

100 damage

1000N of force

in a 5m radius

maximum targets is 2

With a 1.9m max range

To repeat, the shock evolution *does not* set up tech bursts. It has a fairly substantial amount of force behind it though - 1000N will staggar a phantom. I've never seen the shock staggar a prime though, so I suspect the force doesn't get benefits from the power damage bonuses in the passive (anyone confirm or deny?).

**The rockets**

3 second cooldown

300 damage

300N of force

2.5m radius

4m minimum range. 

If you equip your drone with rockets, you'll often see it move away from the target it was assigned to - it's moving outside the minimum range of its rockets. For this reason, you should probably consider rockets and shock/explosion to be incompatible.

Rockets provide high single-target damage and higher damage for targets closely grouped together than the chain lightning evolution. The chain lightning evolution is better against spread out bunches of mooks. Volus sentinels might want to think about whether they are able to get enemies grouped around their decoys in tight bunches. If they are, rockets may be a better investment. A nice feature about rockets is that they can be placed on large targets during solos, stopping their shields from regenerating.

Taken together, it seems that there are two ways to build your drone: shields/shields/rockets or explosion/shock/chain. With the first, you have a fairly hardy drone that can deal out largish amounts of damage to single targets, or enemies that are close together for some reason (some enemies like abominations hunt in packs, others may be clustered together because of a decoy). A drone built this way will have 1100 shields. If we look at [enemy damage](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ArNVjEsDluBFdFhvQkRHR2VBNFBRUnNERzlIeHhRUXc&amp;output=html) and combine it with what we know from Cyonan's damage thread here - social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/343/index/15699700/ - , we can see that a rocket drone will survive around 11 bullets from a marauder on gold. The staggar from the rockets ensures a bit more survivability fortunately. And naturally not all the enemies bullets connect. So it's a wee bit more durable than the statistics would imply. Rocket drones also tend to stay closer to you, so likely enemies aiming at them won't be shooting at you or your teammates, which is a great bonus. You may want to consider whether to take a heavier weapon if you're building your drone to be less frequently deployed.

Lately however, I've been speccing my drone for explosion/shock/lightning. The explosion turns the drone's fragility into a benefit, the shock provides an excellent means of crowd control even for mid-level enemies like phantoms and dragoons, and the chain lightning gives the drone something to do while moving from one group of enemies to another.

1359145149.0,28,self.MECoOp,179vze,Class 401: Introduction to Weapons,32,4,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/179vze/class_401_introduction_to_weapons/,"This series of guides will go over the various weapon classes in ME:3. An evaluation of each weapon's strengths, weaknesses will be given in addition to tips on usage.

Before going into the weapons themselves, it is important to discuss certain game mechanics and concepts that have significant impact on weapon selection and modifications. Weapons mods are also elaborated on in this section. Consumables and equipment will only be talked about briefly as there are already college entries for them.

**Hit Scan vs Projectile Weapons**

These are the two different ways weapons are implemented in ME:3 (and most other games). 

For hitscan weapons, rounds do not actually travel through the air and instead make instant contact with their destination (this is not to be confused with the air tracers that are drawn on the screen as these are cosmetic only). In general, hitscan weapons are much more responsive and easier to use in games with high latency.

Projectile weapons actually fire an object that flies through the air and can usually be seen by the player (this is most easily seen on the Geth Plasma Shotgun or the Falcon). These weapons tend to be more difficult to use in high latency matches as the projectiles usually have noticeable travel time. Projectile weapons have a high chance to apply ammo powers compared to their hitscan counterparts.

**Shield Gate**

From the Bioware Gameplay Mechanics thread (social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/347/index/9822648):

&gt; Whenever an enemy shield/barrier is destroyed (last point taken off), the rest of the damage that passes through to the health/armor is cut by X%, where X is:

&gt; * 50% on Bronze

&gt; * 75% on Silver and up

&gt; This means that if an enemy has a single sliver of shields on Insanity/Gold, any weapon bullet will only take the remaining point off, and then a second bullet is required to start damaging the health/armor. This means that even the most powerful sniper rifle will take 2 shots to kill any shielded enemy on Insanity/Gold. For shotguns, keep in mind that most fire multiple pellets, so even if some of the damage gets cut off on one of the pellets, the remaining pellets should pass through to the health/armor. 

Typically, rapid fire weapons and shotguns (with their pellet mechanic explained above) are better suited to dealing with shield gating.

High burst single shot weapons suffer much more from the gate due to how they deal their damage. To combat shield gate, consider using phasic ammunition. It has a 10x multiplier against shields and actually applies this multiplied damage in a separate instance before the shot itself. Other ammo powers such as warp or disruptor also work well. Alternatives include using shield stripping powers (overload, energy drain) or using the Acolyte pistol as a sidearm.

Certain weapons also completely ignore shield gates (mostly projectile weapons).
For more information, see section [501](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16zcwq/me_coop_college_501_making_the_jump_to_gold/) of the college.

**Armour** 

Enemies that have armour (opposed to health) will reduce all incoming packets of damage by a fixed amount. For rapid fire weapons or shotguns armour penetration is extremely important, especially on higher difficulties. For more information, see section [501](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16zcwq/me_coop_college_501_making_the_jump_to_gold/) of the college.

Armour on a target can either be penetrated (the damage reduction is lowered for only the player) or weakened (the damage reduction is lowered for everyone in the squad).

To deal with armour, make use of armour penetration, drill, cryo, or warp ammunition, or armour penetration weapon mods. Certain powers may also weaken armour (such as cryo blast and warp).

Armour penetration stacks additively with itself (65% penetration + 25% penetration = 90% penetration, or 90% of the armour DR ignored per shot). Armour weakening functions similarly. Penetration and weakening stack multiplicatively (50% penetration and 50% weakening means 75% armour DR ignored per shot).

Certain weapons may also innately ignore the damage reduction (usually projectile weapons).

**Cover Penetration**

The cover that enemies attempt to hide behind can be shot through given the right weapon or modification (albeit usually with significantly lowered damage). This includes thin physical barriers, guardian shields, and even walls. Cover penetration is not to be confused with armour penetration as the flat damage reduction from armour is unrelated.

In general, projectile weapons cannot pierce through cover even with modifications.

Certain weapons also possess some innate cover penetration. All sources of cover penetration stack additively. If a weapon does not have innate cover penetration, adding sources of it to a gun (via ammo or mods) will allow it to penetrate, but induce a damage penalty.

**Cooldown, Charge Up, and Rev Up Weapons**

Certain weapons do not use ammo in the same way as other weapons. Similar to how ME1 weapons functioned, they have infinite ammo that regenerates when not firing the weapon, but if the gun runs out of ammo, they need to go through a long cooldown animation that must be fully completed. Magazine size increases are highly valuable on these sort of weapons.

For other weapons, the trigger can be held down to charge up the shot. This typically yields extra damage and for certain weapons also consumes additional ammunition.

Lastly, firing specific weapons for a sustained period increases their RoF, damage, and/or ammo consumption up to cap. 

Getting staggered or entering active cover will reset a charge or revved up state.

**Reload Cancelling**

Reload cancelling is an incredibly important skill players should know and leads to significantly reduced reload times (around 60% faster on the Claymore!).

When reloading a weapon, there is a certain point in the animation where is gun is actually ready to use. A player can cancel the rest of the animation and be ready to fire again much quicker. 

Keep an eye on the clip indicator. As soon as it refills, the animation can be cancelled. To actually perform the cancel there are several options: dodging, sprinting, or casting a power will do the cancel. Some PC players might find it convenient to bind medigel to an accessible key like control and use that to perform the cancel.

For a video demonstration, see [Class 505](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/18vzrr/mecoop_college_tips_and_tricks_505_video/)

**The Right-Hand Advantage**

The Right-Hand Advantage (or RHA) is a very useful tactic that players can use to significantly reduce damage while still being able to shoot.

Since all characters are right-handed and this game is 3rd person, a player can walk up to and then position themselves on a wall in a way that completely obscures their body from enemies in front, but still allows them to shoot.

[See this image for an example](http://imgur.com/0J1xXLu)

Note that the RHA is not the same as active cover. While the player is completely obscured from fire, they are still able to shoot. The stability and accuracy bonuses granted from using active cover are lost, but being able to fire from complete safety is well worth the trade.

To help maximize the effectiveness of the RHA, run counterclockwise laps on a map (as this will give you more walls and cover on your left side, which allows use of the RHA)

For a video demonstration, see [Class 505](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/18vzrr/mecoop_college_tips_and_tricks_505_video/)

**Weapon Modifications**

All weapons allow for two modifications at any given time.

Most of the mods are straightforward in description (for exact formulas, see the weapon damage formula at (social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/347/index/10639449/1#10639449)

It is worth noting a few things:

* Projectile weapons do not benefit much, if at all, from armour/cover penetration mods 

* If a gun has innate cover penetration, it will stack additively with cover penetration on a mod. An un-modded pierce-capable gun deals 100% damage (if it can pierce all the way through) when shooting through cover. If modded, the weapon does not take on the listed mod piercing penalty regardless of the thickness of the cover being pierced.

* Melee mods increase melee damage multiplicatively whereas power mods only work additively. Both kinds only take effect when the weapon they are attached to is the currently active weapon.

*Debatable evolutions:*

**Rank 6 proxy mine vs rank 5 fitness.** I usually run the GI with adrenaline mods, so I really want that shield-recharge. But the rank 6 proxy mine (damage) is also a good choice especially if you are more of a cyclonic modulator person.

The only really notable thing is that it will allow you to kill a (gold) husk with one proxy mine, but in my opinion that isn't that big of a big deal, unless you are using the claymore or the wraith. 

**Rank 6 hunter mode.** I personally am 100% with speed and vision, but there are some people that swear by damage, so I'll mention it. 

Keep in mind that the hunter mode damage is an additive bonus, which means that with high level equipment that the actual damage increase of those 10% will be more along the lines of 2.5%. 

And in my opinion that just isn't worth as much as the extended vision and the movement speed of the other evolution. 

---

**Weapons**
---

This is the dps god, so you want as much dps as you can get. Lol-reegar, harrier, piranha, particle rifle, hurricane and talon are my recommendations. 

For a slightly different play style, wraith and claymore are also amazing. 

**Ammo:** Warp. You want the most dps you can get, and you get the most with warp. I don't like incendiary on this class (even with the reegar) because stuff simply dies too fast for the incendiary to do it’s thing. (And banshees are a pain with incendiary because it doesn't work while they do their hand thing.)

For assault rifles ap-ammo is better/equal to warp, because the AR high-velocity barrel doesn't have a damage bonus. 

**Armor:** If you are comfortable with squishy characters, take adrenaline mods. Playing a geth or a drell with adrenaline mods is insanely fun and you are huge asset to your team for 1234 and pizza objectives. Also enemies have huge trouble ever hitting you while you are on the move. 

Otherwise, cyc mods are amazing as well. Geth have high base shields, and the cyc mods apply bonuses that are basically based on the base. Which means that a cyclonic modulator actually turns the geth into a reasonably sturdy character. 

---

**The Triumvirate of opness:**

Yeah... GI with harrier and reegar. 

This has been my loadout of choice with the GI lately. As overpowered as things get in this game. 

I actually tried this in a not completely serious way, but it worked so well that I did a platinum solo with it. 

I generally prefer the reegar, but also taking a harrier gives you so much more flexibility.

---

**Gameplay:**
--

The basic premise is to stagger everything with proxy mine and then use the insane dps to kill before it can recover. 

**Videos:** 

I have a gold solo and a platinum solo. 

The gold one might look really weird to a lot of people because of the complete recklessness and it might be quite hard to emulate that playstyle without a lot of practice. 

The way I play in the platinum game is probably more along the lines of how you want to play this class if you don't have that much experience with it. Much more careful and less ""in your face"" action. 

[**Gold:**](http://youtu.be/Iw_pANXsPkU) This one was kind of a nostalgia thing for me, because I did my first ever gold solo with exactly the same setup (well Harrier IV instead of X). I took less than half the time I needed back then, it's nice to see that I've improved. 

I also got 10 waves survived, which I'm pretty proud of with a character like the geth. It also shows that a geth with cyclonic 4, his high movement speed and wallhax really shouldn't be considered a squishy character. 

[**Platinum:**](http://youtu.be/dszdBo08R2g) By far the best platinum solo I've done. Sorry for the bad video quality, I had to turn to the settings down a notch because I didn't want to deal with a 3gb file and a 10+ hour upload again.) 

---

**On proximity mine**

I want to take this chance to reiterate what an amazing power this is. 

Take a look at this neat table. [Set up is this.](http://i.imgur.com/qcikIl9.jpg) Everything is against health. 

x|Yes cloak|No cloak
---|---|---|
Yes proxy|3098|2470
No proxy|2581|2065

Bottom line, the 20% debuff is enormously important, in fact almost as important as the cloak bonus. So if you are shooting a target that hasn't been proxy mined, you are missing out on a huge amount of damage. 

Additionally the debuff doesn't only apply to you, but also to all your teammates. So, spam proxy mine whenever you can and at as many enemies as possible. 

---

**Conclusion**

I hope you enjoyed my guide about the (in my humble opinion) best class and build in this game.

Surprisingly enough, the once omni-present GI seems to have somewhat fallen into disuse by a lot of people (maybe I'm just playing with the wrong people though).

It's true that the ghost is much easier to play, but if you play the GI well, he will always be superior. ",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,1373372663.0,,,True,t3_16vo2n,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16vo2n/unnecessarily_long_guide_the_higher_being_geth/,

I've figured out a way for the micless members of our immaculate pure-blooded race to be able to communicate in-game using Text to Speech programs. *No new software is needed.* 

It's kinda janky and requires a few steps to work, but if all goes well you'll never have to sit mutely fuming at some pubbie ignoramus with AP mods on a projectile weapon again. 

* Step 1: Check your Sound menu and see if you can use ""Stereo Mix"" as your Voice Chat Input Device. If that's not an option, we'll need to enable it. [Directions googled up yonder for Vista, XP and 7.](http://en.kioskea.net/faq/6316-windows-enabling-stereo-mix)
 
Once you've got that taken care of, set your ME3 mic input to Stereo Mix, with the Push to Talk option. Doesn't really matter what key you pick -- as with any shooter, text chat is cumbersome to use unless you're out of battle.

* Step 2: Scare up some kinda Text-to-Speech functionality. This should be preinstalled on most windows machines -- [google it thusly](https://www.google.com/search?q=windows+xp+text+to+speech+control+panel&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a#hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;tbo=d&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=windows+7+text+to+speech&amp;oq=windows+7+text+to+speech&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0l4.937051.939284.0.939751.3.3.0.0.0.0.400.818.0j1j1j0j1.3.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.1.8dFn0GA9V-I&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.1355534169,d.cGE&amp;fp=31229be95c8561f6&amp;bpcl=40096503&amp;biw=1143&amp;bih=702) for Windows 7, or find it [here](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306902) on XP and Vista, and follow the directions for ""Preview TTS Voice."" 

You'll be using this preview line as your chatbox. You may want to buffer your text a little bit with some ""zzzz"" or whatever, to give you time to alt-tab back to your game and hit the push to talk key. Which brings us to...

* Step 3: De-Jankify That Bullhonky. There are two things to do in order to streamline this crap. Firstly, you'll want to change from running the game in fullscreen to Windowed (No Border.) I don't know if this will cause any framerate hit, but I didn't notice any difference on my moderately economical non-potato PC. Alt-tabbing will be much faster, and you can even skip waiting through the ""Press any key"" and long wait at startup along with any other waiting screen.

The other big usability thing I've found is pinning the Text to Speech program to the Start Menu. When you need it, you don't want to be fumbling for it, and it can be a little too easy to close the program accidentally.

This guide is going to focus on sustained damage using tac scan and marksman to open up the enemy to a world of hurt.


[**BUILD**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/QuarianMarksman/QNANR/CerberusHarrier10AF5AD5//AssaultRifleRailAmp3/StabilizationModule4/BarrageUpgrade5/)


**Marksman**: The core of this build. For 4, take accuracy if you need it, or ROF if you don't. Either way, you're going to want to go Headshots and Acc/ROF for the other two. Basically, this build is around turning our masked friend into the headshotter from hell, so the fourth evo should go accuracy if you're using an inaccurate AR to make that headshotting more consistent, or ROF if your AR is good enough to consistently get headshots.

**Tac Scan**: This is the other half of your power combo. The way to use it is simple: just tac scan and start firing: the cooldown should wear off at some point while you're still firing (it's short, so don't really worry about weight), then just hit marksman, which refills your clip, and go to town. Take Weapon damage (obviously), ~~Headshots (see where I'm going with the headshots?)~~ and your preference for 6. I like Area scan just for the utility and extra awareness, but it's up to you.

*Apparently, the headshot upgrade doesn't actually work on this power (Thanks ImNotASWFanboy), so I guess take the slow-- it'll help with headshots! SO MANY HEADSHOTS!

**Sabotage**: Skip it. The only way to not make the CD terrible with a decent AR is to take more points than I'm willing out of something else. I can see going for a support build for a tech team with tech vulnerability on this plus power damage on tac scan, but that's not what we're doing here.

**Offensive Passives**: Straight weapon damage and headshots. You don't have any damage dealing powers, and weight is very forgiving on this class. Also, MORE HEADSHOTS.

**Fitness**: At least until Bioware makes his defense not terrible, try not to make this guy's momma cry and try to melee anyone, okay? Straight defense-- it may not do much now, but wait for the fix next week, and this guy'll actually be able to take some hits.


**WEAPONS**

Basically any accurate assault rifle that you can reliably get headshots with. I use the Harrier (because of course), but you can do GPR, PPR, or even the Collector Rifle. Just aim for the squishy bits, and you're golden. If you're using something with a lot of recoil, you may want to throw on a stability upgrade. Otherwise, you definitely want some piercing on this guy, since he is a hell of a boss killer. Scopes help you headshot, and damage is always nice if nothing else fits. I go stability and piercing.

**GEAR**


It really depends on what you're using for a weapon. Since I go Harrier, I also go Barrage for the stability and slight increase to the terrible, terrible clip. You could go Vulnerability if you're confident with headshotting, or straight up AR amp if you're not. For consumables, anything to boost damage is nice. Again, Stability if you need it (**remember, you're not a Turian!**), headshots and AR if you don't. AP ammo or Drill ammo is nice because it eliminates the need for an AP mod, freeing up a slot.

**STRATEGY**


~~Pretty simple: just point and shoot. Like I said before, tac scan, start firing, then marksman when your clip is almost empty to really go medieval on their asses (or heads). Headshot as much as possible, and they will drop like flies. This guy tears up Collectors better than most classes because of their gigantic freakin' heads, which practically beg for you to hit them. And remember, Tac Scan boosts other people's damage too, so teaming up with other weapons classes (snipers especially) works wonders.~~

Okay, forget all of that. This guy is actually quite a bit harder than I thought, mostly due to his multiple breakages. His health/shields are shit, and tac scan doesn't allow him to be the headshot monster I thought he'd be. Long story short, he's weird. You have to play him almost like an infiltrator rather than a soldier. Your low defenses coupled with the complete lack of AOE/panic button means that you have to stay constantly on the move to find the safest spot you can shoot people from without letting anyone sneak up behind you. 

I've also found that my Quarksman is a surprisingly good pair with a Demolisher, of all people. Basically, he provides the panic button AOE (I named my Demolisher Ralph 'Nader, and I'm really sad that no one can see that), along with ammo aplenty, and you just go goddamn nuts at mid- to long-range. Try it out-- I had fun. It's best if they have some kind of shotgun or something to deal with close range threats, as you can take care of anything else.

**Build** [**N**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/Quarian/FNPPF/Claymore10BH5AP5//ShotgunRailAmp3//GrenadeCapacity5/) - [**K**](http://kalence.drupalgardens.com/me3-builder#54!3806555!!34O533!5AE95)


**Tactical cloak:**

This build doesn't involve a sniper rifle, so more than 4 points doesn't make much sense. Duration and Damage is just personal preference, just take what you like.

**Sticky Grenades:**

It sometimes seems as if these things have disappeared into the abyss, never to be seen again. 

Which is very surprising, because sticky grenade is the power that does the most damage in the entire game. The only thing that comes close is homing grenade and smash, but well, those classes don't have cloak.

Take damage on the first choice, because that's what stickies are good for. And seriously, 60cm more radius won't make much difference.

I recommend taking grenade gear with this class, so  you really don't need even more grenades, and the armor-piercing is pretty badass (it's a real 1.5 multiplicator). 

Lastly, take proximity trap. Even more damage would be nice of course, but the trap evo doesn't only increase the radius, but also provides a lot of utility.  

It’s much more forgiving if you miss a grenade, because hey, in 15 seconds, chances are something's gonna walk into it anyway. Also it's great against phantoms, because they don't raise their bubble if they walk into one. 

**Sabotage:**

Sabotage might not be the godly power of doom and destruction it once was, but hey, it's still pretty awesome. It stuns the target twice, sets up tech-bursts and makes synthetic enemies do retarded shit. 

First take backfire damage, because duration is useless. Also, sabotage actually does kind of respectable damage with it (enough to kill a gold husk).

Now next, we have one of those choices, where both options are bad, but one is even worse than the other. Recharge speed is completely useless because of cloak and explosive hack only really does anything against geth. Against geth, the extra damage and staggers are nice to have though. 

Finally, tech vulnerability. This is awesome.   
While it doesn't affect sticky grenades (those are a combat power), there are plenty of other things it does affect. 

First of all, it increases sabotage's backfire damage (which puts the damage around 1500 against shields and 1000 against the rest).

All tech explosions are also affected by tech vulnerability. As far as I know this is the only power that increases tech combo damage that actually works, which makes your fire explosions all the more awesome. 

Tech vulnerability is of course even more awesome if there are any heavy tech characters on your team. Vorchas, geth trooper, paladin, quarian engineer, human engineer... Tech vulnerability will make these classes godlike. 

**Quarian Defender:**

The first two choices here can really go either way and it really doesn't make much of a difference. If you have damage cloak, you might be a little more inclined to take the extra capacity, with a claymore the cooldown can get pretty long if you have to sit in cloak for some reason. 

The second one really depends on what weapon you are using and how good you are at getting headshots. 

Finally, weapon damage, of course.

**Fitness:**

Durability.

---

**Weapons:**

First of all, if you want to use a sniper rifle, you need a different build. I'm sure there's a sniper QFI build in the BBloB somewhere. 

Sticky grenades tend to be easier to use from close to your target, so in my opinion, shotguns have a better synergy with the QFI. 

For maximum boom-boom effect, the clymore is the way to go.

As far as I know reload-cancelling on console is a bit of bitch though, so that might nor really work there, as the claymore is rather mediocre without it. 

The wraith is the next option, it's basically just as good as the claymore, but not as reload-cancel dependent, so that might be the way to go for console users. 

Other than that the typical high dps weapons (reegar, harrier, prianha, talon, saber) will of course work as well, but if you want to make the most out of the weird sticky grenade + ammo effect behaviour (explained below), you want to maximize damage per single shot.  

---

**Da Videos:**

Gameplay is much easier to show than to descripe, so here it is:

[Female Quarian Infiltrator gold solo](http://youtu.be/IiZSQGkjIh8)

For some reason my gameplay really went down the drain somewhere around wave 7 in this game, but I'm pretty happy with the first half. 

There are time-links for the waves and my death/ops-packs in the description as well as some comments. 

Because this is an infiltrator I originally wanted to platinum for the video, so I could show how I play against all the factions. But the combination of the claymore (no mistake tolerance + not that great sustained dps) and a grenade class (no armored compartments) proved too much for me. 

Still, I've uploaded a recording of one of my platinum tries [here](http://youtu.be/66sNFrKHFFs) in case anyone is interested in seeing me fail pretty badly on wave 7 (and die twice to a single geth prime on wave 4). The biggest problem in this game was the retarded loadout (I don't even know what I was thinking when I picked warp ammo).   
If nothing else, this shows that this class is perfectly platinum viable, even with a stupid loadout and mediocre gameplay (just like every other class in the game...). 

The exact build I used for the videos is [this](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/Quarian/ENFLR/Claymore10BH5AP5//ShotgunRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator4/GrenadeCapacity5/).

**About sticky grenade weirdness:**

I added this section after the large amount of confusion about sticky grenades and ammo damage and tech vulnerability in MasterVash's thread. I hope I can clear everything up.

First of all, sticky grenades are a combat power and do not get the damage bonus from tech vulnerability. 

There is a reason though why the stickies seem to do more damage than they should. 

There is a bug (or a really weird mechanic) that makes sticky grenade apply ammo effects to a target (when they are stuck to it). They do additional damage based on the ammo and weapon you are using. They also apply any other ammo effects (armor weakening, chilling/freezing) and can set up any combos the ammo type normally sets up.

Now as for the reason why incendiary ammo is so ridiculously awesome on this class:

Because ammo effects are applied before the grenade explosion, sticky grenades can create tech explosions by themselves. You can see this several times in my video ([4:55](http://youtu.be/IiZSQGkjIh8?t=4m55s))

So the already insane damage of the sticky grenades gets boosted even further. With a claymore X, the build above and incendiary IV a single sticky grenade would do a total damage of:

    (1648*0.5)=824   incendiary ammo damage over 3 seconds
    (1100*(1+0.2+0.3+0.1+0.1+0.15+0.4)*1.5)=3712.5    sticky grenade damage (with cloak, against armor)
    100*(1+((1+6)-2)*0.15)*3.375*2*1.5=1771.875  fire explosion damage (against armor, with sabotage rank 6) 

    824+3712.5+1771.875=6308.375  total damage

With damage cloak and full damage on stickies it could go up to:
   
    (1100*(1+0.2+0.3+0.1+0.1+0.15+0.4+0.8)*1.5)=5032.5  sticky grenade damage (with cloak, against armor) 

     824+5032.5+1771.875=7628.375   total damage (just short of killing a ravager, but would die of sabotage)

Keep in mind though that for a fire explosion, you actually have to stick the grenade to the target. And like with weapons, the incendiary effect is not guaranteed with every shot/grenade. 

This only really works with incendiary ammo. Cryo ammo can only be detonated when the target is completely frozen (which is only possible on health) and I'm not completely sure if it would work with disruptor ammo on armored targets, but even if it did, the damage would be insignificant. 

Here is an example of why this is so good. Assuming you 1. cloak; 2. sticky grenade; 3. sabotage; 4. claymore:

    4536.5    sticky grenade damage (including incendiary dot over 3 seconds)
    1771.9    fire explosion damage (this may or may not mess with the incendiary dot)
    4268.4    claymore damage (including incendiary dot over 3 seconds, the stacking bug would increase this)
    1057.5    sabotage backfire damage against armor
    
    4536.5+1771.9+4268.4+1057.5=11624.4    total damage against armor

Basically, this is an incredible combo and huge burst of damage in a very short time. 

*(edit: Made a mistake. Should be about 700 less. Too lazy to redo.)*

I'm pretty happy about getting this into one post this time. I even have a couple characters to spare! 

I hope I've gotten some people to dust of the QFI. She's a very solid character with decent dps and the ability to put out an incredible burts of damage if necessary.  
She is also great to have on any tech team, as she will make everything (including tech combos) infinitely (well ... 50%) stronger.

Also, plenty of guns have bird names as well and I wouldn't be surprised if a gun in the future is called the Vulture.*

**Preface**

There was a Harrier circle-jerk thread last week where people claimed that the ""The Harrier is the best assault rifle by miles"" (better yes, but not by miles. Too much exaggeration). So I begrudgingly decided to toy with it, because I loathe hovering over an ammo box to use the gun consistently. Considering I haven't specced out a Turian Havoc, I decided to try and mix the two. The results were better than expected

**Introduction**

The critical weakness of the Harrier is its lack of spare ammo. Fortunately there's this pretty cool gear called Thermal Clip Storage, which increases spare ammo count by up to 30%. While this doesn't completely solve the Harrier's unquenchable thirst for thermal clips, it kills it enough so that I don't have to pitch a tent outside an ammo box.

Also, the Turian Havoc's signature ability is Havoc Strike. At its core, it's a Combat version of Biotic Charge. Naturally, I don't want any part of that. By the grace of BioWare, the Havoc has the benefit of possessing Cryo Blast. Cryo Blast is a debuffing power affecting speed and armor reduction, and is capable of doing so in a radius and can increase the damage an enemy takes. 

Considering the Harrier gets hit pretty hard by armor damage reduction, combining the Harrier with Cryo Blast makes sense. Stim Packs allow the Havoc to eat damage while debuffing and killing, making for a lean and mean [killing machine](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/TurianHavoc/RAPNR/CerberusHarrier8AD5AC5////ThermalClipStorage5/).

**Cryo Blast**

This power gets you farther than you think. Slowing down enemies and weakening armor by default, the evolutions of Cryo Blast dramatically improve its power in debuffing enemies.

Because the Harrier has has such little spare ammo, getting the most out of each shot is important. This is why I chose to go with both damage debuffs, as this allows for a 25% damage debuff in addition to a 50% armor damage reduction debuff when using Cryo Blast. This makes every rapid fire weapon that much more useful and is a good skill to help teammates as well (like Warp). And because the Havoc has no other power to deal with crowd control, the area evolution was taken to deal with that. 

Before shooting a burst form the Harrier, debuff them with Cryo Blast. It makes getting those crucial headshots that much easier. Even your teammates will thank you, despite the fact that Cryo Explosions can only occur on completely frozen targets (Health only).

**Stim Packs**

Maxing out shielding is useful, considering the massive bonus it gives (4000 shields!). Compared to weapon damage, shielding blows it away by a long shot.

I prefer pack numbers instead of duration because at such a low number of Stim Packs, they both offer the same net duration (3 packs * 6 seconds vs 2 packs * 9 seconds) and the number of packs lets you get your shield boost more often. If you use a Grenade Capacity gear of some sort, pack duration tends to be the better deal.

Use these as preemptive Survival Ops Packs, when you know danger is just around the corner. The extra little bit of damage along with massive shielding will allow the Havoc to shoot efficiently, especially when under heavy fire.

**Passives**

Considering that Cryo Blast deals no damage and has a quick recharge, there is almost no reason to put points into power damage and weight capacity evolutions. Instead, I put points into weapon damage and stability bonuses. I can't complain about a stronger and more stable weapon.

*Fun Fact*- Combining the stability bonuses with a stability mod on the Harrier completely eliminates the recoil on the Harrier.

Considering that I rarely melee as well, I dropped points into shielding in Fitness. It lets me get away from those minor scratches done by mooks w/o forcing a Stim Pack.

**Weapons and Gear**

Easily the most important part here, this build was designed around the Harrier. It fires fast, has good accuracy, and hits pretty hard for its rate of fire. Naturally, we want to find other weapons that can fit these criteria as well. Those weapons include the likes of the Collector Assault Rifle, Phaeston, Vindicator, Piranha, and Scimitar. 

Now once you have your weapon of choice, now it's time to decide what gear to equip. If you think ammo starvation is going to be an issue, I recommend any mod that increases spare ammo like the Thermal Clip Storage and Barrage Package mods. If ammo starvation is not going to be an issue, I would recommend just weapon damage gear like the Shotgun Amp and Warfighter Package.

I like the Harrier here because I have to go back to ammo boxes every now and then (don't have to camp with Thermal Clip Storage V) for Stim Packs anyways, plus the elimination of recoil on a gun is quite the experience for me. This is added on top of the Harriers nice ability to easily eliminate enemies with its high damage per second against enemies. These attributes can carry over to the other weapons mentioned above as well, but I think the Harrier excels at these qualities the best.

**Conclusion**

So if you want to try out a rapid fire weapon, like the Harrier, I recommend trying this build out. A simple debuff and shoot build, yet quite effective and is even capable of being a strong team player by debuffing and tanking enemies.

So, do you think that this class is fine without Havoc Strike? Or is not using a kit's signature power a crime against humanity? Have you used something similar to this and loved/hated it? Write down in the comments section below. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter.

U/U/ Gold tested and approved. ,30,2,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11t07w/blood_pack_hit_squad_a_fantastic_team_build_uu/,"To start, I love the Volus Engineer. He has quickly become my favorite class to play, despite the dismal scores the player who wields it puts up. Also, I rarely play platinum so I do not know if this strategy would work well on it. Use at your own risk.  

A group of guys I play with have been messing around with team make ups and stumbled upon a gem of a team makeup - assuming you have a group of guys to play with. 


The Players:
-----------------------------------------
1 Vorcha Soldier Spec'd for health, flamer, whatever is convenient

2 Krogan Sentinels, Vanguards, or Soldiers Specc'd for Health and Damage Reduction

1 Volus Engineer. - Spec'd for shield spamming as fast as possible. Carry an Acolyte X to help take down boss's shields, and spec it for cryo or incendiary rounds to help with fire explosions. 

The Game Play:
----------------------------------------------------

We picked a party lead (in our case the vorcha) and everyone made sure to stay with the vorcha. The vorcha controlled where the group went, making sure not to run faster than our lumbering Krogan friends could go. To be clear: The volus must focus only on shield boosting during cluster fuck situations. Often times I didn't even fire my weapon - I just made sure I was close enough to the damage dealers. A well ran Volus makes these 3 tanking classes invincible. 

Because we were all staying with Senior Vorcha, everyone stayed within range of the Volus' Shield boost. 

The result:
---------------------------------------------

An orgy of fire explosions and melee death. The Krogan's tasks were to annihilate bosses with weapon fire and grenades, the vorcha got mooks. We were on Reapers, so whenever a sync capable boss came, we backed onto a ramp and let Krogans go to town melee style while the vorcha used flamer. 

We pushed through Gold Reapers using almost no consumables in about 26 minutes. Almost no one went down and it was a hell of a lot more fun then sitting behind a desk. 

No matter the mission (Pizza Delivery, Escort, Sensors) as long as the group stayed together and the vorcha didn't sprint - we were unstoppable. 


Give it a shot - it was a metric shit ton of fun. 


Quick Aside: For another fun novelty round, Three Destroyers + Particle Rifles + Volus Engineer and an Acolyte results in unlimited mayhem and melty bad guy goodness. The Particle Rifles prevents the need to get Ammo by everyone but the volus. The volus strips shields and the PRs

Basically, we stayed clustered together and the Stagger Proof Destroyers rained death down upon everything. A well placed recon mind providing a 25% damage debuff added to the speed at which legions fell before us.

It does feel like they have a little more health on average than equal units of other factions, but they're pretty manageable if you don't freak. In order of weakest to hardest I think it's like this:

1. Cerberus: Still pretty predictable. Aside from Phantoms they don't really have a unit that makes you stop with the Rambo. The new Dragoons stagger pretty easily and while that Hornet hurts from range they go down easy enough IMO. My reaction time is a lil better than Kip's, but not much, and I can dodge the Smash. The Atlas remains the easiest boss unit, even with the new missile DoT. His weak spots are huge and easy to hit.

2. Reapers: I think familiarity really helps with Reapers. They're the only faction that hasn't changed much as of late. The Banshee is the only scary unit and she's manageable when the barrier is down. Her buggy sync kill, variable speed, and relatively small size for a boss make her tougher than the Atlas. Marauders were the worst mid-tier unit before the Collectors dropped, but awareness and a team that can prioritize targets properly reduces their impact. The lack of a cloaked or very undersized unit makes playing against these guys pretty straight forward. 

3. Collectors: They're new so tactics are still developing but these guys can be beat if the team stays cool and keeps on the move. Praetorians are scary looking but focus fire on the skull box on their chest, the belly(mines and grenades seem to work) or allegedly their butts, and they can be brought down. Scions hit like trucks, but they are slow and their bubbles aren't impossible to hit. They seem to be priority targets even in pugs. Swarms suck for power users, but that's why you have a gun. Keep up the pew pew until your powers are back online. The Captains and basic units have HUGE heads. I've gotten more headshots against Collectors than any other faction. Possesion and aggression lift these guys above Reapers by a fair bit. Ihate them most on Hazard because they're pretty quiet overall.

4. Geth: Every unit aside from the basic Trooper is broken in some form. Hunter range is insane and stagger is just a mirage. Pyros have range beyond the flame graphic and dodge too often for a shield/armor unit. At least it's very slow. Bombers don't have a stagger that I've seen and are WAY too mobile for an armored/shielded unit. Giving them a stun feels like a middle finger. Rocket Troopers should make youtube videos on reload cancelling and they bend missiles better than I bend biotic powers. Primes would be the second easiest boss if they didn't spam tiny turrets with the DPS of a marauder, and drone that can even stagger a Kroguard seemingly continuously. I know I'm not breaking new ground calling these guys the worst of the factions, but the difference in difficulty when playing the Geth on any level above Bronze is pretty noticeable IMO.

TL;DR: Cerberus easiest, Reapers, Collectors, Geth hardest.

Select a Human, and Play on Firebase London, rio, or Vancouver, you get a 10% dmg bonus.

A nice goal, but there is an interesting tip to taking them down faster.

Some people may not know that once the Atlas's shields are down, any player can shoot the 5 armor plates on the Atlas. These plates are located on both knees, both shoulders, and in the crotch of the mech. You will notice the plates kinda stick out when looking at the mech from the side.

When the plates are shot at by a hit-scan weapon (non-projectile), the plates lose health along with the Atlas mech losing armor.

I played in a few pub games afterwords with different people, and I found that every single time I was in a game with a Demolisher they either voted to kick me or refused to start the game until I changed class.

I totally understand where they're coming from, so I've been just not using grenades when I'm in a resupply area. I get the additional ammo, and the Demolisher gets to keep their grenades.

My favorite build at the moment would be the [Geth Infiltrator](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#43PIRNA@0@0) with a Javelin. 

Tact - Damage - Recharge -Sniper (The second is really personal preference, but I dont find myself meleeing much on gold)

Hunter Mode - Bottom 3

Network AI - Weapon Damage Headshots and Weapon Damage
 
After this it's personal preference - I upped Prox Min to damage taken so you can do even more damage, but important parts are Hunter, Tactical Cloak and Network AI spec'd up to the most damage with sniper rifle headshots. The Geth Bonus applies to the Javelin. 

With this build without equipment you can easily take off half a prime's health with one headshot while cloaked. Throw in the Sniper Rail and Armor Piercing equipment and you can one shot almost anything on Gold. 


Here are some other builds I found very useful on gold

[Salarian Infiltrator](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/s0pza/the_salarian_shotgunner/)

[Drell Adept](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/rl0hy/my_drell_adept_build_and_some_advice/) I prefer the Justicar but if you are getting bored with Asari 

[Krogan Murdertrain](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/s73o9/all_aboard_the_murdertrain_or_how_to_krogan/) This may be the same as this - 
[Krogan Vanguard Tank](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=HK-NFcgzkps#t=310s)

[Geth Engineer ](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/sba9c/this_platform_will_now_efficiently_eliminate_all/c4cmxj7)

[Human Vanguard](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/s09sa/how_to_human_vanguard/)
 This does work, but you absolutely have to play as host, and it helps to play with all biotics so you can set it off.

[Batarian](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/sk2o3/batarian_brute_2_bladed_boogaloo/) Mizzon has a couple Batarian Builds that I can't vouch for as I don't really like the Batarians.

A big wish of mine is to see a large number of SP missions retooled for 4-player coop. While objectives horde-mode is undoubtedly fun, I was a little let down when I heard We wouldn't be doing anything close to a traditional Mass Effect mission with our friends.

It's very feasible from a developer perspective. Art assets are already there, mission mechanics are in place, maps are done. Just tweak/add objectives along the mission path that are geared for multiplayer and tweak enemies and their spawn points for 4 players. For example, hack objectives make a lot of sense when you are trying to get through a locked door and enemies barrel down on you. It would give ME3 a whole ""fight through the instance to kill the final boss."" feel. Spectre packs could be awarded for completing certain conditions such as doing a speed run etc. I wouldn't buy DLC that merely adds new classes/races, but this would certainly be worth my money.

Lore-wise, such missions could be easily construed as cleanup operations before/after Shepard has romped through a place.

I've been playing an Engineer exclusively before yesterday, and took some advice to try other classes. I'm currently working on Adept, which I find enjoyable. So far, I haven't been able to match the proficiency or efficiency I've learned with the Engineer. My kills are down, my points are down, and I have to work like hell to get what I get.

I'm a very quick thinker, even if my fingers are getting less accurate at hitting the right key for what I need. Anyway, my point is: do any of your masters have tips, suggestions or ideas about how to move around a map with an Adapt? As an Engineer, I would stay behind and support the team, run the nodes, and revive when possible. As an Adept, I need to get closer to the front line.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I'm good with bending biotic shots around corners because the Engineer has similar abilities with Incinerate.

Yeah, this unit is good.  Once you have played a few games you'll feel the same way.
I had initially offered my opinion on this character as an alternative to California's worst Ahhnold impersonator's [Capacitor build.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/10lbwp/the_capacitor_geth_engineer/)
Since then there have been several metagame changes to pets, Tech Combos, new powerful gear and equipment added that necessitate an update.
As it is an older kit that, like the Turian Havoc, was indirectly nerfed some people may simply overlook it as the ""worst"" Geth kit.
And, it doesn't have the durability of either the Soldiers or the massive damage potential of the Infiltrator or first Soldier.
But, Hunter Mode is a fantastic power that offers benefits no gear or equipment can.  Overload, well it's great at crowd control, 
detonating Tech Combos and stripping shields.  Those alone are a tremendous framework when paired to a strong weapon will let you rule the battlefield with style.

[narida](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Engineer/Geth/DQLNJ/Saber10AE5AD5/////)

-----
**Powers**

**Geth Turret** - With the changes to AI behaviour with respect to pets Turrets, Decoy and Drones are less powerful than they have been.  
But, they still do draw enemy aggression from trooper, just not from bosses.  The first three ranks is enough to get these benefits and 
restore you shields on occasion.  While holding ground and shooting I like to park it near to me.  It's also good to cast to cancel DoT effects 
and during escorts or package retrieval.

**Hunter Mode** - Increased accuracy, fire rate, damage, run speed and wallhax.  All this for 375 shields.  An easy choice from my point of view.  
Accuracy and fire rate can't be improved through any equipment or gear so I always choose them.  In addition I find the Saber benefits greatly from both of these.
I prefer Speed and Vision for the final evolution for the increase to awareness and survivability it offers.

**Overload** - Unlike my [Turian Sentinel](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/184uma/turian_sentinel/) build I don't feel maxing single target damage is required for this character.  
The Geth Engineer has good mobility, speed, wallhax and 8-14 bullets to deal with enemies.  For this character I prefer choosing Chain Overload at the first branch for the extra crowd control and 
opportunity to detonate self or team-mates Tech Combos.  Because of the way Neural Shock and Shield Damage work they are too good to pass up.  This set up still allows 2516 damage to organic shields and barriers - 
1887 to robots.

**Network AI** - Our main source of damage is our weapon all choices are geared to increase base and headshot damage.

**Advance Hardware** - Since Hunter Mode takes 375 shields payment I gear all options to increasing shields / fitness.

-----
**Weapons**

**M-99 Saber** - This gun is awesome on any class with a boost to accuracy and fire rate.  Depending on the ammo consumable there are two ways to run it.  The one constant is the Extended Barrel.  
It's because of headshots.  With Overload to stun and strip shields and the Hunter Mode bonuses landing headshots becomes much more frequent.  The extended barrel means consistently more damage and 14% more headshot damage for the linked build.
The second slot can be filled with the vanilla piercing mod if using Disruptor, Incendiary or Cyro (? - maybe it's all you have) ammo.  Otherwise choose the extended magazine mod when using either Drill or AP.

Other weapon options that work well are the Indra, Javelin, Black Widow, Harrier, Wraith, M-98 Widow (Legion style points added), Geth Plasma Shotgun, Viper and Mantis.

1376422837.0,29,self.MECoOp,1karia,/R/MeCoOp: The Drinking Game- PvP || Results,31,2,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1karia/rmecoop_the_drinking_game_pvp_results/,"So last night, myself, IMWarden, ladamesansmerci (here-on referred to as lada), and smakl all attempt the drinking game I wrote. Before I start, I would like to give a shoutout to InterwebNinja as I basically blatantly took half of his ideas raw. I do have some comments, but here are the rules we abode by first.

______________________________________________

**How to start PvP**: You must be in a lobby full of redditors (4 redditors) who are verbally communicating. Drinks must be readily on hand.

**What you must have on hand**: Your favorite drink ready to go. This is a competitive game. Additional cups are advised.

**Goal of the game**: Winner takes all. First place gets one point, everyone else gets zero. Player with the most points wins. If there is a tie at the end of the session, the tied player with the most recent victory wins.

**Rules**

To keep things simple, most of these rules only apply during objective waves (Wave 3, 6, and 10) and in the lobby of a game. 

*Lobby*

Before the first game starts, everyone takes 1 drink. No one escapes unharmed. In the first game, everyone may choose a kit/weapon combination of their own choosing. The map/enemy must go to Unknown/Unknown, with the difficulty level staying constant (I personally recommend Gold). After the first game, placement will allow specific actions to occur and they will be described in the *Score Screen* section.

*General gameplay (Any wave)*

* If a player gets sync killed, said player must take 1 drink. 

* If a player gets a revive medal, everyone else takes 1 drink

* If a killstreak medal is rewarded, the player who created the killstreak can give out 1 drink to anyone. If multiple people were involved with the killstreak (say a Biotic Explosion primed by Player 1 and detonated by Player 2), each player who participated can give 1 drink to anyone. Note that a killstreak requires five enemies to be killed in one second. If it is (legitimately) disputed who was involved, no one takes a drink. If the dispute is illegitimate, then you are a filthy liar and RepublicanShredder hates your guts.

* If a waves survived medal is rewarded, then everyone takes 1 drink. 

* If, for any reason, a player does not get extracted then said player must finish their drink. If a mission is a failure, then no one made it to the extraction zone and everyone must finish their drink.

*Objective Waves*

* During *Devices* (1-2-3-4 Objective), the first player to start hacking can give out 1 drink to anyone.

* During *Hack* or *Escort*, the last player inside the hack circle must take 1 drink. Any player who leaves the circle for more than three seconds must take 1 drink. Counting must be audible to the entire party, starting with 'One-One Thousand'.

* During *Assassination* (targets), the player who kills the target can distribute 2 drinks. If the answer is uncertain, everyone takes a drink. If the player kills the target with a missile, the player must take 3 drinks.

* Also during *Retrieval*, the player who is carrying the device becomes the Drink Sergeant. The Drink Sergeant may distribute 1 drink every 10 seconds. However, if the Drink Sergeant loiters around the landing zone the Drink Sergeant must take 1 drink for every 10 seconds loitering. Loitering must be confirmed by 2 players in order for it to take effect.

*Score Screen*


Players go from highest to lowest score instituting these next effects.

1. The top scorer can institute a new drinking rule of his/her choosing. This rule can be rejected by a unanimous veto. This drinking rule will last one game and cannot be a finisher.

2. The second top scorer will choose the kit the top scorer must use in the next game.

3. The third scorer will choose the map the next game will be played on. 'Unknown' is a valid option here.

4. The player in last place will choose the enemy that will be played in the next game. 'Unknown' is a valid option here.


Finally, for every 50k points the top player outscores someone the top scorer must take a drink. For example, if the scores were 240k, 210k, 130k, and 60k, the top player must take (0 for second place + 2 for third place +3 for fourth place) 5 drinks. If further clarification is needed, then send me a score screen and I will explain in further detail.

If a player gets first more than once in a row, second place may force additional restrictions. First restriction is equipment, second time it includes mods, and finally it includes weapons.

___________________________________________________

So, a few comments:

* I have not tested PvE. Maybe in the future I will try and there may be some tougher changes there. I feel in PvE I would either die after the second match because of puns or become a cheap Ahnold quoter. Or both, that works too.

* I was the sober one of the party, so I acted as the official rule enforcer. To compensate, I had to drink water and could not use the bathroom until I got first place (and it felt great when it finally happened) and I owe everyone there about 1 and 2/3^rds bottles of alcohol on some future date.

* I tweaked a few rules right before playing as I realized some were selfish/complicated. There was a rule where doing my favorite chant would result in drink immunity, but that's just my burning desire to not call the object a pizza. There was also another rule involving medal counts and drinks, but that got overcomplicated and made little sense. There might be a few tweaks here and there in the future.

* Some people (Warden) are so good at this game that drinking enough alcohol to down a Krogan does not stop him from staying in first place. I think additional punishment (non-alcohol related ideally- I think Warden drank the most out of all of us) should be in place to prevent the overly-skilled from winning. The only way we stopped his winning streak was making him play a Volus Sentinel, with a Shuriken modded for ULM and Power Amplifier, with Explosive Rounds, Strength Enhancer, Power Amplifier, and Medigel Transmitter against on-host Cerberus. And none of us outscored him by 50k to take a drink.

* Missing extraction can be brutal on some player's livers. I think something like 5 drinks were finished last night because of it. RIP everyone except me in the lobby (sorry smakl, the omnikey prevented me from reviving you during the Liquid Thunder run). I will have my time eventually.

* Because Warden was the best at hosting (lada's connection isn't great, lada couldn't join smakl, my potato/alt-tab fetish cannot handle hosting very well), we only got Escorts and Retrieval as objectives. It's good, as those are the two toughest objectives to drink for but we did not get the fun that could have been Assassination. The Drink Sergeant for Retrieval was interesting, as I think that was the only time I saw redditors *not* sprint with the device. Props to InterwebNinja for suggesting it.

* Some of the winner rules were quite interesting. Warden instituted using only Liquid Thunder (a great time was had by all, especially by the two who play Human Vanguards a lot ^^^^^^^^YOUR ^^^^^^^^TEARS ^^^^^^^^NOURISH ^^^^^^^^ME! ), every weapon had to have ULM, drink everytime lada gets a Batarian Gauntlet punch interrupted, and I forced everyone to use Uncommon/Common weapons. Loads of fun were had by these rules. I bet other people could come with someone equally clever.

* In general, most of the rules were followed without complaint. Halfway through the killstreak medal devolved into everyone else drinking, which is fine as it is a bit of a complicated rule. Also, it's perfectly fine to hold your drink until the end of the wave as long as you remember how many you had to take. Thankfully, everyone was honest in this regard.

* Surprisingly, fairly few revive medals were around. Also, I think everyone got 50 Assists every game, probably because after the first game Warden had to take 9 drinks because he's a scorewhore.

* A great bonding opportunity was had by all at the end of the session (which Warden won by a long shot). I feel celibate when /r/LadyBoners is discussed in detail, but the two discussing it were having a blast.

* This was a fun opportunity and I highly encourage everyone who can to try it. None of us failed, because Warden was there to carry us. Playing on Platinum though, that might be a bit more chaotic.

---

**Debatable evolutions:**

* Rank 6 charge:

This is basically a choice of survivability against damage output. If you can stay alive, take bonus power. If you have trouble, take barrier. 

* Rank 6 passives/fitness vs 3 ranks in stasis:

I used to play her with three points in stasis, but at some point I just realized that I never used it. However if you are not that comfortable with charging into any group of enemies, stasis can be a great help and you don't really miss out on much by skipping rank 6 fitness or passives. 

---

Equipment
---

* **Weapons** 

For this build, I'm going with the trusty acolyte + hurricane combo. The acolyte is kind of a focus of this build, but the hurricane isn't mandatory. 

Alternatives are the piranha, the lancer and the wraith, though the wraith and the lancer are a little heavy if you don't have them at a high level.

If you really want you can also substitute the acolyte with a talon, it's also very good at priming combos, helpful at taking out shields and offers better damage against boss armor. I'm mostly going to focus on the acolyte in this post though. 

For mods, you absolutely need a high caliber barrel on the acolyte, otherwise you won't be able to one-shot phantom barriers. For the other slot on the acolyte I like to take the power magnifier, though on gold it isn't really necessary to cross any damage thresholds. On platinum it's invaluable however. 

* **Gear and consumables**

As gear, there is only one, grenade capacity. You can never have enough grenades. If you don't have grenade capacity you still get four grenades, so it's not the end of the world. In that case I would take an adaptive war amp. 

For armor equipment, this depends on difficulty. On gold you don't need a power amp for any thresholds *(one exception: you need a power amp I to one shot rocket troopers with lift grenades)*, which means that you are free to use either cyclonic modulators for extra tankiness, or adrenaline mods for faster grenade acquisition and even better mobility. 

On platinum I highly recommend a power amp IV, otherwise you wont be able to take out the tougher ground enemies with two lift grenades. 

As ammo you definitely want incendiary. It allows you to detonate fire explosions everywhere and also gives you good damage against boss armor. 

Finally, the weapon amp depends on difficulty again. On gold, take a rail amp for your hurricane (or whatever you are using). On platinum take a pistol rail amp for the acolyte, otherwise you wont be able to one shot phantom barriers. 

---

Gameplay:
-

You have three very powerful attacks that combine together really well: 

* **Acolyte** 

Shots will prime any enemy they hit for a fire explosion and strip any shield from every single ground enemy on gold (and on platinum if you take pistol rail amp III). 

Always keep the acolyte charged up, and release the trigger when you want to fire. That way you always have panic button ready in case your charge is on cooldown and you need to stun an enemy until you can charge again. 

If you have the acolyte ready to fire and then charge, the shot will release automatically and for the most part hit the enemy you are charging before your charge hits, which means you get an instant fire explosion.  

* **Charge** 

Will detonate any fire explosions primed by the acolyte, as well as any combos primed by teammates. With this build charge also has a huge amount of force (almost 2000N), which means that health enemies are almost guaranteed to die from the ragdoll. 

On gold every ground enemy will die to one acolyte shot and charge (except dragoons and pyros). 

* **Lift grenades**

With all the power buffs, these things do 3100 damage to health/armor/shield and 4650 to barriers. That means one lift grenade kills all the basic troopers (and rocket troopers), and two grenades kill *everything*, including phantoms, pyros and possessed captains. 

Ravagers die to three grenades. Brutes take five, scions take 6 and banshees take eight. Atlases and praetorians take many.    

Lift grenades also have a large radius, which means that they will kill three phantoms just as good as one. Also makes them particularly good against geth, because they like to run in groups. 

The grenades also can actually detonate combos on health enemies, however considering that there isn't a single enemy that has enough health to survive a lift grenade in the first place, this really doesn't matter much. You'll get some extra free aoe damage every now and again. 

**About bosses**

None of this is particularly awesome against bosses, though the class is pretty good at taking out shields and barriers - lift grenades do x1.5 damage against barriers and the acolyte is obviously pretty good at taking out shields. Against armor you'll just have to use your secondary weapon, or get really spammy with the lift grenades.

But hey, a hurricane or piranha with incendiary ammo III or IV isn't too bad at taking out bosses, even without any good weapon skills. 

Naturally, this class pairs very well with classes that are mostly focused on taking out bosses, for example a particle rifle user or a javelin sniper. You take out the small/elite stuff, and he takes out the biggies. 

**Factions**

Reapers and collectors are the harder factions with this class, because their bosses are so though (and they have brutes/scions). However she is still an amazing class against them. Focus on taking out the smaller enemies (and ravagers) and kill the barriers on the bosses.    
For the boss armor, hopefully your team will help you out, otherwise you might have some trouble.     
Additionally, thanks to the asari dodge, you can safely charge abominations and praetorians, just dodge back immediately after charge hits. 

And while the asari is awesome against reapers and collectors, she is *godlike* against cerberus and geth. Lift grenades will destroy *everything*, the only things lleft standing will be primes and atlases.    
Against geth, if you are using any power amp you will be able to kill rocket troopers with one lift grenade, which is just stupid.

I didn't do platinum for this one because a) [I've done way too many plat solos lately](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1a50vi/field_report_doing_lodestar_the_hard_way/) and b) playing this class in a platinum solo would look quite different from how I actually play her in a normal game (much less charging, more running around, more acolyte spam). 

So in this case I feel doing a gold would paint a better picture of how to play this class. 

I think this is one of the best games of mecoop that I've ever played and I'm extremely proud of it.   
10 waves survived with a squishy vanguard is sweet (and lucky!). Less than 25 minutes is great. 

Both combined in one game is beyond amazing for me. 

I also think that this video does a great job of showing just how *ridiculous* this class is. 

*Note: I'm using a cyclonic modulator in the video, which I don't usually feel is necessary. However with bonus power in chage the asari is pretty squishy for a solo and I didn't want to respec to barrier just for one game. Normally I would use a power amp for unknown enemies and adrenaline mods for cerberus.* 

---

Alternate builds
---

Part of the reason I love the asari vanguard so much is that there are so many viable ways to build her. The build I showed here is a very ""try-hard"" way to play her and while this is probably the most powerful build for her, it's not necessarily the most interesting.

Here are some other awesome builds that you can check out:

* [Check here if you want to play a stasis sniper.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/112yl2/the_asari_commando_asari_vanguard_sniper/) I would recommend the kishock or the black widow over the viper though. Shredder went a little too far with the crazy there. 

* [Look here for aaron's take on a very versatile stasis-headshot-shotgun build.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11xz2c/council_operative_vanguard/) I personally don't feel that 6 ranks in stasis do you all that much good, but this is still a very powerful build. 

* [Check multidisciplinary's post here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/15j9ic/asari_vanguard_chargennuke/) if you want a lift grenade focused build that is a little more weapon heavy than mine, and doesn't skip out on stasis.

* xcalizorz/the3nd also did [a video with a similar build](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myO0P2YSijI&amp;feature=share&amp;list=SPE61EC5FF7149FF45) a while ago, with the talon. Not really sure what his reasoning for the warp ammo is. Also looks like he might be using weapon synergy on charge, the lift grenades look a little weak in the vid. 

---

Random tips
---

* **Host the game**

Seriously, playing vanguards off-host is not fun, especially if you are using the acolyte, because the combo priming doesn't work instantly like on host. If you really want to play the asari vanguard without hosting, I would recommend aaron's build. Not with the graal though. 

* **Thermal packs!**

Use them! They are awesome. 

* **Phantoms (and dragoons)**

If you are playing cerberus (or platinum) make killing phantoms your first priority. Acolyte + charge, acolyte + lift grenade or two lift grenades all do the trick, phantoms are extremely easy to kill with this class. You can deplete the wave budget very quickly this way (as seen in my video). 

* **Banshees**

If you have to kill a banshee by yourself, first take out the barriers with lift grenades and acolyte, until she stops teleporting. 

At this point she also starts doing her hand of denial thing, which sucks because neither lift grenades nor charge will do anything to her. There are two windows in which she is vulnerable however, after she throws a warp-ball at you, and after she does her screamo aoe attack. 

This works out perfectly, because after you get hit be either of these attacks you want to charge anyway to get rid of the damage over time effect. After she throws the warp ball the window is pretty short, and you probably can only get one lift grenade in before she blocks again. After the screamo attack, you can do two or three grenades. 

* **Praetorians**

You want to avoid bringing up their power-block-bubble. If they are floating, don't charge them and don't throw lift grenade directly at them, otherwise they will raise the bubble. You can still throw lift grenades at the floor in front of them however. 

Additionally, as long as you dodge back immediately after charge hits, the praetorian won't sync kill you.

BUILD: http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Engineer/Human/PLLID/Paladin4BP5AI5//PistolRailAmp3/PowerAmplifierModule3/ShieldBooster5/

POWERS:

Combat drone - it's Mr. Splodey.  You want your drone to be as close to your enemies as possible, because when it explodes, it detonates tech bursts, and it can stagger enemies pretty well.

Incinerate - nothing new here.  Standard (IMHO) build for a human engineer.  Damage, burn damage, and armor damage.  For armored enemies, BURN THEM!

Overload - This is great for crowd control, and can strip the shields/barriers of almost any enemy.

Weapon - Paladin.  I used to run a Carnifex, but when i switched to the Paladin, i found myself killing more units, and i got my first 25 pistol kill medal.  For someone with my set of skills (not many), i find that impressive on a power based class.  Power magnifier is nice for MOAR DAMAGE, the small mag size demands the extended mag.  If you can reliably hit headshots, switch the extended mag for the headshot mod.

GEAR/EQUIPMENT:

Pistol amp is obvious.  Power amp is good.  I also like shield booster, so you're not constantly living on the edge of shield gate.  You could go cyc mod for equipment, and power amp for gear, but RNG doesn't want me to have cyc mods.  


TACTICS:

Remember the drone.  Each time you see a big boss, or three plus enemies spawn a drone.  For less enemies, it's not that useful, but YMMV.

For shielded enemies, overload.  For armored enemies, incinerate.

Yup.

I have done very well with this build, topping a gold scoreboard, if that matters to you.

**BIOTiC CHARGE**
The first three ranks are nothing special, obviously so i'm just gonna skip ahead to ranks 4, 5, and 6. 

* **Rank 4**: Fairly standard, and the ability to stagger multiple enemies at once makes for a great way to escape with such a squishy character.

* **Rank 5**: We're gonna roll with weapon damage on this one. Since this build has no points into cluster grenades, and pull isn't meant to be used as a damaging power by itself, there is no reason to take power damage. This also lets the Piranha we slapped on this MassEffect-UsainBolt do ridiculous amounts of damage.

* **Rank 6**: While most builds will take the full barrier evolution over the 50% cool down chance, I wanted to try something new. Turns out that in my opinion, the cool down chance evolution is one of the best, if not the best, evolutions for a power in the entire game, right up there with Shield Drain on Annihilation Field and Shield Penetration on Lash. 
This evolution says it gives you a fifty percent chance of not having Biotic Charge trigger a cool down, but something tells me the chance is much, much, higher. While playing, I could sometimes manage 6 charges in a row, with 5 being a little less rare and 4 happening on a fairly consistent basis. The evo allows you to stun-lock enemies like crazy, also giving you the option to dash out of a sticky situation when it does work. Being able to charge twice in a row also practically gives you the Full Barrier Restore, while giving you double the damage. In tandem with the multiple target evolution in rank 4, you can often keep 3-4 enemies under control with relative ease.


**PULL**
Pull is a somewhat situational power, but since the Piranha was nerfed, (8 in a clip to 6 in a clip) Pull synergizes very well with the gun. Often mooks will be left with their shields stripped but not dead due to the accuracy of the Piranha, even with a smart choke attached. Pull renders those who do survive useless, and also sets them up for a very powerful biotic explosion, which kills mostly all the other mooks around for the explosion.

* **Rank 4**: Duration is gonna be taken here allowing us to leave lesser enemies disabled so we can focus on the bigger ones. Simple, doesn't need much explanation. Also, I don't see the merit in radius since this guy isn't gonna be spawn nuking a whole lot, and thus isn't gonna often see multiple enemies within a 2.5 meter radius.

* **Rank 5**: This evolution is one I'm not so sure about, but i took Damage Taken so that if there ever was a situation where it was just one measly trooper with nothing else to focus on, he would die even faster. Honestly, both evos in Rank 5 aren't very good to me so if you want the DOT evolution instead you could also take that.


* **Rank 6** We're gonna go with the Biotic Explosion evo so when we need to, we can make one of the biggest booms possible. You can purposely leave someone unshielded so you can Pull them and then Charge to kill any enemies around with a quick explosion. Also, the other Rank 6 evo is fairly useless since the cool down on Pull is already so quick that it isn't needed.


**PASSIVES**
These are pretty simple choices, so I'm not gonna go in depth with these. 

* **Drell Assassin**:
Take all the Power Damage evos and then the Weapon Damage evo in rank six so our piranha can spit out even more death. 

* **Fitness**:
Take all Durability, not so much for the extra health and shields, but for the crazy speed boosts this guy has.


**WEAPONS**

For my weapon choice on this guy, i went with the Piranha. Using the smart choke and high velocity barrel, the cool down time is exactly at 150% due to the extra weight capacity that the DrellGuard comes with. The Piranha is a beast of a weapon, and will tear apart anything within close range. Since this is a Vanguard, he's going to be in close range most of the time anyways, making the gun a perfect fit. It can see some decent distance with the smart choke, but you will definitely have a hard time hitting the smaller targets, so try to keep it as a close range weapon. (this isn't a TSol with a claymore, alright?)



After using this guy for a bit, i reached his potential. I played 3 gold matches with him, 2 against Collectors and 1 against Cerberus. In all these matches, I topped the scoreboard with more than 150k points in each match. Collectors became a joke from how fast I killed things. Atlas mechs? Dropping in under 15 seconds easily.
It is also wise to use Incendiary Ammo for fire explosions, or Warp Ammo so you can kill things faster.



**SIDENOTE** /u/SimplyWaffle can attest to me killing things crazy fast and topping the scoreboards every game. Seriously, ask him. I dare you. HE CAN ALSO ATTEST TO ME PULLING OFF 5 CHARGES IN A ROW.

*In my opinion this is one of the strongest classes in the game right now, and here is exactly how I build and play him.*

-

*This is the exact build I use in the video, but there are some debatable evolutions:*

* **Rank 6 shockwave**

In my opinion the hilarious moments lifting shockwave produces are enough reason to take it. But logically, recharge speed is probably the better choice. 

* **Rank 6 barrier vs. ranks 1, 2 and 3 of Berserker**

Taking recharge speed on barrier gives you slightly quicker cooldowns than the capacity from rank 1 in the passives, but you are missing out on 7.5% weapon and power damage. I'm really not sure about this one, could go either way. 

Keep in mind that neither shockwave nor warp profits very much from power damage and the incendiary ammo damage is not affected by weapon damage bonuses.

In my video I have 3 points in berserker, but I recorded that quite a while ago and have since switched to a 6/6/6/0/6 build. But honestly, the difference either way is minimal. 

* **Rank 6 warp**

This depends on what ammo you plan on using. If you go with incendiary (my recommendation), definitely go with pierce, as it will increase the bugged incendiary/warp damage. 

But if you intend to use warp ammo, pierce becomes useless (with warp ammo IV you'll have 100% armor weakening anyway) and you might as well take recharge speed. 

---

**Weapons**
-

Yeah.... Reegar. It's the best suited gun to abuse the warp/incendiary bug, and it is also a way to easily get rid of any nasty shields in the way of the delicious incendiary damage. 

If you don't want to use the reegar, but still want to take advantage of the warp bug, hurricane, harrier or piranha are good choices. 

If you don't want to use the reegar and you don't want to abuse the bug, I would recommend either the talon, or a combo of acolyte and either wraith, hurricane, graal or any other high dps weapon, all with warp ammo.

If you are okay with the reegar, but don't want to abuse the bug, take warp ammo instead. With the extra damage against primed targets, this can get almost as ridiculous as with incendiary ammo. 

For gear, I personally like stacking more shield-recharge on class that already have bonuses to it, so I'm a big fan of stronghold pack for this class (so much that I used it instead of armored compartments for my platinum solo). 

For armor equipment, there are three options. If you want extra tankiness take cyclonics, if you want almost instant shield regen, take shield power cells. And if you want more mobility, take adrenaline mods. 

---

**Gameplay**
-

The general idea is to hit enemies with warp, then shoot them with incendiary ammo and then detonate with shockwave to finish them off. The *incredible* tankiness and stagger resistance of a krogan with barrier allows you to stay right in the face of enemies without having too much trouble staying alive. 

This leads to a krogan vanguard-ish playstyle, but thanks to warp's debuff and the buggy incendiary damage (or alternatively, the warp ammo damage against primed targets) you can expect much higher damage than from a vanguard. 

My love for shield-recharge on this kit ties into this. In normal games, shield power cells are my equipment of choice, and that leads to almost instant shield-regen.

Yay, finally did collectors platinum. As I have absolutely zero intention of doing geth, this is probably my last plat solo for a while. These things are stressful. 

Unfortunately I only recorded the first 6 waves, because my hard drive was full (...). But [here is the end scorescreen](http://i.imgur.com/g9kWq3V.jpg) in case you are interested. 

A couple of quick questions/comments:

* Cyonan's enemy spawn spreadsheet is wrong for platinum collectors (especially wave 5, I was really scared of that one after looking at the sheet, but there were neither phantoms nor dragoons). Does anyone have a correct version?

* God damn, wave 10 collectors is retarded. 2 praetorians, 2 primes and 2 banshees. What are you even supposed to kill there?

* Other than that collectors were much easier than I expected. The lack of phantoms, hunters and dragoons is very pleasant for a platinum solo.

**How to incendiary/warp bug**
-

*I know that not everyone is a fan of abusing this and some people even think that this is cheating. In my opinion there are two reasons why this is fair game:* 

*a) If bioware thought this was a game breaking issue that shouldn't be used then they should at least* attempt *to fix it, which they haven't.* 

*b) The incendiary stacking bug is basically unavoidable in normal gameplay, they only way to not use it would be to never use incendiary ammo. Getting rid of bugs is the developer's responsibility, not mine. I'm not going to limit my gameplay options because they don't do it.*

*You don't have to agree with me on this, but this is my reasoning for why this is okay. If you disagree, I can understand that. This build is also very viable using warp ammo instead, so if you don't want to use the bug, I recommend doing that.* 

Now, to explain the strange incendiary mechanics, I'm shamelessly copying my own post from IPTF's incendiary ammo thread. 

Let's start with how incendiary ammo is supposed to work. Every shot should do the amount stated (30%/50%) in the ammo description, of the base weapon damage. That is the value found in the weapon stats spreadsheet.

So for a weapon with a base damage of 1000 and incendiary III, it should do 300 incendiary damage. That damage is applied over 3 seconds after the impact, with two ticks per second. That means every tick is going to do 300/6 = 50 damage, or 100 damage per second.

As long as you only shoot a target once, this works as intended, but with multiple shots (inside the 3 second window) the stacking bug occurs.

Imagine you fire two shots with the 1000 base damage weapon. After the first shot the incendiary does two normal ticks of 50 damage. Then you shoot again.
What should happen now, is that the first shot finishes his remaining 4 ticks and the second does his 6 ticks, so that each shot does the stated 300 incendiary damage.

In reality, what happens is that after the second shot is fired, the two incendiary effects get mushed together, there damage is combined. So after the second shot, the incendiary effect does 6 ticks of 100 damage, instead of 4 ticks with 50 from the first shot and 6 ticks with 50 from the second shot, for a total of 700 incendiary damage instead of the intended 600. 

(In real reality, this isn't quite the whole truth, the stacking is even more bugged than this, but it doesn't really matter).

You can imagine that this leads to ludicrous damage if you shoot a target multiple times very quickly. With rapid fire weapons you can expect incendiary ammo to to about 2 or 3 times as much damage as stated.

Now enter warp and things get really weird. Warp has a small dot component that works for 10 seconds after warp is applied (the damage of this is usually insignificant).

Now, for some reason if you shoot a warped target with incendiary the incendiary effect gets absorbed by the warp effect. What does that mean?

Well, first of all, it means that any incendiary damage that is applied after warp will be labeled as ""warp"" in the kill feed. This is very important, because the incendiary ammo being applied as ""warp"" means that the incendiary ammo gets warp's multipliers against defenses (3.25 against barriers, 2.5 against armor, 1 against health and 0.5 against shields).

This means that in combination with warp, incendiary ammo works on shields and barriers (normally it does zero damage to these) and it gets higher damage against armor.

This is were the majority of the increased damage for the warp/incendiary comes from (expect about 4 or 5 times the stated damage). (Again, not the whole truth, but if you want more detail it gets ridiculously complicated).

Additionally, for some reason if you apply two warps before incendiary ammo, the damage gets completely insane (you can expect up to 10 times the stated incendiary damage.) As far as I know this part is a complete mystery to everyone and I have no explanation why a second warp makes such a big difference.

Here are a couple of example of how this looks in gameplay:

[12:40 - Possessed scion with one warp](http://youtu.be/uLfDhND3Mjc?t=12m40s)   
[15:20 - Banshee (incendiary damage on barrier)](http://youtu.be/uLfDhND3Mjc?t=15m20s)

Now you might be thinking *NOT ANOTHER GODDAMN HUMAN SOLDIER! PLEASE DON'T DO IT.* This may be a true statement as the Human Soldier seems to be quite popular on BBLoB. But I think I have come with [something interesting. Something unique and fun that is both specialized in destroying the enemy and working with a team, yet effective regardless of how far down the weapon card tree you are](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/Human/ONIDR/NValkyrie2AE5AD5////WarfighterPackage5/). So in the interest of having a bit of fun, here's a narrative of an operative in the field describing what he thinks is the best way to outfit human soldiers under his command. There will be two comments below describing the tactics, equipment, and evolution choices in greater detail. I should warn you that this is a very long post and it might make mrcle123 feel better about his super long posts.

If you don't feel like reading through the entire fanfiction that is mostly lore-friendly (with a few references here and there), I'll give a short summary. This build is a power and weapon dependent build that should work well with any tiering of weapons (Commons, Uncommons, Rares, and Ultra-Rares). Adrenaline Rush is geared towards amping weapon damage to bosses and swaths of enemies. Concussive Shot is geared towards knocking down lone targets, starting bleed damage on organics, detonating Tech Combos, and eviscerating Barriers. Frag Grenades are designed to stun a group of enemies and detonating Tech Combos while in Adrenaline Rush. Fitness is geared towards defenses while the investment into Alliance Training is dwarfed by the advantages gain in taking higher ranks into powers and Fitness.

**New Operatives**

I can hardly remember what day it is today. Life has been sent upside down ever since the Reapers hit Earth. This program logs the date anyways, so there's no point for me to write it down here.  This war can't end soon enough.

Ever since the Reapers landed, I've been one of the few chosen to lead the N7 strike teams against the Reapers. Well, they aren't officially all N7s. In fact, not all of them are even humans. I've got Krogan, Turians, Asari, and Salarians under my command. Even those who I would never expect to have a commanding position over such as the Vorcha, Volus, and Geth fall under my scope of operations. All these aliens work comparatively or even better than the few N7 graduates in my disposal. Even then, not all the human operatives are N7 graduates. Some are just technical specialists that do good with their Omnitool, a few have a distinct mastery with biotics (they scare me, I mean they can kill me with their mind), and now I get a few basic recruits to join them.

Now don't get me wrong, I love the extra help they can provide. But it seems that these grunts don't mesh well with any team really. A lot of them seem to act like lone wolves, shooting anything that moves regardless of the situation. While this may help out in a few situations, this behavior cannot be sustained. What's even worse is that [it's](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/s84mf/comprehensive_rmecoop_thread/c4eh8i9?context=3) [a](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/xeyll/the_onetwo_punch_human_soldier_build/) [popular](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/12lxdz/i_am_heavy_weapons_guy_and_this_is_my_weapon/) [mentality](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/11ujau/doubledouble_barrels_at12_raider_human_soldier/) too. It seems to me that the issue is that the suit cannot provide power to both an adrenal dispenser and a concussive amplifier without shortchanging grenade capacity, so most opt for the more versatile adrenal dispenser and supplement the concussive amplifier with fragmentation grenades. I've seen some [experienced](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/vo9s2/the_human_paladin_soldier_crusader_build/) [operatives](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/14gv3x/the_grenadier_human_soldier/) under my command that performed adequately in using all the tools given to them and I am inspired to find a way for new recruits to bring them straight up to speed on what I think are the best tactics.

I'll give those guys a lecture about teamwork tomorrow morning, but I don't think it's going to do anyone any good. I have a feeling that the new guy Johnson will be the one that takes it least to heart. His best friend Baker seems to encourage his behavior, so I'll keep an eye out. While he may think his mastery over biotics and his love of football will help him out in combat, it doesn't give him an excuse to act like this on my ship. He's not like most of the biotics as he does have some combat training, which may help in the future.

________________________________________________________________
**Tinkering Around**

Boy that lecture went over *swell*. The new recruits rotating under my command didn't take my speech about teamwork and survival very well. Johnson his sarcastic demeanor afterwords won't earn him any favors. He's going to get extra KP duty tonight for that. Baker too is going to be stuck cleaning the kitchen for encouraging Johnson to act like that. They'll probably talk about football or something like that, but as long as I can get them to work that would be nice.

I've noticed that these new operatives are only equipped with basic Devlon and Rosenkov Materials armor. I guess the Alliance really is grabbing everything they can to outfit us with *something* to fight. Even their weapons are basic, consisting of the basic Avenger from the Elkoss Combine and a few other assorted weapons like the Katana, Vindicator, Mattock, Tempest, and Eviscerator. Not bad, but they don't hit with enough force to fight the toughest battles. 

While I'll certainly requisition the Alliance for better weapons, I feel that the armor is going to need a bigger upgrade. Most of these grunts tend to have only adrenal modules for increased weapon amping and skip on powering a concussive amplifier on their gun. I hear from Hahne-Kedar that the issue seems to be that the power supply is too weak to support both systems on the same piece of armor effectively. Now that I think about it, I do have some Ariake power bricks that seem to be highly effective in creating the necessary energy to power both systems and they don't seem to be too complicated to manufacture. I'll send a few to my pal at Hahne-Kedar and hopefully he can mix the two together. I don't think Ariake is going to mind considering everything is going straight to hell right now and the last thing we need is two of the biggest corporations in Alliance space fighting over how to protect our infantry in combat in the name of credits. I'll write a letter to Ariake just in case.

_______________________________________________________________
**New Equipment**

It's been a few weeks since I sent those bricks to my pal at Hahne-Kedar and a requisition to the Alliance for better weapons. It seems the valor of my squads on Arvuna, Cyone, Palaven, and even Earth has earned enough recognition for the Alliance to send plenty of armaments and equipment my way. Looks like it pays to do the shit jobs no one else wants to do. I've also noticed that some officers have been clumsy with their hard drives in combat, but I'm just glad that it isn't *my* guys losing them.

I am literally swimming in equipment here. And I mean literally. The rest of the crew doesn't like it trying to find the equipment they need by pushing crates left and right before finding the right one. I have more than enough Thermal Clip Packs on hand that I encourage operatives to use grenades as a force multiplier if they are ever outnumbered and outgunned. It also seems that I got the cream of the crop as I see Cerberus Harriers, Revenants, N7 Crusaders, AT-12 Raiders, ""standard issue"" Valkyries (supposed to be available for everyone but someone screwed that one up), N7 Hurricanes, and many other weapons appearing in these crates from the Alliance. Also I seem to be loaded with temporary cyclonic modulators, stabilization modules, weapon amps, AP/Drill ammo, and more packages than I know what to do with. I'm so loaded with equipment sometimes I wonder how this ship can carry this much equipment and still be nimble. Probably something-something mass effect fields.

What I find even more exciting is that I got a couple of packages from my pal at H-K. Inside were a series of modified N7 Defender armor with those power bricks I sent them. It appears that H-K and Ariake worked together quickly to make a simple yet powerful armor that can be worn by those those with minimal combat training and built at nearly any colony with a factory planetside. Looks like Udina's words of putting every colony to work is finally having an effect. The armor seems to have extra room for plenty of fragmentation grenades, which will be useful as these 'N7' squads always seem to be outnumbered.  

I'm even more surprised that the armor seems to have both a Binary Helix adrenaline dispenser AND an H-K concussive launcher power cell right next to each other. It seems that it is possible to have soldiers go into both an Adrenaline Rush and shoot Concussive Shots [without switching armor pieces](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/Human/ONIDR/NValkyrie2AE5AD5////WarfighterPackage5/).

**Lose Some, Win Some**

Today was a tough day. I was observing Johnson's cam as I wanted to see how he handled the new suit from H-K and I was quite pleased. It took him some time to adjust being able to use both the adrenal dispenser, concussive amplifier, and frags effectively in unison, but he finally got the hang of it. I even learned that an concussive blast powered by the suit can destabilize explosive plasma on targets in addition to power surges caused by omnitools. I forgot that the techs made those upgrades and I will definitely try to [pair these recruits with the combat engineers](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1388bf/it_takes_two_to_tango_human_ingenuity/) in the future.

Unfortunately the cost of learning it was high. Baker was deployed with Johnson, Kat (a combat engineer), and Selena (an N7 graduate specialized in close range biotics) on a Cerberus lab in Noveria. CDR Shepard already took down the defenses but it appears Cerberus came back with force to retake it. Cerberus got a fight and we gave them one. It was going well until Baker was pinned behind cover while an Atlas mech with low armor integrity was encroaching on him. Selena was running around picking any stragglers she could find while Johnson and Kat were rushing to help Baker get out of cover. In his haste, Baker decided that the best way to get out of the situation was to biotically energize himself and charge straight into the Atlas. Normally this is an excellent tactic provided that Baker could escape. However a sneaky Cerberus Phantom was behind the Atlas and slashed Baker as soon as he landed in front of the Atlas, stunning him in the process. This gave the Atlas a window to pick up Baker with its left arm. Kat sent a  plasma bolt to try and finish off the Atlas while Johnson launched a Concussive Shot as he tried to get into range with his Revenant. The Atlas crushed Baker's body with its hand, but not soon after the plasma bolt and Concussive Shot landed right after one another, causing the mech to violently explode and killing both the Phantom and Atlas mech in one go. The rest of the squad extracted successfully, but Baker remained dead. I could see Johnson's pain after the mission, but I think he just needs some time to recover from the loss of his best friend. He can't dwell on the past given the galactic situation at hand.

After mourning Baker's death, it looks like he took the teammate speech from when he first came on to heart. I saw him talking with other operatives about teamwork and synergy between squadmates. Not just synergy between equipment and weapons, but personality and tactics as well. I saw the results quickly: operations now take 7% faster to complete and the equipment consumed has been cut by half. Even on the toughest operations, those who took his words of encouragement to heart come back from ops alive and in record time. If I ever get promoted, I hope he gets to take my place.

The Adas Anti-Synthetic Rifle, the Chakram Launcher (more or less confirmed by OneTrueShot), the Executioner Pistol, the Punisher SMG, the Venom Shotgun are the only weapons left from single-player that have yet to come over to join us in the multiplayer.

First off, are they any good?  Do they fill a role that we don't have a tool for already?  Do they render any existing weapons more or less obsolete, Harrier-style?

It was also indicated that Reaper Adjutants will soon be joining us.  The only time I played through the Omega DLC, I was level 60 and pretty much killed them as soon as they popped up, so other than leaving a Ravager-esque goo puddle, I'm not sure what their capabilities are or what effect they will have on games vs Reapers in general.

1358425794.0,26,self.MECoOp,16qyh7,"ME Co-Op College- Races 111: Salarians
",32,6,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16qyh7/me_coop_college_races_111_salarians/,"Woefully underrepresented in MP, the Salarians are a Council race that focus on stealth, sabotage and deception as opposed to raw firepower. There are currently two kits, the infiltrator and the engineer, both of which were release kits.

**Racial Passive and Fitness**

Pretty lightweight in the fitness stakes, though Energy Drain helps with that, and with an evo to reduce sniper rifle weight at rank 6 of the racial (more useful for the SE). The dodge is the standard nonhuman sidehop, and neither melee is anything to write home about. 

**Salarian Infiltrator**

A fine infiltrator kit, one of the most powerful upon release, these days superseded by the GI in DPS stakes (albeit only just, check out mrcle123's comparison in the comments). Still offers more survivability.

* Tac Cloak: Standard infiltrator variant. 
* Energy Drain: A very useful power. Restores shields, detonates techsplosions on synthetic and shielded enemies, and can grant the user a layer of damage resistance at rank 6. Be careful when working with biotic teammates so as not to override their primers especially on armoured targets. Also handy for staggering enemies to set up headshots. Note that the shield drain aspect of ED makes him capable of using single-shot SRs WITHOUT phasic ammo and killing with that one shot. Especially as cloak-power-shoot means the CD of the power is overriden by the CD of cloak (applies to both ED and PM). 
* Proximity Mine: Covered elsewhere, but excellent debuffing tool. Also sets off techsplosions. The debuff at rank 5 is almost mandatory.

The basic variants are your sniper and shotgun infiltratror. ED lends the SI a degree of survivability that few other infiltrators can boast. My go-to guy for sniping with most SRs, and for PUGs where I'll need to clutch, most likely. Also a fine kit to take to Plat for the first time as it combines high DPS and good survivability (especially compared to other infiltrators, for whom recovering shields can be an issue. SI can skip that via ED.). Shines against all factions but probably strongest against Geth.

**Salarian Engineer**

Once the farmer's dream, the SE has dropped slowly out of use by most players as changes to the game have seen him become less and less powerful. The nerf to the pets, and Decoy in particular, hit him hard. Still, in the right hands, a kit that can still be played effectively

* Decoy: Once his signature power (now available to the Volus Sentinel as well), Decoy used to be broken. You could cluster entire Geth or Reaper spawns around one, and rain havoc down on them. Having one was what made FBWGG so ridiculous, partially. Then it got nerfed hard, especially as melee enemies ignored them. Now use it situationally i.e. place it in doorways. Never let the enemy see you place it, it will not draw their attention. The best way to get a feel for it is to simply practice with it. Also note you can't place it too far away from your current position when initially casting it.
* Energy Drain: As above
* Incinerate: Strong anti-armour power, good synergy with ED especially against synthetic units. Covered in-depth in earlier guides.

A kit that is still strong against the Geth in particular, but also useful with other enemies. I'd recommend a hard-hitting weapon that is slightly heavier, as there should be little need to spam powers. Wraith or indeed Claymore make excellent choices, as do the middle-tier SRs (Valiant etc). Despite having two of the same powers as the Paladin, a comparison between the two falls short due to the massive differences in playstyle thanks to SF/Omnishield and Decoy.  

**Conclusion**

The SI continues to remain one of the best kits in the game, and these days, is probably somewhat underrated. For newer players looking to transition to a higher difficulty level or get used to sniping, I highly recommend him. The SE needs something, hopefully a buff of some description is forthcoming, but he is by no means unusable. And right at the top of my wishlist for future DLC is more Salarian kits in general...

So we deemed it necessary to lay out the video policy for /r/MeCoOp.

As this sub is generally dedicated to advice and strategy instead of random happenings in the multiplayer, we want to limit the type of video content that can get posted. So this is how it works:

- **No random videos, gameplays or commentaries UNLESS they're a visual example accompanying a selfpost guide or build** for classes/weapons/maps. The video should compliment the guide, not the other way round, and the text guide should be the focus of the submission, not the video. Example: I make a Volus Adept build post, and in the post I link to some gameplay footage of me demonstrating how to play this build. If you want to post a video from your favourite commentator or something random you captured in game, you're more than welcome to submit it to our sister subreddit, /r/masseffect.

- Videos of stuff like protips or bug exploits are fine (example: [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE9z0unzVys)), **but they should be accompanied by a text description** for those who can't access YouTube. Summarise the video. Explain in the text description the theory behind what you're showing in the video. Watching it should not be essential to get your point across as not everyone will be able to do so.

- To that end, **selfposts are preferable to just video submissions.** This is to ensure the video is not posted for selfish reasons, ie. promoting your own or someone else's channel. It also makes the accompanying text the focus instead of the video itself. **Videos should be supplementary in nature**, and should only be linked if you feel a visual demonstration is necessary.

- **Streams must be announced in a self post, then deleted upon ending.** This is similar to /r/starcraft's policy and prevents posts from cluttering up the front page.

I hope this clarifies things. We're not anti-videos, we'd just like to limit submissions in order to preserve the integrity of this subreddit.

Also did some math. Results are absolutely sublime - the damage you deal against armour is insane.*

[***Fire! I'll take you to burn...doo doo doo...***](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4ExW1Fx0-k)

Remember when the patch came out all those weeks ago? There was something in there about Carnage priming Fire Explosions. And my immediate thought was ""wow that'll be pretty cool for BF3 soldier, seeing as he would actually have a way of using Carnage as a primer."" But until recently I didn't bother trying anything out. Now, I've spent some time experimenting, and I've found something I really like. No longer will the BF3 soldier be just another AR soldier, variety is the name of the game and we're going to make full use of his powers to turn him into a really unique class.

[Build](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#13AQMPR%5B9%400PEI%40L4N4%400%400)

Yes, I am skipping Adrenaline Rush. It's not the focus of this build. The focus is instead, FIRE EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE MWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! Besides, the Reegar is freakishly strong already and really doesn't need the extra damage.

The Battlefield 3 soldier is unique in that he's the only class with Carnage that can actually reliably use it as a primer for fire explosions instead of a detonator. The Vorcha and Krogan Soldiers rely on priming FEs with Flamer and Inferno Grenades, and the window in which Carnage primes is too short for Kroguard to make use of it. So this guy can set off max level FEs, really quickly. Frag grenades are a really good detonator because they're grenades and don't run off cooldowns, meaning you can get through the short window of opportunity and set off big explosions on targets. Most people have only seen Incendiary ammo FEs so they aren't aware of just how devastating a max level combo is to armour. A Carnage-Frag combo will deal in total around 6000 damage. This is damn near half of a Gold Brute's HP and more than kills a Dragoon outright. It wipes a couple armour bars off an Atlas with each hit, and unlike incendiary ammo it's not bugged so you can do multiple combos in quick succession. You can then throw a second Frag Grenade while waiting for Carnage to come off cooldown to do another 2500+ damage before launching into your next combo. Pretty devastating. And this doesn't even factor in the additional DoT that's supposed to happen with a Fire Explosion, but supposedly that's bugged.

So that's for bosses. For low-level enemies, you can use Reegar with incendiary ammo to prime, then either Carnage or a grenade to detonate. In fact, you probably don't even need to bother with combos on mooks, the Reegar melts everything that's not armoured anyway. The Reegar also provides your shield stripping abilities, which is why Frags are spec'd for armour damage instead. The attachments I used in the build generator are not definitive; if you don't like the Reegar's low spare ammo count you can swap out the barrel for the extra capacity mod, but seeing as you're a grenade class, I would argue spare ammo isn't a necessity if you're going to be frequenting the boxes anyway. Shredder Mod is a must though. I would recommend taking weapon damage in the last rank of class passive over more cooldown increases for Carnage just so you don't have to reload to strip everything's shields.


Because frags are pretty central to your boss killing ability, I do not recommend taking Shock Trooper gear over Grenade Capacity V, you will need to have as many grenades at your disposal as possible. You could take Max Grenades at rank 5 instead if you feel 7 isn't enough but you'll be missing out on that delicious bleed damage, and any DoT effect is worth getting.

So in short, we're stressing diversity in our soldier class and finding a cool niche for the BF3 kit to fill instead of being just another AR guy.

1351127440.0,26,self.MECoOp,121gdm,Flip McNeely:  Drell Vanguard Melee Build,28,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/121gdm/flip_mcneely_drell_vanguard_melee_build/,"Before you get your pitchforks and torches, please keep in mind that this is not intended to be a kickass-carry-your-team-to-victory build.  This set-up is optimized for *fun*.  I mean, seriously, who doesn't like space-karate?  And, I think if played well, this build can be very effective on a variety of difficulties (though I haven't tested Platinum and don't care to).  Just be prepared to use some medi-gels because you are going to die a *tad* (okay, *a lot*) more than you're accustomed to.  So, here goes:

## ***ABSTRACT***

The Drell Vanguard has long been a symbol of weakness among players in the ME3 community.  This guide posits that it is not the Drell who is weak; on the contrary, this association is a projection of the weakness and insecurity extant in us, the players.  Only by confronting this weakness can it be conquered.  To truly achieve self-actualization, one must play as the Drell and endure the humiliation of kick votes and deserted lobbies.  One must mildy annoy his teammates by performing space-ballet between waves.  One must space-kick a Brute in his cornhole.

## ***BUILD***

[Here](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#51QQFFKp9F9PE%40DF4H4E4D4) it is.

*~~Note: Ignore the melee numbers on the character builder because they are not calculated correctly.  The bonus from melee weapon mods is multiplicative, and the bonus from a Strength Enhancer III is 30%, not 100%.  I've left the Strength Enhancer off of the build link because it seems to break it, but you will probably need it if you intend on playing Gold.  I will get to that in the Equipment section.~~*

**Biotic Charge**

For the level 5 evolution, you could go with Weapon or Power Synergy, but I prefer Power.  The Acolyte already does enough damage to strip all lower-tier enemies' shields / barriers in one shot, and most of the time when I'm using my secondary weapon, I'm not doing a lot of Biotic Charging.  But, if you're feeling frisky and like charging bosses and unloading from close range, you could take the Weapon Synergy.  This build won't require the bonuses you get from Power Synergy to be effective.

For the level 6 evolution, for the first time that I recall, I am opting for the Bonus Power.  If you take Barrier, you are only going to get an additional ~170 shields back.  On the other hand, if you opt for Bonus Power, you may be able to get yourself out of some scrapes when you otherwise wouldn't.  Sure, it's unpredictable, but I guarantee it will eventually save your life.

**Pull**

This is pretty straightforward.  The most important thing is the level 6 evolution for the 75% combo damage.

**Cluster Grenades**

In this build, Cluster Grenades are used both for stagger / crowd control (especially defensively), and for setting off biotic explosions on lifted targets.  Now, you might be questioning the strength of a biotic explosion using only a rank 4 power, but worry not.  On Gold, the strength of a biotic explosion on a lifted target (which, by definition will always have health and no shields) detonated by rank 4 Cluster Grenades is 1299.  Add in the 750 (minimum, depending on equipment) damage from the grenade itself, and you have 2049 damage.  Add in another 100 from the application of Pull for 2149, and that's enough to take out the health of every unit capable of being lifted, except for Possessed Collectors.  Remember, the max health of any non-Possessed enemy on Gold is 2025, so that's the threshold you're going to be wanting to look for if you decide to run the numbers for a variation on this build.

**Drell Assassin**

You need to get to that Capacity upgrade.  You're going to be carrying two weapons, and you want to keep the cooldowns on Biotic Charge as low as possible.

**Fitness**

Maxed for melee.  If you went all for shields and health, you would only get an additional 225 and 113 protection, respectively.  Is that worth it?  You're still basically a shield and health gate away from death.  Go with melee.  With Martial Artist active, and the equipment I describe below, your heavy melee does 1875 damage, which is enough to take out the health of several enemies by itself, and when paired with a Charge or Cluster Grenade, most of the other lower-tier enemies in the game.

## ***WEAPONS***

For what I think are obvious reasons, the Acolyte is going to be your primary weapon.  Stripping shields in one shot is going to setup various Pull / Biotic Charge / Cluster Grenade / Melee combinations.

The secondary weapon is for dealing with heavier armored enemies.  Preferably, it should be able to operate at range (so Reegar is out).  You need to keep the cooldown low for survivability, but you also want to bring a weapon that packs some decent DPS.  I settled on the Mattock, as it affords a very respectable DPS while keeping the CD at 180%.  I also used this build with the Kishock Harpoon Gun, but I found the one shot to be a little too unforgiving when dealing with some enemies (damn you Dragoons).  Other options are the Hurricane, Graal Spike Thrower, and GPS.  The cooldown on the latter two, as well as the Kishock, drops to 140%, which is about as far as I'd push it.

## ***EQUIPMENT***

For Gear, I go with Grenade Capacity because I use a lot of grenades with this build.  If I didn't have that gear at a high level, I might consider something like the Multicapacitor for slightly more survivability.

For the Weapon Amp, if you want to make the most of this build (on Gold), you're probably going to have to use a Strength Enhancer III.  Several of the combos I am going to describe below fall apart without this extra bonus.  Some enemies that only require 1 melee will require 2 instead.

For the Armor Module, you probably want to use a Power Amplifier I or higher.  Enemies with 2025 health will be just short of dying from a Biotic Charge and heavy melee without it (assuming Power Synergy and Martial Artist aren't active yet).

For ammo, I don't have any strong opinions except I would stay away from the three new ammo types (Drill, Phasic, and Explosive).  If you feel like setting up tech combos, then Incendiary, Cryo, or Disruptor are all good.  I've been using Cryo for the extra security of keeping targets immobilized, and because it pairs perfectly with the Acolyte, as one shot = frozen enemy.  You could also go with AP or Warp if you feel like bumping the damage on your secondary weapon for bosses.  Or you could use nothing at all.

## ***GAMEPLAY***

I'm sure this will come as a shock, but the key to playing this class is staying alive.  Fortunately, you have a lot of tools at your disposal to help with this, as all three of your powers stagger / immobilize your enemies.

Let's focus on the non-boss enemies, as that is what this build is primarily designed to deal with.  The table below outlines some common scenarios and strategies / combos you might use to kill them.

Scenario|Strategy / Combo|Enemies Killed|Notes
:---|:--:|:--:|:---
Lone unshielded enemy with health|Biotic Charge -&gt; Heavy Melee|All except Possessed Collectors|If Martial Artist is active, you do not need the Strength Enhancer or Power Amplifier equipment for this to work

That's a lot of information, but knowing your combos can be the difference between life and death.  Most likely, things are going to be moving too fast when you're playing this class to always pull off these moves.  A lot of times you are just improvising, and given that teammates may also be doing damage to these targets, some of these combinations may be overkill.

In terms of staying alive, I recommend staying close to teammates for when you (inevitably) get killed.  Try to make sure your shield gate is always up before engaging enemies.  And finally, be extra attentive to your flanks because that's almost always what brings you down.

## ***SUMMARY***

In case it's not obvious, this build has a high degree of difficulty.  I'd recommend taking it out at lower difficulties because it takes awhile to get a feel for it (especially if you've been running around with tanky characters).  I was terrible my first couple of matches, but eventually I figured it out and was scoring on par with many of my other mid-tier builds (although I was still dying more often).

If you're a bit of a masochist, this is definitely the build for you.  And, how many of you are currently sitting on unspecced Drell Vanguards?  Give this a shot, you won't regret it (maybe?).

Feel free to five advice/suggestions.

You're going to play this very aggressively. Basically running around smashing the shit out of everything. This works best if you have another biotic priming/detonating BE's, as you can ruin anything's day about twice as fast. Not to mention more AoE. Target bosses and be on a slope when possible, sync kills are the bane of this build. That's pretty much the strategy, if necessary you can play more defensively by falling back and hitting enemies through walls.

Singularity: 4 here. Do whatever you want. You'll us this on advancing husks etc. To give yourself some room to breathe. Occasionally you'll use this to prime a BE, but it's usually best to spam smash.

Smash: This is your key power, 6 here. Spec it out for damage and armour damage. This power will be used for knocking the shit out of any boss that looks at you funny. With someone else priming BE's for you it becomes even more devastating. When mooks get too close for comfort use smash to send them sky high.

Lash: 6 here as well, bottom row. When you've sent a mook flying with smash, there is nothing as satisfying as using lash to set off a BE and start up a space program. Lash will also be used to set off BE's on enemies floating from singularity. It can also be used to deal with an enemy that gets too close to you that you have to hit faster than smash's delay. Bringing problematic mooks closer to smash and whatnot can also be effective.

Passives: 4 here, power damage. Pretty simple reasoning there.

Fitness: 6 here. Why not passives you ask? You're going to be up in the face of some of the nastiest enemies there are, you need as much durability as you can get. 

Weapon: Acolyte. Because duh. Strip the shields of bosses so you can use smash to it's fullest potential. Extended mags and high-cal barrel. Also because duh.

Equipment: Shield Booster or Power Cells. The 825 barrier of this class won't cut it when you're getting up close and personal with baddies. For ammo I'm unsure as I don't know what works with the acolyte. Pistol Rail Amp for weapon bonus if you feel you need it.

There are various bugs, glitches, and netcode issues that are present throughout the game but most people don't know about them. There are also non-bug related conventions that many don't know about (the uselessness of AP mods on projectile weapons for one).



Some bugs that come to mind:

- Broken Rage power on Krogan Vanguard

- Paladin tech bursts centered on player

- SMG ULM still not working (caveat: unless player also equips a pistol with ULM)

- Energy Drain rank 6 armor boost evolution only works if player is hosting



Some general game mechanics and netcode issues people should know about:

- AP mods not applicable to projectile weapons (GPS, Falcon, etc)

- Vanguard non-host glitch (most people know about this by now)

- Falcon/Striker non-host firing issue



Proposal:

Assuming there isn't already a resource like this out there already (I've been searching for a while but couldn't find anything current) I'd like to propose we set up a public Google doc listing any of the bugs and issues, and update it as needed if things get patched or new ones spring up as Bioware adds content. We could add it to the sidebar here and maybe post it to BSN to get the word out to more people. 


The hope is that it will inform people of what power evolutions aren't working and therefore pointless to choose and other persistent bugs. I still cringe seeing a powers-based classes with an SMG using ULM join the lobby or someone using a GPS with an AP mod. And we could also test and confirm certain issues. For example, when the Ex-Cerberus came out, everyone thought that Fitness was broken on them, but it eventually came to light that it worked fine. Things like this could be addressed more quickly (hopefully) and used as a reference for anyone still wondering if something is working or not.


This is, of course, assuming there isn't already an updated listing somewhere on the web. I couldn't find anything relevant and comprehensive, so I thought this might be helpful for everyone (myself included).


**EDIT**

I'll try to put together a Google doc in the next day or so with everything I know of and everything listed below, categorized in a way that will hopefully be easy to read. If you know of any other bugs, glitches, etc list them below and I'll add accordingly. 

Maybe once we have a decent amount of data compiled, we can get the doc stickied to the sidebar.

[Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10tRpDuIRrraT6dwSsOQ_ARtncnRnlfC2_ZCxYikFPUk/edit)

I created a Google Doc with all the stuff that came to mind. I'm sure there are more that I'm forgetting at the moment, and there are some things that I need confirmation on. 

If anyone has any input or suggestions, that'd be great.

1339528023.0,27,self.MECoOp,uyef2,Cerberus Jedi: my cerberus vanguard build and playstyle,32,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/uyef2/cerberus_jedi_my_cerberus_vanguard_build_and/,"Out of all the Rebellion characters, the ex-Cerberus ones were the only ones that looked at all appealing to me. I've never much liked male quarians or vorcha in the single-player part of the game, and I tend to be somewhat biased about playing my favorite races/classes that I grew to like in the single player. Sentinels, infiltrators, turians, asari, geth, and the like. That's getting off topic though. Point is, after looking briefly at both Phoenix characters, it became pretty clear to me that since the only difference between them is singularity and charge, there was no reason to ever pick the adept over the vanguard.

After a couple games messing around with the vanguard's powers, I came to a conclusion and noticed a lot of problems I had with the class: one, it really struggles trying to use its powers to beat armored enemies, and two, that I really, really, hated smash. I don't care how good the perks you get from using smash are, the frame data on that move made it unusable for me. It has massive startup time, massive recovery time, limited range, no invincibility, and triggers a cooldown. Using this move out in the open on higher difficulties is a death wish. I see people saying it's most effective when used through walls, and this sort of highlights how gimmicky and unwieldy of a move it is. I have something of a fighting game background as well as RPGs, and something you learn from fighting games is that it doesn't matter if one of your character's moves takes off half a lifebar on its own, if it's so slow that you can't safely or reliably hit someone with it without it whiffing or getting punished, it's still a bad move no matter how much damage it does, and will likely be completely ignored by top players in favor of more utilitarian moves with better frame data. Now this tends not to be a big deal in most traditional RPGs, but we have to remember that ME3 multiplayer really isn't an RPG at all. It's a third-person action game with some light RPG elements in terms of character building.

So I started looking at his heavy melee move, and saw how fast it was in comparison. Very little startup and virtually no recovery coupled with a large area of effect with no limit on how many targets it could hit made this far more appealing to me than smash. So I decided that I would try to eliminate the aspects of the class I didn't like and try to make the things I did like about it as powerful as possible. And when I designed the build, everything fell into place and I endedup with one of the most unique, fun playstyles I've used in this game so far. [Check it.](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#54PAPOK[9@0)

The class I ended up with didn't miss smash at all. In fact, smash would only slow him down/get him killed. It took me a couple games to decide what the perfect weapon would be, but as soon as I tried out the reegar carbine, I knew I had a keeper. With a reegar X with blade attachment and shredder and the alliance training weight perks, you're sitting at 185% cooldown bonus. I played a bunch of games with it on silver and really, really liked how playing it felt; the playstyle felt much more unique than pretty much any other class I had played, being equally dependent on biotics, melee, and weapons instead of just specializing in one. After a while, I realized what I had done: I had created a Mass Effect jedi.

So now, I'm going to break the class down for you in jedi terms: **lash is your force pull.** It's your only ranged attack, but it's really the only one you need. The fact that it can penetrate shields and barriers makes it an excellent move. Spam it at enemies at the beginning of rounds. You have 2 options you can go for with this. You can either lash, then charge to make your own biotic detonation, or lash to pull them close and finish off with a heavy melee to activate your fitness perks and go into hyper mode. Generally it's a good idea to detonate shielded enemies since you likely won't be able to pull them into melee range and try to yank unshielded enemies directly at you and heavy melee them as they're flying by. Once you start getting into the thick of battle, you won't use lash much since you need to keep your shields up, but it's a great round starter and also good for hack missions.

Now for the big 3: **Your charge is your force jump. Your dual whips from heavy melee are your lightsabers. Your reegar is your force lightning.** The bulk of your time spent in rounds will be up close and personal with the enemy. Charge, heavy melee, then force lightning with your reegar while mashing on your charge key. It's a cycle that's sustainable against groups of regular enemies even on gold. It can be helpful to try and lash a lone enemy at you to kill with melee before you go Mace Windu on all the bitches though, that way you'll already have boosted melee damage when you charge into a group and it will be easier to continue to rack up the melee kills and refresh your bonus. Enemies on gold won't all die in one melee or anything, but that's not the point. This is a sustainable cycle. Your area charge staggers, your heavy melee is so fast that it's finished almost exactly as the stagger ends, and your reegar can often re-stagger in the 1-2 seconds it takes your charge to finish cooling down. The reegar does massive damage as well and can actually be finishing off one or two enemies in the group on the first cycle.

So yeah, that's pretty much the strategy for all regular enemies of any enemy type. You can be fairly braindead and just charge, lightsaber, force lightning over and over, even on gold. The class is also an excellent phantom-slayer, but you have to be a little more careful about it. You can still charge them and stagger, but do not melee after. You'll open yourself up for an instakill. Instead, charge, roll backwards, and then immediately empty a reegar clip into them. This tends to either make them stagger again, swing their sword at you, or do a ninja flip. Hit them with a lash so long as you're not taking fire from other sources and your shields are still up, they wont be able to go into block stance because they're no longer in neutral stance and can't cancel into block from their other animations. You can then detonate them with a charge to knock them down and deliver the coup de grace with a heavy melee. If the melee doesn't quite finish them, either do it again, charge them again, or just spray them with more force lightning. Few classes can fight phantoms up close like the cerberus jedi can, and none can do it with as much style.

* Leave It In The Rant Threads. **DO NOT USE THESE THREADS TO PASS JUDGEMENT OUTSIDE OF MECoOP OR THE THREADS STOP!** These threads are being made to relieve some of the clutter on the main page and are a privilege we are allowing. These can be fun and please don't abuse them.

* Keep It In The Rant Thread. **NO STARTING THREADS COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING FOR THE SAKE OF RANTING!** These threads are made for that. There are acceptable rant based threads. Creating one with the title ""Anyone else tired of those stupid Krogan Mudertrains blocking your shot?"" with comments and content doing nothing but bashing them and making fun of them are no longer aloud. Acceptable threads are titled and contain content such as ""Can we get the Krogan Vanguards to learn to move instead of blocking a shot?"" and constructive tips, ideas, comments, and strategies to help said Krogan.

* Have Fun. **YOU WILL OR I WILL MAKE YOU!** No, really. These threads can be fun and stress relieving. Come in these threads with a few things in mind: *You will get trolled, you will get made fun of, you will yell, caps lock will be used, grammar will not be correct, tempers will flair, and things will be said that you may regret when you sober up.*

Each thread will be up on the sidebar or on the top of the page under/beside/above the announcement for exactly a week. A new thread will then replace it every Monday.

Single player works fine. This occurs on any network I attempt to get on from, in different cities even. I've uninstalled the game, uninstalled origin, reinstalled both, nothing.

Here's a recent gold run that I did in a public group. Only a couple deaths, mostly in the extraction phase but we still full extracted. I used no rockets for this run.

    -

Fair warning, there is a steep learning curve that comes with this build. I was confined to Silver for a while until I got a feel for dodging back around corners and learning just how little damage I could take. This build is not for everyone. While learning you are going to die. A lot. More than a level 1 vanguard in gold. No I'm not kidding.

I have, however, been constantly topping damage in gold runs, mostly Geth farming on Firebase White. And I've stopped dying constantly, usually only dying once or twice per run at most.

    -

**The Build:**
6/6/6/0/6



**Tactical Cloak:** Derp. Going to need it to get into melee range. Points go into 40% damage, 50% melee, and extra power when cloaked (which is needed for proxy mines, see below).

**Proxy Mine:** Used to stagger opponents and to apply damage buff.
Points go into 50% Impact Radius, Increased damage to targets by 20%, and increased damage by 50%.

**Hunter Mode:** This is why you're a glass cannon. While losing half your shields is not ideal, the added speed and damage more than make up for it. Points go into 20% Recharge Speed, 15% Power Damage and 10% Bonus Damage.

**Networked AI:** Skip it. Damage modifiers don't apply an additional buff to the cloak bonus.

**Advanced Hardware:** Fairly self explanatory. Grab all the melee damage modifiers. No point in getting shield upgrades if you're losing half of them to Hunter Mode.

**Weapons:** I recently went back to the Geth Plasma Shotgun for a couple reasons. You can get a full charge on the shotgun and then cloak with a full charge ready. Also you can still drop a proxy mine while staying cloaked and keeping the charge. Also while holding charge every time yuou use heavy melee the gun fires as the animation for melee begins, so it's like getting extra shots for free.

    -

**So how does it work?**

Luckily the concept behind the build is really simple. Engage hunter mode, wait for the round to start, find a couple enemies that are grouped up, cloak, drop a proxy mine at their feet and smash heavy melee till they're dead. Which for an unshielded enemy will be one hit, two for most things with shields and three for anything with armor (minus bosses). Though once you've killed something with heavy melee the bonus 75% melee damage and 30% power damage kick in, so you should be effectively one and two shorting anything on the map. And for bosses (I've mostly dealt with Geth Primes) you should be stripping away three bars of shields and two to three bars of armor per melee hit.

    -

**Tactics:**

Now this is the tricky part. Because of hunter mode you're already half down on shields. Also the Geth melee attack drains shields so it leaves you even more exposed. The idea is to get in and get out as fast as possible doing as much damage as possible. This takes a lot of practice to master. As stated above you're going to die a lot. It's ok. This is a high risk/high reward build.

The first thing you'll want to do is get inside. Being in wide open areas is dangerous as crossfire will kill you almost instantly. You want to make sure that you know where all the enemies currently active are at all times. Hunter mode helps greatly by letting you see through walls. This way you know where safe cover is at all times and where you next target is.

Choose your targets carefully. You don't want overly-large groups (more than 5) if at all possible. Single targets are, of course, the easiest to deal with, but because the Geth heavy melee is and area of effect attack and pulses this is not the most efficient way of killing everything in front of you. One is ok, three is ideal, and at most engage five.

For engaging you'll want to select a target and try to engage it in a way which allows you to get into cover quickly. At most you'll get two, maybe three pulses of the heavy melee in before they're too far away for it to affect them and you'll be dead. But those two pulses should be all you need to kill whatever it is you're fighting. So, for engaging. Cloak up, run to your target and drop a Proxy mine. This will stagger them for a brief moment which will allow you to get a good angle of attack. Once you're in a good position hold start using heavy melee. This should stagger the enemies back farther and do massive damage to them. After two pulses they'll likely be dead.

Now you dodge back to cover, regen shields, rinse and repeat. For larget bosses there's a bit more finesse to it, but it's a simple rotation. Cloak, proxy mine, 2 melee pulses, dodge to cover. Once you get back to cover the cooldown for cloak should be up, so just cloak again, rinse repeat.

**Why play a melee based Infiltrator?**

Cause it's ridiculously fun. It's sort of like playing a Human Vanguard. You get right in the middle of the action and blow everything up, except you're a Geth and therefore way cooler. Honestly The build is viable at gold levels and I'm enjoying it more than sniping. It is, however, a very high risk build. Also I haven't had much experience on gold versus Reaper or Cerberus, though I'm going to be trying those out this weekend, so I'll let you guy know how it works out (cause it's a breeze vs Geth, you just have to watch out for Turrets and learn how to engage pyros correctly).

1334268054.0,27,self.MECoOp,s6w0k,PSA To all new Geth: Avenger vs. Geth Pulse Rifle vs. Armored targets,32,5,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/s6w0k/psa_to_all_new_geth_avenger_vs_geth_pulse_rifle/,"**EDIT: April 17th - Today's multiplayer balance changes give the GPR around a 10% per-shot damage increase, which is enough for the GPR to outperform (slightly) the Avenger on armored targets, as long as you have the level 5 AP mod installed**

TL;DR - The damage bonus you get for using Geth weapons on Geth characters does not make the Geth Pulse Rifle a good weapon for Silver or Gold matches.

Since Resurgence, I've seen a lot of Gethgineers toting Geth Pulse Rifles. It's perfectly natural to want to use a Geth Assault Rifle on your Geth Engineer: I mean, you get bonuses to Geth weapons and everything!

Unfortunately, even with the bonus, the Geth Assault Rifle Still can't keep up with an Avenger, at least on Silver and above.

Let's look at the numbers, assuming every +weapon damage power available to a Geth Engineer, and a level V AR Extended Barrel.

* Avenger X Burst DPS: 402
* GPR X Burst DPS: 411
* GPR X Burst DPS w/ Geth Bonus: 452

It looks like a no brainer, right? (We'll ignore sustained DPS, where the GPR is already behind quite a bit due to the longer reload time) However, the picture changes quite a bit when you go up in difficulty and throw armor into the mix.

If you didn't know, armored targets get a flat damage reduction

* Bronze: 15 points
* Silver: 30 points
* Gold: 50 points

Adjusted for powers and mods like before, the GPR has a base damage of 50.01. This means that you're hitting armored targets for the following damage:

* Bronze: 35
* Silver: 20
* Gold: 5 (there is a minimum damage per shot of 5)

Because the GPR is low damage per shot, but with a high RoF, it suffers on silver and gold much the same way SMGs do.

When comparing Burst DPS, you can see that vs. Armored targets, the GPR is beaten handily by the Avenger, even when factoring in the 10% geth damage boost. Values will be Avenger/GPR

* Bronze: 568/525
* Silver: 443/300
* Gold: 276/75

If you add an AP mod to your rifle, the discrepancy isn't quite as dire, but the Avenger is still better in Silver and Gold

* Bronze: 649/671
* Silver: 605/593
* Gold: 547/488

I haven't factored in ammo powers, because you'll eventually run out of AP ammo, and disruptor ammo has better synergy with overload, anyhow.

Also, this is Burst DPS - Sustained fire lowers the DPS of the GPR more so than the Avenger.",,False,self,t5_2tkk1,True,,Alliance,True,t3_s6w0k,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/s6w0k/psa_to_all_new_geth_avenger_vs_geth_pulse_rifle/,

My FIRST suggestion is to do as follows, log into your router.
Make sure that you have the correct ports forwarded for your console and network (live,psn etc. will list below) and for EA servers.

If you don't know how to do this, visit www.portforward.com, using the guides, choose your router model, and you will see a list of games/services etc to choose from, and follow the easy instructions to get your network connecting flawlessly.

Since doing so about 3 weeks ago,  I have yet to drop from a game, lose EA server connection, and VERY VERY rarely experience lag issues. 

XBOX LIVE PORTS ( 88, 3074 for live, and 53 for EA servers)
PSN PORTS ( 5223, and 3478-3479, 53 is worth a shot here too)
PC Ports (3659 and 6000)

I couldn't *not* pick this one. It was just too funny reading it.

&gt;**BIOTICS**

&gt;They're ~~magical~~ sciencical (shut up) energy blobs made from ~~magic~~ eezo exposure in utero, and ~~head power~~ electric signals from your brain; these are amplified by ~~the power of rock!~~ a Biotic Implant.

&gt;Despite this, I cannot for the life of me understand how Dark Channel works. Wait, bad phrasing. I know how it works! Wait! Wait! Don't close the tab just yet!

&gt;**DARKLY ~~DREAMING~~ CHANNELING ~~DEXTER~~ BIOTICS**

&gt;Dark Channel is a biotic power available to the...

&gt;- Asari Huntress

&gt;- Awakened Collector

&gt;- N7 Fury

&gt;Now in alphabetical order!

&gt;So, this power's pretty handy. It's like an STD, if you could get STDs by standing nearby people who had an STD (remember how we all used to think that was how... Eh, never mind), and those STDs created fields of energy that surrounded you and slowly compressed your body like a t-shirt you're trying to fit inside a gift box if the gift box were a little bit smaller than the one you should have bought? That's Dark Channel. It's an STD-shirt. WAIT LEMME TRY THAT AGAI-

&gt;**HOW TO USE IT!**

&gt;*-N.* Damn it! Okay, this one's easy. Dark Channel is a hitscan biotic (which is pretty rare); this means if you target an enemy and press whatever button you have mapped to the skill, they'll get hit by it as soon as your character pulls off the animation. There are no projectiles to curve around corners like in Wanted (the comic book); just good 'ol fashioned point-and-shoot action.

&gt;What's great about Dark Channel is how it affects the enemy: no matter what defenses they have (health, armor, shields, barriers), it'll drain that meter quickly and painfully. It also primes biotic explosions, which which makes it very dangerous for whoever's coated in that wonderful, purple cloud of t-shirt-into-gift-box pain. There's no impact damage, but it'll deal a consistent amount of damage over the course of 30 seconds (initially). Plus, if the targeted enemy dies, it'll pass on to another foe (the timer on the duration will continue to tick down, however).

&gt;Thing about the ""infectious"" properties of DC: it only works if an enemy is within 8 meters of the most recent victim of the attack. If nobody's close, poof. Dark Channel disappears, and you have to recast it. Thankfully, you've probably had enough time to recharge since you last cast it.

&gt;Now, about all these metaphors. We should probably stop using them. They may be starting to detract from the article.

&gt;**PROS! ALSO, IGNORE THE PREVIOUS TWO COMPLETE SENTENCES!**

&gt;- Biotic Primer

&gt;- Passes on to nearest ""healthy"" enemy when previous victim dies

&gt;- Primes new victim, even if old victim died through a BE

&gt;- Hitscan

&gt;- Moderate cooldown means not too much time will pass before casting a detonator

&gt;- Power Damage increases DOT

&gt;Stop working against me, capitalized, bolded text! You can't tell the readers what to think!

&gt;**CONS!**

&gt;- Unconventional biotic that doesn't require constant casting for use; may confuse newcomers

&gt;- Moderate cooldown means lighter weapons might be needed

&gt;- Not really helpful if you don't put the focus on DOT

&gt;**HOW YOU SHOULD USE IT!**

&gt;When enemies cluster together, it'd be a good time to unleash a Dark Channel and go to town with whatever powers your class supplies you with. You'll hear a distinct noise to alert you to when the power shifts to a new target (if you're nearby, that is). Remain alert of who is being affected by the attack, and you should be able to keep the power up for the majority of its duration, tossing out detonators while it lasts.

&gt;Now, about these obnoxious capital letters. I have a thing or two to say to you!

First, let's look at what's good about the Scanner in isolation, without comparing it to other gears. It offers the following benefits:
&gt;
&gt;* Increased situational awareness: As you move around the map, you are rarely going to be surprised by enemies hiding around corners or behind cover. This helps immensely for positioning yourself strategically and staying alive.
&gt;
&gt;* Wall Hax: With enough AP capability, you will be able to shoot many enemies through walls and avoid direct confrontation altogether. The Scanner enables you to see them so you know where to aim.
&gt;
&gt;* Increased Enemy Visibility: You can now see through smoke and see cloaked enemies like Hunters or Phantoms.
&gt;
&gt;Of course, everyone knows these benefits. What I don't think as many people realize is how much more value these benefits have when compared to most other gears in the game. For the gears that offer damage bonuses, the effective damage bonus is often much less than the reported percentage boost. Let's look at some examples:
&gt;
&gt;[Asari Huntress w/ Commando Package V and Warp IV:](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/AsariHuntress/PLQID/Paladin10AI5BK5//PistolRailAmp3//CommandoPackage5/) Against primed enemies, the Commando Package yields an effective bonus of 4% to the pistol damage (64 damage from gear out of 1630 total) because of all the other weapons bonuses that have been layered in. For powers, assuming they are being fired from cloak, the power damage bonus from the Commando Package is only 4%.
&gt;
&gt;[Quarian Female Engineer w/ Pistol Amp V and no equipment:](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Engineer/Quarian/AKRPR/Paladin10AI5BK5////PistolAmp5/) Even on a class / build that has very little weapons focus, the Pistol Amp is not nearly as effective as you'd think. It only gives a 9% effective bonus compared to the reported 15%. If you use any equipment / ammo, the effective bonus will become even lower.
&gt;
&gt;Those are two extreme cases, but even in the best case scenario for the damage gear (the QFE w/ no equipment), the effective bonus isn't that great. In a rough 'best case' scenario for using damage bonus gear, it's still only about 60% as effective as reported, and for a rough 'worst case' scenario, it's only 30% as effective. Even if you can squeeze out an effective 10% bonus from a damage gear, is that small boost worth more than all the benefits of the Geth Scanner?
&gt;
&gt;That said, there are certain builds that do rely on damage gear to get past certain critical thresholds. Some sniper builds may be sensitive to damage thresholds due to shield-gate, and likewise, some shield-stripping powers may need a little extra boost to make sure you can strip, for instance, a Phantom's shield in a single try. But, overall, I see very little benefit overall to using these gears compared to the benefits afforded by the Geth Scanner.
&gt;
&gt;At this point, the only gears I find myself using consistently are the Geth Scanner, Grenade Capacity, Stronghold Package, and Armored Compartments. There are cases where I'll use others, but those four now make up more than 90% of my Gear usage.
&gt;
&gt;I will acknowledge that at low levels the Geth Scanner is less useful. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the range starts at only 10m, which isn't that great. But it levels up quickly - even by level II, I think it's a good option, especially if your other Gear isn't high level either.
&gt;


I've only recently gotten this gear, but I do agree that it has a lot of great potential!

However, now that things are fixed we have decided that we should relax these restrictions in order to mitigate this subreddit's stagnation. That is not to say we want to break away from what /r/MECoOp is at its heart. We simply feel it is our job to keep this place going for as long as possible, and one of the best ways of doing this is by supporting user-created content.

1365793296.0,25,self.MECoOp,1c8290,The way of the reload cancel.,31,6,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1c8290/the_way_of_the_reload_cancel/,"When you're using weapons with a small clip, like the claymore and the black widow, reload cancels can be very helpful. This post will show a couple of ways to cancel the reload animation.

A reload cancel is when you cancel out the reload animation. When you reload a weapon, the clip of the weapon will be filled again before the animation is finished. When you reload cancel, the animation ends when your clip is full again.

There are multiple ways to reload cancel. The following ones are mostly well-known, but not always practical.

- Sprinting or evading whike the reload animation plays.
- Using a power when the reload animation plays.
- using melee when the reload animation plays

There are some much better ways to reload cancel though:

- When your powers are cooling down and you can see the cooldown icon, pressing a button to use a power will cancel the reload animation. This also counts for an empty grenade slot.
- If the class you are playing as cannot evade, pressing the evade button while reloading will result in a reload cancel. 
- After using a power like marksman, tactical cloak or adrenaline rush (without bonus power evolutions), pressing one of the power buttons can cancel your reload. 
- (PC only) When in the reload animation, pressing the medigel key will cancel the animation.

Reload cancels are very useful when using low-clip weapons. But even weapons with a short reload can be canceled out, although the results are not as good. Try using these ways to reload cancel and see if they're useful!

1363393929.0,25,self.MECoOp,1adtdh,"Judge, Jury, and Executioner (Executioner Pistol Discussion)",30,5,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1adtdh/judge_jury_and_executioner_executioner_pistol/,"**Introduction**

Now this won't be as long as the Venom Discussion, but I think that the semi-uniqueness deserves a bit of discussion. Fortunately it is a rare card, so that means plenty of people will have access to it.

Basically a pocket Widow, the Executioner pistol is one of the many heavy-hitting pistols available for us to use. While it has individually more powerful shots (roughly twice that of a comparable Scorpion), it also has one critical flaw: one shot per clip. So if you miss, that's a problem. However if there is a way to do a second attack after a shot, either by another Executioner shot or power, this weakness is mostly negated.

**Stats**

In the [weapons spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgoNSTctMEekdHIwa081S0FBVS1ZZzdWeXRnbGRDYnc#gid=8), the Executioner occupies cells I78 to I142. Of particular note:

*Similarities to the Carnifex*- The Executioner and Carnifex share the same weight, reload time, and accuracy.

*Damage*- At X, the Executioner delivers 981.1 points of damage per shot. This means that on Gold/Plat, you won't be able to one shot most enemies like you can with the Javelin and Widow.

*Single shot*- Because it is a single shot gun, the Executioner's sustained DPS suffers. If you are going to use it for bosses, I suggest using the Paladin, Scorpion, or AP Talon instead.

*Penetration*- Like the Widow and Crusader, the Executioner has 50cm of penetrative power right off the bat. This means that you can pierce Guardian shields and thin cover without the need of extra mods or ammo.

**Mods and Ammo**

*Magazine Capacity*- Unless you are using an N7 Destroyer with DM, this mod does nothing but turn it black. Having a two shot Executioner is interesting though, so it might be worth it in that case.

*High-Caliber Barrel, Heavy Barrel, Cranial Trauma System*- Damage mods are an excellent choice for this gun. Recall that because this weapon came in a DLC that the Heavy Barrel adds weight to the gun. You should also try and get headshots when possible, but it's understandable if you can't get them because of its accuracy out of cover.

*Melee Stunner, Power Amplifier*- Given how few mods are quite effective on the Executioner, nothing is wrong with taking these if this gun is your main weapon as it augments character power, but not the gun itself per se.

*Pistol ULM, Piercing Mod*- These two mods are situational to use. Sometimes you want to have a lighter pistol or a pistol with more penetration power. Use these if you want the pistol to be individually better to use.

*Scope*- I'm not a fan of Pistol Scopes but if you feel that the scope makes you a better shot, put it on. Every shot counts with the Executioner.

*Ammo*- A matter of personal opinion, but I see Disruptor Ammo as the best choice. You get anti-shield power, stunning ability to ease the second shot, and the ability to prime for a Tech Burst. Alternatives include Incendiary Ammo for the DoT and Fire Explosion, Phasic Ammo for pure anti-shield ability, and Warp for being just a high damaging ammo type.

**Tips and Tricks**

*Aim true*- Given that it is a single shot weapon, don't miss. If that means taking an extra second to aim, then do so. Every miss hurts you and there's no rush to shoot, so there's no reason to make sure you hit. On that note, keep in mind that Executioner goes from mildly accurate to laser accurate when going into cover.

*One-two punch*- Since it can't one-shot enemies at higher difficulty, I suggest compensating by combining a shot with something else. With a Human Soldier (base and N7 Destroyer), and to a lesser extend the Turian and Quarian Soldiers, you can fire two shots quite rapidly. The only issue is that you have to have decent recoil control to get the second shot off in a decent time frame. The other method I suggest is combining a shot with a power. For example, consider shooting a Disruptor Ammo shot at a mook and following it up with a Throw. You'll get rid of the shields with the shot and the Throw will both ragdoll the mook and detonate a Tech Burst. Other good powers to combine with the Executioner include Warp (with Incendiary Ammo), Ballistic Blades, and Concussive Shot.

*SNARL*- More fun than anything else, but the Executioner has a unique drawing sound. This includes a Vorcha snarl at the end of it.

**Conclusion**

This isn't a 'one shot, one kill' weapon like the single shot sniper rifles, but it can be a 'one combo, one kill' weapon. Not the strongest pistol in a player's armory, but the Executioner fills its role nicely as a high-risk, high reward hand cannon.

About the spitfire:

&gt;We will be buffing the Spitfire next week, but it definitely isn't as bad as some people in this thread believe.   

Spitfire details:

&gt;Just so there are no surprises this time, we are looking at a raw 10% damage bonus to the Spitfire. The sustained DPS on the weapon is in a pretty good spot right now but is probably a little low for the weapon's weight and other penalties. The armor damage is lower than other ultra rare ARs but the shield and barrier damage is way higher along with huge ammo reserves, so we feel it just needs a slight bump.

Talon and AIU (+other stuff):

&gt;We have some significant changes planned for the Talon kit, some buffs for a couple other weapons and powers, and a nerf to Repair Matrix. 

Ascension mode:

&gt;No plans to change Ascension Mode at this time. For that mode, we never intended for it to be a mode you keep on all the time and saw it more as a situational ability for some temporary extra offensive potential.""

1361994699.0,28,self.MECoOp,19cgxi,Walk for Your Lives (Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Juggy) [build],36,8,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19cgxi/walk_for_your_lives_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/,"[Build Link](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Soldier/GethJuggernaut/AORNQ/Lancer10AF5AD5/CollectorSR10AS5BJ5/TargetingVI3/CyclonicModulator4/JuggernautShield5/)

As everyone should be aware, Reckoning has brought some **very** interesting characters into the mix.  Thus far, my personal favorite has been the Geth Juggernaut.  So lemme lay it on the line and explain why you should love this class as well.

**The Build**

* *Siege Pulse* **Radius &gt; Damage Protection &gt; Number of Shots**:  For those that have not played the Juggernaut yet, siege pulse operates similarly to biotic orbs.  The initial cast summons a preset number of ""pulses"" which can then be used at any moment regardless of your cooldown timer.  Siege Pulse is fantastic for minor crowd control, getting those bastard mooks off your ass, and reload cancelling.  Especially with the weapons I like to roll out on this bad boy.

* *Hex Shield*:  Skip this personally.  In my experience it has just done more harm than good.  Neither you nor your teammates can shoot through with bullet penetration and frankly it seems to just cause me more trouble than anything else.

* *Geth Turret* **Shield Restore &gt; Restore Range &gt; Restore Frequency**:  This turret WILL NOT be used for DPS!  It exists to distract some baddies and, most importantly, to refill your shields for that extra little boost.

* *Geth Juggernaut* **Weapon Damage &gt; Stability &amp; Ammo &gt; Weapon Damage**:  We're not concerned with cool down or power damage here.  We're here to roll out the red carpet of hurt with some serious sustained fire.

* *Hardened Platform* **Durability &gt; Shield Recharge &gt; Squad Command**:  This can go more towards personal preference.  Personally, I like to be as absolutely tanky as possible and thus opt for durability over melee damage in the rank 4 evolution.  That's your call.  

**The Armaments**

Thus far I've had great success and pleasure rolling with the Lancer (armor piercing and magazine size) and CSR (I've been piercing and high velocity barrel).  Who gives a shit about cool down times?  You don't, that's who.  Not with all of your sexy shields in all their glory.

What about equipment?  Personally I enjoy using the Juggernaut Shield along with some nice drill rounds and (if you really want to go bawls oot) a cyclonic modulator.  This is something else that's up to personal preference.

**The Style**

You ever tank before?  Nah.  You haven't.  At least you haven't tanked until you tank as a Geth Juggernaut.  You haven't felt the aggro till you've aggro'd as a Geth Juggernaut.  Your job is to lumber your fine ass in there, draw all the fire you could possibly want and then make it very clear that you don't give a single fuck bout none dat noise.  You will melee everything in sight, restore your shields, shoot at some more stuff, and then heavy melee everything in sight again.  Lather, Rinse, Repeat. Juggy here can solo Silver like it ain't nothing.  It turns it into a class A joke.  Gold soloing I can't evaluate but when you are in a team, Mr. Juggy here fits right in.  This is Gold.  On easy mode. Come on, bros. Fight me.  Yeah that's what I thought.  You won't swing.

As a side note, this is my first build post so I'm TOTALLY open to criticism.

EDIT:  After deliberation and some tweaks, I've come to the conclusion that the best weapons for this class (in my humble opinion) are the Lancer X and CSR X.

1358081721.0,25,self.MECoOp,16hmyk,ME3 Co-op College Races 107: Volus,28,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/16hmyk/me3_coop_college_races_107_volus/,"**Overview**

The addition and application of the Volus race has been quite controversial. They have largely been written off as pure support classes, while others hopelessly try to turn them into little death machines.

Base Health and Shields: 150/500

**Abilities**

*Volus Training*

All Volus have 30% Shield Boost in Evolution 4 of their passive instead of the 20% headshot bonus. This deters many from trying to turn a Volus into a pure weapon platform, but into a caster. Evolution 5 in the Volus passive is a 20% weight bonus to all weapons. This is a very nice bonus since they have the poorest weight capacity bonus in the game. 

*Melee*

The Volus melee had two very useful features.

*The light melee acts as a tactical cloak of the sort. Although it lacks the bonuses of the Infiltrator Cloak, it suffers no cooldown and can not be broken until it's 5s timer is completed or it is canceled. Along with the Infiltrator Cloak, you will not be able to complete ""Escorts"" or ""Carrying the Object"" operations unless you decloak.

*The heavy melee acts as a shell, granting temporary invincibility, as well as a pulsing AoE attack. More information can be found [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/143jkv/volus_meleeshield_boost_mechanics/) on it's mechanics.

*Biotic Orbs*

&gt;Summon 3 orbs to float around you. Use it again to launch an orb at a target. Each orb increases your recharge speed by 10%. Highly effective against armor and barriers.

Biotic Orbs act as a workaround to the Volus poor weight capacity. The bonus applies as such

base value of a power

/

1 + cooldown bonus + recharge bonuses + Biotic Orbs

Evolution 4 in orbs offer an option to increase recharge by an additional 5% per Orb, and Evolution 6 offers an additional orb which get the recharge bonus (it caps at +.6 = .15 bonus per orb x 4 orbs).

Evolution 5 expose evolution is what makes Biotic Orbs a great team asset. If the Volus is willing and capable, it can provide a 45% debuff for 6s, which is higher than any other power in the game. It comes with the cost of a significant cooldown when players choose to recast the Orbs later.

*Recon Mine*

&gt;Launch a mine that sticks to the first surface out touches and arms after a brief delay [3s]. The mine scans the area for enemies to provide a tactical overlay, and can be detonated at any time [after the 3s delay] to deal massive damage to nearby targets. One one mine can be active at a time.

Recon Mines is easily one of the most useful powers in the game. Not only does it work as a ""team-Tactical Scan"" with it's wall-hacking nature, but arguably the best debuffer in the hand. It's debuffing abilities apply to all scanned enemies, and with radius bonuses translates into a max of 12m. The explosion itself caps at 9m. Like [full damage] Tactical Scan it's debuff is pretty hefty, capping at 25%.

*Shield Booster*

&gt;Repair your shields and nearby allies, providing a large initial boost to shields, and then restoring field every second for 3 seconds.

This power and the lack of blatant offensive moves suggest the Volus is made for purely support. Shield Booster is a extremely useful power. It obviously replenishes shields, but can go on to promote damage reduction in Evolution 6, shortening the shield recharge delay, and finally a second of invincibility when it's cast. Having this ability helps with overall survivability of not only you, but the whole team.

*Other Powers*

*Proximity Mine (exceptional debuffer and detonator)

*Stasis (trap any non-armored target in it's place. Targets will only be released if excessive.force is done to health or it times out)

*Decoy+

*Combat Drone+

*Biotic Charge+

+ - should already be acquainted with this powers by now

**Kits and ways to make then offensive**

Here's where we straddle the line of disagreement. Several will opt for pure support, while players like myself will opt for more violent build. These are just ideas to expand the Volus playstyle.

*Adept*

Stasis, Biotic Orbs, and Shield Booster

Stasis is actually the most useful power into transforming the Volus Adept into an offensive character. The simplest way would to a Stasis-headshot build, but the lack of the 20% headshot bonus is a huge deterrent.

The only way to work around this and maintain a respectable cooldown is to use the Paladin or Graal Spike Thower. The Paladin poses issues since it gets trapped in shield gate and can't one shot most shielded targets, throwing off execution without careful planning. If you go the two shot kill route the Paladin's 3 shot clip poses a slight issue. Clip capacity mod is a nice mod to use, but you'll have to drop another mod for it. Common Headshot builds involve a Scope and Cranial Trauma System/Heavy Barrel while it's still bugged, so something has to be sacrificed. Stacking bonuses which, if not planned correctly, will cause enemies to fall from Stasis and live. Ammo powers like Warp are prefect. You can one shot shields, and the warp bonus kicks in vs health (also on Phantom's barriers), but math is still necessary for the optimal setup.

If math isn't your thing then use a Spike Thrower and capitalize on the 3x headshot multiplier or go single target damage with Vulnerability in Rank 6. 

Skipping Stasis entirely and focusing on tanking your character, taking a heavier weapon, and ""running and gunning"" works as well.

Take debuffing Orbs for boss slaying.

*Engineer*

Recon Mine, Prox Mine, Shield Booster

This is a debuffing superstar. Just like classes with Biotic Orbs, he can get a 45% debuff by using both mines. Seeing that the debuff should apply to combo explosions, using Incendiary ammo is a pretty good idea on this guy. Disruptor and Warp work as well. Any hard hitting and light weapon will work will on this class. I'd suggest the Wraith if it's high enough.

*Sentinel*

Decoy, Combat Drone, Shield Booster.

The lack of a power with a lengthy cooldown opens up this guy for heavier weapons. The most successful Sentinels I've seen concentrate in misdirection. Using the Combat Drone and Decoy to sucker enemies in, while they cloak and shoot from another location. His powers are extremely support-centric, but it's possible to turn him into offensive class.

*Vanguard*

Biotic Orbs, Biotic Charge, and Shield Booster.

Biotic Orbs are actually the what sets this apart from other Vanguards. He has the quick Charge, and with the Orbs your synergy bonus is pretty much permanent. If you go power damage synergy and expose, the Orbs get the Charge bonus while debuffing, this sets up the next Charge to hit even harder. Just keep in mind the debuff is only 6s.

By support, I mean stuff such as shield regeneration (from the volus, geth turret, demolisher pylon, etc), damage absorbtion (all I can think of on this one is the justicar barrier), supplying ammo (once again the demolisher pylon) or whatever various things you guys can think of that can be counted as support. I guess this would essentially mean anything that affects your team directly. Do you think this is something that should be added?

This is more the all around awesome kind of build.*

**Build** [**N**]( http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Adept/AsariJusticar/RPQFF/Acolyte10BA5AJ5/CerberusHarrier8AE5AF5/AssaultRifleRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator4/AssaultRifleAmp5/) - [**K**](http://kalence.drupalgardens.com/me3-builder#15!1B05515!2301595!242513!GEF55)

*Biotic Bubble*

* Radius - This makes it much easier to get bosses inside the bubble.
* Enemy weakness - This is what makes the justicar good.
* Warp Effect - This allows combos between the bubble and reave. This is what makes the justicar awesome.

*Reave*

* Radius - Duh. This is what turns this ability from awful to awesome
* Damage Reduction  - This one is very debatable and mostly depends on what level your harrier is.
* Damage&amp;Duration - The utility of this one is just too good to pass up on for a little more damage. 

*Pull*

* Radius - This one is pretty obvious too. Duration does nothing, the target will be dead long before it matters.
* Expose -  Lift damage is useless, if it is lifted, the target can be considered dead anyway
* Duration&amp;combos - Obviously.

Now so far, the it's pretty clear. In the passives it gets a little more tricky.

*Asari Justicar*

* Duration&amp;Capacity. You need the extra carry weight to use the harrier.

*Fitness*

* Durability.

I also considered  6/6/6/5/3. 

The reason I decided against this is that, first of all, I’m not actually sure if the +15% power damage actually work. The patch notes say that it’s fixed, but according to peddroelmz's thread on the bsn it’s still broken (might just be out of date though). 

Second reason: Even if it works, it wouldn't really do all that much. The only power noticeably affected by this is reave and the evolution would increase the total damage of a reave on armor by a whooping …. 200 damage. That's like one harrier shot. 

I think the extra shields are more useful than that. 

*(For continuity's sake, the build in the link is exactly as I used it in the video. The equipment choices are geared towards soloing, I discuss other choices somewhere below)* 

---  
  
**Weapons**

Well I kind of made it obvious already. Harrier and acolyte.   
The sweet, sweet dps of the harrier (enhanced by the bubble) for bosses and the area of effect stagger, stun and shield-stripping of the acolyte for everything else. 

Sadly this kind of requires a level V+ Harrier to get the most out of the build. I actually debated if it was even worth to make a post on this build because well, not all that many people have that. 

Alas, I'm having way too much fun with this to stop. 

And there are several options to compensate for a lower level harrier. Pull and bubble have really short cooldowns, so they should be fine anyway, and as for reave, you can take the recharge evolution. Missing out on 10% damage reduction isn't that big of a deal. 

If you don't have a harrier, or can't deal with the cooldowns, there are two other options that do fine in my opinion.

Firstly, the poor man's harrier (or more accurately, the man with a life's harrier), the mattock. On paper this is basically the same gun as the harrier.   
Problem is that no human being can actually click 450 times per minute consistently.  If you can come close without breaking your finger, then this is the gun for you.

The other option is the hurricane. It's light-weight, and while it doesn't do the insane dps of the harrier, it comes pretty close. As you are mostly shooting at big-bads with this, the inaccuracy and the recoil isn't that big of a deal. 

Another great weapon you can use is the wraith. It's lighter than the harrier and offers similar damage output. Also, you can go 6/6/6/3/5 with it instead.   
This also applies for the hurricane.

As for weapon mods, the acolyte is pretty obvious, ultralight materials and extended barrel. None of the other mods actually do anything for this gun.

On the harrier and mattock take any combination of extended barrel, piercing mod and magazine upgrade, depending on your ammo choice.

For the hurricane I take the high velocity barrel (or extended barrel with ap ammo) and recoil system. Heat sink is fine too.

---

**Gameplay**

Because I didn't want to create the mother of all walls of texts (see how that worked out...), I actually made a pretty video for this. 

[VIDEO](http://youtu.be/wUOQbGWcmDQ)

*I’m sorry about the quality, youtube really did a number on it; it was fine before uploading.  And I really don't have the patience to reupload it, that took like five hours.* 

*There are time-links in the description so you can skip around easily and don't have to watch the entire thing.* 

The Acolyte + pull + reave combo is incredibly good and I would go so far as to say that it is the best biotic option to take out mooks. Well, after reave + cluster grenade. 

Thanks to the aoe nature of all three parts of the combo, this will also allow you to utterly annihilate groups of mooks while also doing substantial damage to any bosses nearby. 

A couple words about reave: The dps stat may seem pretty minuscule, but if you think of it differently, every reave you cast causes: 

    130*9=1170 against health
    130*1,5*9=1755 against armor
    130*2*9=2340 against barriers
    130*0,5*9=585 against shields

Now imagine you hit a spawn with two banshees and two brutes. You just did 8200 fucking damage with a single spell. Provided nobody kills anything before reave runs out of course. 

Now for the thing that turns the justicar from any class with the harrier to an awesome class with the harrier. The bubble.

The debuff from the bubble is completely multiplicative with weapon damage, power damage and ammo equipment damage. As a quick example on just how amazing multiplicative bonuses are in this game:

A *cloaked* fully decked out 4/6/6/6/4 geth infiltrator (+gear, ammo, amps) would only do 5% more damage than an *uncloaked* geth infiltrator (same setup) would if the target was in a bubble. Seriously. (If you don't believe me, math for this is in the math post somewhere below). 

Getting the boss you want to kill actually in the bubble is probably the hardest part about playing the justicar with this build though.

As you can see in the video, I'm not a fan of rushing forward to plant the bubble, it's to risky in my opinion (especially solo). I prefer to either place it in strategic places where bosses are coming through sooner or later, or ahead of the bosses so they walk into it.  

Maps aren’t all born equal for this either. On maps like giant, ghost or jade, there are awesome places to put the bubble. On the other hand London, Vancouver, rio or condor (fuck condor) are much harder because there are so many places the enemies can come from. 

Sadly the bubble has some kind of cooldown before it primes a target for detonation again. In my experience, the next reave after a detonation will not cause an explosion, but the one after will again. You can avoid this by alternating targets.  
(Especially on gold it happens quite often that two bosses are following each other closely. You can use this to your advantage here.)

For console users it might be interesting that, if you use the magazine mod for the harrier, the time it takes to empty the clip and reave's recharge will line up pretty well. This allows reload cancelling the harrier with reave. 

---

Now, everything about geth can be seen in the video, but there are couple of things with the other races I want to talk about. 

**Cerberus**

This is probably the faction the justicar is best against outside of a solo environment. 

Atlases are the easiest boss to keep in the bubble. Phantoms are pretty easy to deal with thanks to the acolyte and pull. 

A dragoon can be killed with one acolyte shot and a bubble + reave detonation.  Will usually mostly kill the other dragoons standing next to him as well.

Cerberus really doesn't have anything the justicar doesn't have an answer to. 

**Reaper**

Banshees are a bit of a pain to keep in the bubble. But thanks to the acolyte you can get rid of the barriers really quickly and hopefully you’ll be able to kill her before she starts teleporting again. 

Brutes can mess you up as well, but at least there is no issue getting them in the bubble. Just cast it where you’re standing, they’ll come find you.

Ravagers pretty much hit the one weakness of the justicar. Armored targets that don't come close to you and that you can’t engage safely at close range. Just use the harrier for them.

**Collectors**

Probably the worst faction for the justicar. But hell, it’s the worst faction for just about any class. 

As far as I can tell though, biotic explosion are still gimped against collectors, so until that is fixed, I wouldn't really recommend playing any biotic against them. 

On the plus side, reave is even more awesome against collectors because there are no shields to slow it down. 

Apart from that, collectors are quite like the reapers. Praetorians are similar to banshees, scions are similar to ravagers. Everything else dies to acolyte/pull/reave. 

---

**Class Synergy**

There isn't really much to say about this.  
Incredible mook killing skills, easy phantom slaying, dragoon detonating, a sweet aoe debuff and very solid dps against bosses. The justicar is good at everything and will do fine on any team.

There are two class combos that I want to give a special shout-out though: 

First is the Justicar with a phoenix class.   
They just work amazingly well together. A target in the bubble will take absolutely ridiculous damage from smash and the phoenix doesn't have to worry about setting up his own biotic explosions. 

Second is the Justicar and the valkyrie.  
Debuffs over debuffs. 25% damage increase from the bubble, 15% from annihilation field and 15% from warp.   
Plus all the dot effects from reave, the bubble and from annihilation field alone will wreck anything that even comes close.

Midterm season is now in full effect, so don't expect too many things in the next week or so. I do love getting orange mail in small quantities though, so don't neglect your opinion if you have one. When I see double digits in my mailbox, I typically panic.

**Introduction**

If you are familiar with Battletech fiction (you probably know it from the *MechWarrior* series of games), then you may know of the [Elemental Battle Armor](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Elemental_%28Battle_Armor%29). Designed to be used by genetically engineered super-humans, they could easily go toe-to-toe with Mechs easily thrice their size and above. Against common infantry, they wipe the floor like a diligent janitor at a well-funded hospital.

The Krogan Sentinel is not that far off from the description. The Krogan are a race whose main occupation is combat. Nearly everything they have is tailored with that in mind. On top of that, their weaponry and powers push their damage and survivability over the top. Huge health reserves, Tech Armor damage reduction, high damaging Lift Grenades, and large encumbrance capacity allow the [Krogan Sentinel to literally be a tank on foot.](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#32PDLIRI5%400FE%40%40D4C4%400%400)

Do note that build style is very similar to Interweb Ninja's [Max McTankerson](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/yxsu6/max_mctankerson_krogan_sentinel_build/), but the play-style and equipment used are quite different.

**Passives**

Gotta have them Shields and Power Damage, so the appropriate evolutions there were taken. However the rank 6 Krogan Berserker passive was not taken because I feel those three points are better put into Incinerate, which can be used on the run.

**Tech Armor**

Since everyone loves Damage Reduction and Power Damage, those evolutions were taken. Power Damage makes both Incinerate and Lift Grenades that much more useful, as both skills are quite important to this kit.

As far as usage is concerned, just turn on Tech Armor at the beginning of the game. The only time you will need to detonate it is if you (or a friend near you) are caught in a bad situation (like a Phantom is about to shish-kabob someone) and they need to be staggered NOW. Tech Armor is lovely in the sense that it will stagger everything, even bosses. Don't be off of Tech Armor too long though, as its passive bonuses are quite useful.

**Incinerate**

So it looks like someone just threw a scrambled note at me. Oh good grief, it's Curtis and he's giving me a death glare. Gonna walk away now. Still giving me the death glare. And all the note reads is **INCINERATE?**

Ok, so Incinerate has a few uses. First off, Tech Armor is always going to be on and Lift Grenades don't eat into cooldowns. This allows for ""free"" shots of Incinerate to be used, as it is not competing with Tech Armor for cooldowns most of the time.

The second main use for this power is to use it while running towards a target. Incinerate shoots a fire and forget plasma bolt, so just shoot and keep running towards a target if that is what you need to do. 

Finally, Incinerate is a detonator power for Tech Combos. This means that if you are using any of the three priming ammos (Disruptor, Cryo, Incendiary), then you can make your own Tech Explosions. Lift Grenades have a real problem with detonating, and are often overkill when they can detonate.

Incinerate is also pretty good vs armor, but that's a side benefit really. 

**Lift Grenades**

Probably my favorite (and most important, says biased me) part of the Krogan Sentinel is their Lift Grenades. They may be below average for Grenades, but they are extraordinarily powerful and have a handy 1.5x multiplier against Barriers. 

The main issue with Lift Grenades is that they don't detonate very well. The only time I have seen them detonate is when the target is biotically primed and has only Health remaining. In addition to being very specific, Lift Grenades do so much damage (2137.5 damage/grenade with Tech Armor on) over such a large radius (6.5m) that the Biotic Explosion becomes redundant. 

Still, Lift Grenades are extremely potent and are very capable at staggering enemies. I highly recommend equipping gear that increases grenade capacity due to their immense strength.

**Weaponry**

Dang, Curtis is giving me a death glare again so I'm just going to stare right back at him. I know what's on his mind. Good, looks like he's just walking away. See what you did ""popular /r/MECoOp  opinions""? Your opinions make Curtis stare at me and make me feel somewhat uncomfortable.

So, as I was going to say, don't over encumber this kit. Having a low cooldown is great because it allows for Incinerate and Tech Armor to be used fairly often, if need be. So don't equip a Javelin and Typhoon haphazardly. Try to keep the cooldown above 50% or so as a rule of thumb.

Instead, I would suggest focusing a weapon that is accurate and that you feel comfortable at all ranges. Personally, I believe the Kishock Harpoon Gun, Saber, Valkyrie (a new favorite, I might add), Graal Spike Thrower, Paladin, Crusader, and Raptor all can fit into this category. Feel free to take another weapon if you want to, but do take into account their weight so that you aren't put into an awkward spot where you really need that Tech Armor explosion but then get shish kabbobed by a sneaky Phantom.

**Conclusion**

This kit is one of those kits I rarely see, yet deserves plenty of love. Meaty, mobile, multifaceted, massive (as smakl LOVES pointing out), and mighty, the Krogan Sentinel is a great team tank. 

Do you love your Krogan Sentinel to be a tank? Well, I can't know if you just hold your opinion to yourself. There's a convenient comment section below that can rectify that. I suggest you do that, but more importantly have fun when playing this kit. An angry tank is typically a dead tank.

Higher rate of fire than the the Vindicator.  Damage is somewhat higher than the Vindicator, somewhat lower than the Argus.  Plenty of reserve ammo even without the Magazine Upgrade. 
The main issue is the weight.  Though it has better accuracy and fire rate than the Argus, it still weighs about as much.

1339184955.0,26,self.MECoOp,us29p,ME3 stats: How many packs/credits/hours does it take to collect all the rare weapons up to level 10,31,5,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/us29p/me3_stats_how_many_packscreditshours_does_it_take/,"Just did some simple math to answer the question:

Just how many packs do I need to buy in order to get level 10 on all the rare weapons?

Summary:

- It takes about 170 premium spectre packs to complete all rare weapons

- which equates to 16.8 million credits

- which is about 240 gold matches

- or 120 hours of gameplay at 30 minutes per game

Assumption:

With 16 weapons and 18 characters available as rare items in the spectre packs, the chance of getting the weapon you want is 1/34.  Statistically, it'll take you an average of 340 tries to end up collecting all weapons to level 10.  If you're lucky and able to collect some weapons to max level earlier than others, you can potentially boost your tries down to 320 tries or less.  340 sounds like I just multiplied 34 by 10, but that number actually came from the assumption that character cards never max out, and the available cards drop by 1 when you maxes out a weapon.  Just to confirm, I even wrote a program to simulate opening of PSP until everything's level 10.



Of course, there are countless variables including your skill level, learning curve, number of mission failures, equipment pack purchases and luck, and the number of rares exist before the expansion packs.  But it kind of give an overall feel of how much effort you need to reach the point of those N7 500+ players that seem to have the Krysae rifle at level 10.

Other unknowns are whether different weapons have different rarity rates.  I don't think so, personally.  Or at least not by a big margin.

As a side note: on average the chance of getting a specific character or weapon that you want is 1/34, give and take, so if you want a specific character or brand new weapon from the latest DLC, you either need to play 24 games of gold, or pay EA $35 bucks for 17 premium packs. (assuming you haven't maxed out all weapons)

Hope you find this interesting!

1335742749.0,26,self.MECoOp,syuub,Carnifex X or Paladin V? Extended barrel or thermal clip?,27,1,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/syuub/carnifex_x_or_paladin_v_extended_barrel_or/,"The Paladin V is retardedly powerful, with the extended barrel it takes Geth troopers and rocket troopers with one headshot and one bar of Geth Primes armor for each shot on gold. I've been ignoring the Paladin for quite some time cause of the all super mega powerful Carnifex X but since my Paladin has reached level V now things like ammo capacity and weight is no longer a problem.

The way I see it, the good weapons in Mass Effect Coop seems to be the ones that do the most damage and expose you for the least amount of time, so with this being said I prefer the Paladin over the Carnifex at this point. The reload is only 1.5 seconds so I feel like the extended barrel is a better option then the higher clip capacity (I can't live without the scope, so I tend to have the dilemma between these two attachments), I rely [alot](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S8TRIo4br3I/AAAAAAAACv4/Zh7_GcMlRKo/s400/ALOT.png) on my accuracy as the Paladin is a sniper at this point with the one-shot headshot, I love being able to take down primes without relying on anyone else setting of my bio boom when I'm using my justicar.

So that's my thoughts on these pistols.

I think the choice of the attachments on pistols is based on preference rather then ""dis is teh best guaize"" as some people prefer the scope, while some prefer the extended firepower with both extended barrel and upgraded thermal clip capacity.

So with all this being said, what is your preferred pistol setup/attachments/character? Are there any fellow Paladin lovers out there? Some people using the Phalanx like I did in the first days of the game? 

Since it's mostly based on preference, I'd find it interesting to see what people on /r/mecoop use from their pistol arsenal (although the Carnifex is pretty much the king at this point).

EDIT: Almost forgot to mention this, I know the Paladin got patched and was made more powerful but smaller clip size.

I don't have a breakdown of the damage of Tech Burst vs. Fire Explosions, so I can't say for certain if this technique is the fastest for taking down a single Prime. However, the technique has certain advantages.

1. Lots of AOE damage that will hit the Prime that you are trying to kill and all his friends around. When Primes come in pairs, I can often alternate between detonating the drones that they continually spawn and therefore continuously deal damage to both of the Primes.

2. The alternative of casting ED/Overload and then Incinerate repeatedly (for the Tech Bursts) on the prime, interrupts the Biotic explosion setups. This is because ED and overload ""cover"" the Biotic effects present on an enemy, so that it can't be detonated until after the Tech Burst is detonated. When ED/Overload is used to trigger the Fire Explosion, this ""covering"" does not occur on the Prime (at least, I haven't seen it act that way). This means the team's DPS is increased.

3. It's fun to turn the glowing orbs into bombs.

1333160983.0,27,self.MECoOp,rlvpe,Changes I would like to see to objective waves.,28,1,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/rlvpe/changes_i_would_like_to_see_to_objective_waves/,"I know this has been talked about before but I wanted to list some of the things I would like to see changed/added.

**Changes:**

-I think it would be cool if on waves when you need to hack the console(camp around it) one person could actually use the console to increase the hacking speed. The person would have to be standing up at the console so they would be a big target and they obviously would not be able to help hold off enemies.

-On the waves where you need to kill certain targets the enemies could basically defend the targe. It would make waves where one of the big units like a banshee or a prime really hard, but more importantly it would make the early waves where it picks things like cannibals or troopers very interesting. The enemies could basically surround the target and try to defend them. It would also be nice if the targets were less gung-ho than they are.


**Added:**

-Retrieval: Adding optional objectives could be awesome too. Maybe during any objective wave some resources could spawn in the area. A player can then run and pick them up and carry them back to the landing zone for bonus credits or xp. The trick would come in that once carrying the item the player could no longer defend themselves and the enemies would try to get to the resources first to destroy them so you have to hurry to get them first. (This would also be very cool as a bonus to the extraction wave.)

-Squad: I was thinking of what would be a cool new objective wave and decided it would be cool if elite squads could show up. Basically what would happen is instead of random enemies spawning a squad of 5-10 enemies would spawn. When I say squad I mean they would have better AI and would help each other. So they would use cover better than the normal enemies, would be tougher, and would support each other. So instead of just running through doors they would put one at a door to cover the rest while they move into cover in the room. The other way you could handle the squad is make them only like 5 enemies but make it so once they go down they can pick each other back up like the players. That way you need to guard them after they are down or try to execute them in melee range. After the squad is defeated normal enemies would spawn to finish the wave but would only amount to 50% or so of a normal wave to compensate.

-Bomb: Another new objective wave could be planting a bomb(or something similair) where the players need to pick a bomb up at the LZ and carry it to an are where they have to plant and arm the bomb. This has 2 ways it could be implemented, either the players could plant the bomb anywhere so they can pick their own location or there is a designated zone they have to take it to, but then the players need to defend it while enemies try to disarm it. Something could be done here where either enemies need to get into melee to disarm it or enemies could shoot it and destroy it. There is a lot of choices for how this objective could be added as well as the option of either a timer or if the bomb is destroyed the mission is failed. (This objective would also work well as an alternative to an extraction.)

-Civilians: In these waves players would need to either find and escort civilians to the LZ or the players would need to revive civilians and escort them to the LZ. This objective would also work as either a bonus wave or instead of getting a time bonus you would get a bonus for rescuing more civilians than neccesary. (Again this would work well with an extracion wave. Giving you a time limit at the same time.)

-Bonus Wave: These waves would just be bonus waves. Players would have a huge advantage in these waves (something like increased health/damage or they all get heavy weapons from SP), and the wave only spawns the strong units. I have to say it would be awesome taking on 10 banshees and 10 brutes with heavy weapons on all the players.

-Surprise Attack: I've talked about this one being an option for a game mode but I think it would work as a surprise objective. In this one a race other than the current type would surprise you and fight you and the enemies. So for example you would be fighting the geth and cerberus troops would begin dropping in and fighting you and the geth. In this situation each enemy would spawn less than normal units for the wave (for example each would spawn 75% of a normal wave) this is to keep from having to fight an absurd number of enemies as they would also be killing each other.

-Assasination: This would be the opposite of the targeted enemy waves. In these waves one player would be chosen and all the enemies would be trying to kill that player. They would not ignore the other players but they would focus on trying to kill the marked target.

I just had my best (personal) gold run. Gold Firebase White against Geth. Two quarian infiltrators on their first or second gold run ever, and a vanguard of the bad sort.

[Click here for the imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/jMUw2/all).

Just as planned, the results have been organized and are ready for the public eye. I kept the graphs simple this time around and included as many raw numbers as possible. You'll see in virtually every graph that there's a percentage and a raw number beside it, as well as the sample size in the title (n= some number).

A lot of people had trouble answering every question, so that was necessary. Most of the graphs were best presented as pie charts (binary, proportion of population, etc.) and I wanted to stick with something almost everyone could read. You are free to draw your own conclusions.

Some notes:

* Answering every question is hard, apparently.

* Since I really screwed up the hours/games played question, I had to manually edit the data (1= checked, 0= unchecked). I simply dragged the 1 left and copied it into every cell to get the achieved effect. That was a bitch, 319 times.

* The titles were centered and pretty in Excel. My apologies.

* The hardest graphs to read are the ""Most/Least Played/Favored Difficulties"". Consider each bar its own pie graph: of that bar, you'll see the proportion at which each difficulty was ranked. The size of the bar is like the percentage; the number in the bar is the raw data.

* Based on the comments of the survey thread, it seemed most people were interested in how ~~special they were~~ they deviated from the population. I thought pie charts were the best way to illustrate that, but feel free to re-graph at your own leisure.

* Histograms are too much effort in Excel.

 Here are a few questions to encourage discussion:

* In what ways did you deviate from the norm?
* Did anything surprise you?
* Did you anticipate anything, only to learn you were correct?
* Did you enjoy the survey?

I was going into one of the toughest zones in the galaxy. Command called them ""Platinum Zones,"" all I knew is that I was going in alone. 

I had heard that there was a number of others who had completed this daring mission, but it would be my first. I was nervous. I wasn't one of the elite Furies from the N7 program, I was just a normal biotic. 

But I could do this. 

""5 minutes to dropoff."" The pilot's words echoed in my head, as if I didn't quite hear them. I could only hear the blood rushing past my eardrums.

I did one last rundown of my gear, checking everything was there piece by piece. I was good to go, my amps were running at peak capacity, my mags were loaded up. I was as prepared as I could be. 

I could do this. 

As the pilot took of with the shuttle, I looked at my surroundings. Turns out my mission was in the old Reactor. Probably could've gotten an easier one, but it'll do. After all, it was here that I got my first start. I know this map better than anyone.

Not 20 seconds after touching down, a squad of angry Cerberus soldiers came running at me, all clustered. I took them down easily enough. The ability to create mini black holes comes in handy in the field. One guy was still screaming in midair, so I shut him up by ripping him apart. Unfortunately, the entire compound heard the explosion. 

The game was on. 

Troves of Cerberus fell before me as I was well versed in their tactics. It took me awhile to take down the last Atlus before my comms started picking up a transmission from command. Apparently, I need to kill *more* guys on top of killing guys. High priority target or not, I'll get to 'em when I get to 'em. 

As I make my way through another wave of Cerberus cronies, I've noticed the Geth have now shown up. Fuck. Geth are pieces of shit. Apparently, they decided to upgrade themselves recently. Like they needed it. Bullshit flashlights. 

After snaking my way through, I got to my first target. Geth Prime. Not ideal. I shot his shield down and started to rip down his armor when a Phantom snuck up behind me. She lunged at me, but not quickly enough. I sent a shockwave through her as hard as I could and she went flying. Probably dead. I focused back on the Prime, it was almost down. A quick shockwave to detonate what I had already set up and on to the next target. 

The rest of the targets went down quickly enough, but it was getting awfully crowded. I ran into the reactor core and managed to draw in about a dozen tangos with me. When the last of them stepped inside, I rushed out, slamming my fist on the reactor vent activators. I smiled as I heard the hiss of the closing doors, but the the troves of enemies in front of me quickly dashed those away. 

This would be a long fight.

The Reapers finally had shown up. Right as I'm having to hack into a goddamn mainframe or some bullshit, there's a Brute bearing down on me. He charges, I dodge. He swings as he turns to face me, making contact, smashing me into a wall. The area's getting crowded, but I only have a few more seconds to finish. 

Not enough it seems, as a banshee pops up right behind me. I know better to fuck with a banshee up close, so I take off. I sprint past what must be an entire legion of enemies, knowing I only have a few minutes before that data is lost and my entire mission will be for naught.

I get to the other side of the reactor and hunker down. I don't have to make a stand, but I do need to last long enough to pull the majority of them over. My gear's all shot, my amps are nearly fried and I was losing confidence. I barely have myself composed when the first of the legion scurries around the corner. I pick of targets as they appear, making sure they go down quickly as possible. I have about 15 seconds of hacking left and about a minute to do it in. I haul ass back to the terminal and finish up. As it's being uploaded, three banshees are on me. Where the hell did they come from?! I dodge their sweeping grabs and make a beeline for a spot of cover. I fire of everything I have in their direction, not taking my focus off them for a second. Suddenly, a missle hits me in the back. Fuck! I hadn't paid attention to the eight billion other things. I had one medpack left. I couldn't waste it. I scampered out of cover taking out mooks as I hurried the hell out of that corridor. 

""Get to the LZ, I'm inbound."" The pilot was on his way back, thank god. I pulled out my last missle, and took out the approaching wave of baddies. It seemed like an eternity, but the second that shuttle was in reach, I jumped in. I threw out the last of what I had, and immediately passed out.

Now this has been in the pipeline for about 3 months, which is quite a while and I imagine you're getting a little impatient. So I'm writing this post to make sure I have my bases covered and that I'm not missing anything important. If there is something important that I am missing, please let me know. Sometimes I take things for granted that shouldn't, like inventory checks and whatnot.

So I chose to divide this into 3 sections. The first is **Pregame Knowledge**, which focuses on how prepared one is before entering a lobby. This includes builds, inventory, mental preparation, and social aspects (protip: bring friends). The second section is **Lobby Knowledge**, which will cover map and enemy compositions along with team power interactions. In particular, I plan to spend some time discussing how kits can mesh together to play effectively as a team with regards to powersets. The final section will be **In-Game Knowledge**, regarding how to play once at a firebase. InterwebNinja already covered a good portion of it with his Transition to Gold, but there are a few tips that are much more important on Platinum than on Gold. In each of these sections, two videos will accompany them on each step of the way in order to outline my thinking process on the matter. The first is one with a [Vorcha Sentinel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWPtCpLluqE) and the second involves a [Vanilla Human Sentinel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3Mix8kv_bY). Both involve Sentinels and Reapers and I wish I had more variety, but video recording tends to hate me. On the plus side, I think there's enough variety between the two videos to show how to approach Platinum from two different angles.

So now for a more detailed summary. Keep in mind that this is a rough outline and not the final product yet. I hope to have a final product by Sunday, but I don't want to set up a date and disappoint you guys.

___________________________________________________________

**Pregame Knowledge**

So you think you're ready for Platinum? Before you hop into a lobby you should check some things off:

* Is Platinum right for you? If it's just for the credits you can just roll with 3 friends for Glacier Cobra farming.

* There's a small gear check you need to pass. Even a Level 20 Geth Infiltrator will have problems without good equipment backing him up. Don't skimp out on consumable equipment when playing Platinum, though some equipment like Cyclonic Modulators and Assault Rifle Rail Amps are quite precious.

* In addition to a basic gear check, an arsenal check is needed as well. That Predator X is as effective as throwing change at Banshees. If you have a Paladin I, that's probably a better option.

* Is your build up to snuff? Consider how effective it is against [different enemy types](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/zwxzi/the_definitively_not_definitive_guide_to_guides/) and ask what is its role. The [Big Bad List of Builds](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/wiki/bigbadlistofbuilds) can help with that. Ask yourself why your build is effective on Platinum.

* Related to the above point, does your build have special tricks that can help it? Perhaps the ability to hide the reload animation or create invincibility frames. Look at some of the MeCoOp College posts to see the ins and outs of some powers to gain the upper hand. Did you know that Collectors Swarms don't affect your cooldown if you have Marksman or Adrenaline Rush active?

* A special mention to the three ""crutch"" kits: AIU, TGI, and Geth Juggernaut. Mostly the Scrubbernaut.

* Are you willing to risk playing with Platinum PUGs? Most of the time they go well but co-ordinating with teammates generally yields better results. Consider using meetup threads and userlists to find other players to play with you.

________________________________________

**Lobby Knowledge**

* Are you ready to face every enemy? Do you have a good idea on what enemy spawns in which wave? Are you prepared for Geth on Wave 6 of a Cerberus Platinum game? Can you handle the onslaught of Dragoons and Geth Hunters during Cerberus Extraction?

* Do you understand how the wave budget system works? Knowing how it works lets one plow through a game in record time.

* Can you handle the map present? Some maps are good for grenade kits given their massive grenade supplies while others are practically dry for grenades. In particular, choose maps based on their objective waves as those are the toughest. Some maps have particularly tough objective waves (Rio, London) and extra precaution should be taken if possible. Is range going to be an issue? Some powers (Flamer) and weapons (Reegar) have range limitations that make less effective outside their ideal range. Maps like Dagger and Rio are a nightmare for short range kits when objective waves roll around.

* Now with that out of the way, how do you contribute to the team? Do you act as Power Combo primer or detonator on a combo-dependent team? Can you tank and bring the heat off of other teammates (Juggernaut) or is your job to do spray DPS all over a target (GI, Reegar AIU)? Are you a Shield/Barrier stripper (GE) for a kit that chews through Armor (N7 Destroyer with Incendiary PPR)?

* Speaking of Power Combos, how well can your team make them? You can mix Tech and Biotic combos but it takes some skill to prevent dilution. Having too many primers/detonators also means that Power Combos can't go off as often to make them a solid source of damage throughout the game. Multi-primers/multi-detonators go a long way in increasing how effective Power Combos are.

__________________________________________

**In Game Knowledge**

* Now the rubber hits the floor. How much are you willing to risk to get the job done? Sometimes it's fine to take your sweet time but during objective waves time is of the essence. No need to burn equipment outside of objective waves unless the circumstances demand it.

* Don't die and kill stuff. Captain Obvious had to say that.

* Do you notice something that can help/hinder your team? For example, you notice a Reegar AIU with Incendiary Rounds and you have Flamer that does 2.25x damage against Armor. Consider briefly using Flamer on an enemy the AIU is attacking to deal Incendiary cheese damage to kill said enemy quicker.

* Look at how your teammates play. Reasonably predicting how a teammate plays can help you formulate a plan to keep him/her alive.

* Perhaps you notice something a teammate is doing that's really cool, like lining up Shockwaves to detonate multiple Power Combos at once. You can still learn when playing. Sometimes you don't notice something until in-game but don't be afraid to adjust your play on the fly.

* DPS is the most important aspect in Platinum. Sure staying alive helps with the DPS, but slowly hemorrhaging the enemies may put you in more danger than you realize.

[build]( http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Vanguard/Cabal/FLKNF/Valiant10BJ5AS5//SniperRifleRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator3/GrenadeCapacity5/)

The powers are the same as /u/spark2 's [build](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19rgd6/this_chick_is_caballin_cabal_vanguard_build/), but the strategy is different enough to warrant it's own post.

***

The key to sniping is killing stuff at range before it gets too close for your ridiculously large gun to target.  Obvious, right?  But if we could all do that every time, we'd all be running GIs with Javelins and Platinum would be solved like a savant's Rubik's cube.  This build is for those of us who sometimes need a panic button when something gets through.  The Cabal has three excellent panic buttons, and they all serve a different purpose.  

* The first is **Poison Strike**.  This is not Biotic Charge, and anyone who compares the two is bad and they should feel bad.  If you ever poison an enemy with PS, it was probably by accident.  It is, however, the most mobile power in the game.  You can hop up to sniper perches, teleport through walls, play matador with a Brute's charge, and escape from pretty much any hairy situation.  As such, the range evolution is as far as I go.

* The second panic button is **Nightshade Blades**.  One reason I end up on the floor when I typically play snipers is drawing a sidearm is too damn slow.  By the time my hurricane is ready to fire, I'm mashing the omnikey and hoping for a friendly revive.  The Cabal's sidearm is *literally* her sidearm.  When an enemy gets too close, pop one of these for insta-stagger, then headshot (or bravely run away).  Since this is a grenade power, you can teleport away if you're feeling fancy.  The 6th evolution for exploding blades gives you a second stagger if you need it, but feel free to take damage if you're using offense as a defense.

* This brings us to the third panic button, **Biotic Focus**.  This little beauty is a magical fire extinguisher, cancelling Atlas rocket fire, banshee cancer, swarmer stings, and ravager puddles.  It restores your barriers, gives damage resistance, and higher move speed, all for 20 seconds on a &lt;4s cooldown.  You should pretty much use this whenever you get shot.  This power will let you keep firing, and firing, and firing.

Which brings us to the butter of this build's bread.  **The N7 Valiant**.  I've been blessed by the RNG, and my Valiant is at six while the rest of my URs languish in the ones and twos.  This gun has the highest sustained DPS of any sniper rifle in the game (no really, [look it up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgoNSTctMEekdHIwa081S0FBVS1ZZzdWeXRnbGRDYnc#gid=8)), it has a forgiving 3-shot clip, and with the Turian passives it has *almost zero recoil*.  The reload animation is very fast, so you don't need to reload cancel if that's not your thing.  And with Biotic Focus, you can stay out of cover longer to lay down the hurt.  This gun chews through mooks and bosses alike, and has almost no downside.

One nice aspect of this build is it is not reliant on any particular consumable.  AP ammo is probably the best for random teams, otherwise use whatever synergizes well with your teammates.  Cyclonic mods make Biotic Focus even more godly, but I'm always low on those.  Literally any armor mod (save stability, you really don't need it) benefits her to some degree.  For gear, I'd use grenade capacity if I had it, otherwise just use a Sniper amp.

**Conclusion**

This build is gold-viable and a very well balanced sniper kit for those of us who can't manage the l33t javelol wallhax.  If you've always wanted to play a sniper but always seem to die in a panic, this class is for you.

---

**Biotic Charge** - We're stopping at Rank 4 for the Radius evolution. In this build, Charge is only used for occasional utility and to get around the map.

**Stasis** - Level this power all the way to Rank 6 for skull-blasting goodness. At Rank 4 you want Duration, so you can spend more time sniping. Your bullets should be strong enough to head-shot kill most enemies, so the Stasis Strength evolution is mostly irrelevant (unless your squadmates are specifically trying to annoy you by spraying pea-shooters). At Rank 5, pick Recharge Speed over Bonus Power. We're playing as a weapons class, and I prefer consistency to the stress of gambling with the RNG. At Rank 6, Bubble is your best friend.

**Lift Grenade** - All 6 levels. I chose Damage at Rank 4, because I generally ONLY use grenades on big bosses (I don't like being leashed to ammo boxes) for extra oomph and setting off power combos. The Radius revolution doesn't interest me. Rank 5 Max Grenades, and Rank 6 Damage &amp; Radius. The other evo's provide little benefit for this build.

**Asari Adept** - All 6 levels of the racial ability, and go straight weapon damage. Your cooldowns will be fine. If you're obsessed with grenades, you could switch out Rank 4, but 5 and 6 are not optional.

**Fitness** - Take it to Rank 4 Durability. If interested, check out the [survivability thresholds](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/139h8o/lets_talk_fitness_and_survivability/) to figure out whether you want additional equipment to boost your shields. Example: A Banshee Warp does 490/745/990/1,176 damage on each of the 4 difficulties.

---

**Kishock Harpoon Gun** This is your money-maker. The talent calculator is telling me the damage is 1,809.28 with the current Gear, Equipment, and Mods. You can (should) charge up your shots to boost that damage further, assuming it's not already factored into the calculator. Aim for the head, because you get a gorgeous 3x headshot multiplier. It's a projectile weapon so it ignores shield gates and armor reduction. You can hip-fire with zero sniper rifle damage penalty. The first 2/3s of the damage are immediate, and the rest is applied as a damage-over-time (very short duration) which helps delay enemy shield/barrier recharge.

For the negatives, the Kishock is a single-shot weapon, so you'd better be able to reload cancel ([PC](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/191guy/me3_coop_college_tips_and_tricks_505_reload/), [Console](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/19s44r/mecoop_college_tips_and_tricks_505_reload/)). Since it is a projectile weapon, anything that is not stasis'd might be difficult to hit due to travel time of the shot, especially if you are playing off-host. There is a slight downward arc to each shot that can be reduced by charging up the weapon. 

**Weapon Mods** Extended Barrel (+damage) and Enhanced Scope (see through smoke) is my preferred loadout. Centurions and Atlases love to thwart your line-of-sight to Stasis Bubble with smoke grenades. If smoke doesn't bother you or you know the enemy faction ahead of time, swap the scope for Spare Thermal Clip (+ammo). Any weapon mod with Ignore Armor is redundant/useless, since projectile weapons have this property inherently.

**Hurricane** Optional but highly recommended if you are playing against random enemies. Unless you are incredibly clutch at hitting fast movers, Cerberus Dragoons and Geth Bombers (2 out of the 4 enemy factions) can quickly overwhelm your position. This is a backup sidearm to cover a specific tactical weakness with this kit, so mod the weapon with a High-Velocity Barrel (armor ignore) and Ultra-Light Materials (-weapon weight).

---

**Gear and Equipment**

For the permanent gear slot, use Guerilla Upgrade (+SR and SMG damage) OR Sniper Rifle Amp (+SR damage). Any other gear with +sniper rifle damage can be used, if you're still working on your manifest.

For equipment, use Cyclonic Modulators (+shields) when you can spare them and Targeting VI's (+headshot damage) or Sniper Rifle Amps (+SR damage). Any other Armor equipment is justifiable as an alternative, except for Stabilization Modules IMO.

Top choices for ammo are Incendiary, Warp, or Phasic. Note that Incendiary, Warp, Cryo, and Disruptor will allow you to prime bosses for power combos, and apply secondary debuffs. Phasic is excellent for blasting through boss shields and barriers (10x damage multiplier!), but if any teammates are using Acolyte pistols you'll get more mileage from a priming ammo type. Avoid Explosive, because it can break the Stasis of other enemies caught in your bubble. If you're desperate, Drill and Armor Piercing Ammo are alright for the bonus damage vs armor and health, but you won't benefit from the cover penetration and armor piercing properties.

---

**Strategy**

Find a safe, tactical position to provide sniper fire on a large portion of the map. Drop Stasis Bubbles on non-armored enemies and rake in the headshots. Don't get tunnel vision'd into your scope. Check your flanks often, and move if you find yourself alone on the opposite side of the map from your team. Use Biotic Charge to quick-travel, recharge your shields, avoid boss attacks, and stagger/knock down enemies that get too close. Note that you can charge up your Kishock before a Biotic Charge, release the trigger mid-flight, and the gun will fire directly into center-of-mass. Useful for guaranteeing a mook's demise if you're unsure Biotic Charge can get the job done. When dealing with bosses, you should try for headshots if you can manage, but even an uncharged body shot is better than a miss. This is especially true if your ammo power primes the boss for a Lift Grenade combo explosion.

You will eat phantoms for breakfast with this build. Happy head-shotting!

Can anyone let me know when I can be sync killed, and when it's safe to be in melee range?

So far I know Atlas' will only do it after a melee, Brutes only do it when their eyes are red, Phantoms only do it after a melee, but I'm at a loss for Scions, Praetorians and Banshees.

Summary of mechanics  
- If host characters hit the bubble with a hitscan weapon (piercing is unnecessary), it will do direct health damage to the phantom. No barrier damage will be inflicted without ammo. This damage is reduced by 75% (assuming DR instead of shield gate).  
- If off-host characters hit the bubble with a hitscan weapon, it will do normal barrier damage.  
- In all cases, graal shots did direct health damage and receive the 75% penalty.  
- Approximately 2m worth of penetration is required to double hit the phantom reliably with a headshot. One shot can hit the bubble along with the phantom’s body.  
- For double hit consistency, shoot the head of the phantom while it is facing you in her bubble.  
- Ammo damage applies twice on double hits.  
- Ammo damage applies normally (as though the phantom's body was hit) when the bubble is hit. This is the same for both hosts and off-host shooters.

vs Banshees  
Banshees can also be double-hit if they are in their power blocking effect.
The mechanics are similar to the phantom except that host shots on the bubble will not inflict direct armour damage.

Interesting possibilities  
~~Any HOST sniper infiltrator can 1 shot gold phantoms in bubble with a headshot.~~  
~~Setup required:~~  
~~mantis X (piercing V, HVB V)~~  
~~80% damage cloak + 25% sniper~~  
~~phasic ammo III~~  
~~25% weapon damage passives or gear (e.g. 10% passives + 15% SR gear)~~

~~Any off-host character can do the same with this setup~~
~~Setup required:~~  
~~Mantis X (piercing V, HVB V)~~  
~~phasic ammo III~~  
~~No rail amp, gear or even skill points is required.~~

This lets any HOST sniper infiltrator (even duration spec) to 1 shot gold phantoms with a bodyshot.  
Setup required:  
Widow X: 1,246 (piercing V, HVB V, 2.85m pen.)  
40% damage cloak + 25% sniper  
Disruptor IV: 25% to health. 100% to shields and barriers


Off-host sniper infiltrators can do the same with lesser equipment  
Mantis X: 886.4 (piercing V, HVB V, 2.35m pen.)  
80% damage cloak + 25% sniper  
Disruptor III: 15% to health. 60% to shields and barriers


A host max-damage GI can also cheese a gold phantom using the following setup:  
Max damage GI + javelin X + barrel + SR Rail II + SR Gear V  
or  
Max damage GI (with speed hunter mode) + javelin X + barrel + SR Rail III + SR Gear V

cloak + proxy mine + shoot bubble (no body hit needed) = instant kill

In the process of reviewing a lot of builds in the BBLoBs, I was surprised to see that what I consider to be the 'classic' Human Engineer builds aren't on the list, and most of the ones currently posted were before the changes to tech combos.  The build(s) I'm posting here have come up in comments several times on this forum, but I thought it would be helpful to make a post dedicated to them.  This has been one of my favorite classes since the game was released and I still play it regularly.  I recommend you give it another shot if you haven't played it recently.

####BUILD

Build 1, the 'classic', is [**HERE**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Engineer/Human/PLLID/Paladin8BK5AI5//PistolRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator3/PistolAmp5/).  Note, this is somewhat similar to [RepublicanShredder's Lord of Tech Bursts build](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/ygcwa/lord_of_the_tech_bursts_human_engineer/), with the exception of some extra points in Fitness and some more playstyle considerations that I'll cover below.  Probably a more common alternative to this 'classic' would be a 6/6/6/4/4, but they're both pretty similar.

Alternatively, Build 2 [**HERE**](http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Engineer/Human/DLLIR/Paladin8BK5AI5//PistolRailAmp3/CyclonicModulator3/PistolAmp5/) is similar in playstyle, but has a little extra durability at the expense of points in the Combat Drone.

####POWERS

***Overload:***  This is a fairly standard Overload spec.  By taking Neural Shock in Evolution 5 and Shield Damage in Evolution 6, you get up to a 6x multiplicative bonus against synthetics, and 8x against organics, while still hitting two targets (applies to shields / barriers).  These are must-have evolutions on this class, IMO.  With the specific loadouts I've linked, Overload will do enough damage to take out the Shields / Barriers of every enemy in the game on Gold except for Phantoms, Hunters, and Pyros.

***Incinerate:***  This is maxed for armor damage.  I see little reason to take Radius on this power, when you're primarily using it against large, heavy enemies.  If you're wondering about the mechanics behind Incinerate, it does 75% of its damage upfront, and then another 25% as a 3 second DoT.  If you take Armor Damage, as I've done here, you will add another 50% multiplicative damage bonus that is an 8 second DoT.   With the loadouts I've linked, that means you will do about 1600 damage against armor within the first 3 seconds, and about 2000 total damage after the full eight seconds.  

One other thing to note is that if you want to dedicate one of your two Human Engineer classes to using Cryo Ammo, you could go with the Freeze Combo in Evolution 6.  That may yield you more overall Incinerate damage, depending on the weapon you are using.

***Passive:*** This is just to max the Power Damage of Overload and Incinerate.  You could take the Weapon Damage in Evolution 6, but IMO, not really worth it given the other 2 remaining powers.

***Combat Drone:*** This is where the two builds diverge.  Build 1 is your classic crowd control drone build.  Excellent for staggering groups of lower-tier enemies.  Build 2 is meant as more of a distraction for heavy enemies like Primes or Atlases.  Note, melee enemies like Banshees, Brutes, and Husks now ignore the Combat Drone.

***Fitness:*** Build 2 just invests in extra durability over the Combat Drone.  As a result, it may scale a little better to higher difficulties, especially Platinum, where lower-tier crowd control isn't as helpful.

####PLAYSTYLE

With Build 1, against a group of lower-tier enemies, open with a Combat Drone to distract / stagger them.  Combat Drone has an extremely fast cooldown, so you should be able to follow up with a quick Overload to strip shields, and then finish off with weapons fire / mixed powers as necessary.  Note, it's generally not worth detonating a Tech Burst using Incinerate.  A 6+6 Tech Burst actually does less shield / barrier damage than a single cast of Overload.  The Tech Burst will yield a slightly higher damage against Health, so situationally, it might offer a small benefit.  I just never bother.

With Build 2, I won't necessarily open with the Drone so much.  It's used more situationally to distract strategic enemies, especially heavy ones like Atlases or Primes.  Or, if being approached from the flank, I may quickly cast it to distract an enemy while addressing other ones that are a more imminent threat.  This strategy is valid with Build 1 as well.

With either build, the approach against bosses is pretty much the same.  If they can be distracted by the Drone, I'll launch it (and honestly, out of habit, I often launch it regardless).  Against a shielded enemy, I Overload / weapons fire until shields are stripped.  Then when the enemy is down to armor, I alternate, in order, Incinerate and Overload for Fire Explosions, mixed in with weapons fire between the cooldowns.  With these setups, you'll be doing close to 4000 of anti-armor damage damage per cycle, not including whatever damage you are getting from your weapon.

####WEAPONS

I like something with medium burst damage for this class.  Too much burst damage on a class with Overload is wasted, IMO - a Wraith would be preferable to a Claymore, and personally, I prefer pistols on this class.  Paladin is great at decent ranges, and Talon is another alternative, though its shield-stripping bonuses are somewhat wasted when you have a power like Overload.  Paladin is probably my #1 choice, and it's what I have included in the build links.  I'd also consider the Carnifex, Mattock, or even Indra.

####EQUIPMENT

The base human classes are a little flimsy, and I often like to use Cyclonic Modulators, or some other form of shield boosting Gear on them.  With this class, I think the main choice comes down to whether you want to use a Power Amplifier or a Cyclonic Modulator.  Using a Power Amp IV can get you over that Gold Phantom barrier threshold.  And, Incinerate will do noticeably more damage against armor.  So, your choice... survivability, or damage?  I tend to favor the former.

As for ammo types, Cryo Ammo works if you want to take the Freeze Combo in Incinerate, otherwise, I'd probably just keep it simple with AP Ammo.  Especially with the Paladin, where I think you have to use the Heavy Barrel and Extended Mag.  Trying to slot Guardians without any AP ability can be tedious.

####SUMMARY

Give the Human Engineers another shot.  I never see anyone using them, even though they're an excellent class.  It's arguably the best class in the game for self-detonating Fire Explosions.",[Build],False,self,t5_2tkk1,1372236778.0,,PS3,True,t3_1a7efg,http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/1a7efg/youre_my_boy_blue_human_engineer_build/,

These add-ons are crucial for maximizing build potential and for adapting to certain needs.

Each weapon can be equipped with at most two modifications at a time which can be freely chosen before a match starts. Certain modifications cannot be used in tandem.  Mods are obtained as permanent cards from packs purchased in the store and come in common, uncommon, and rare varieties.

For the entry, it will be assumed that the reader has an understanding of various game mechanics such as armour DR. For more information, see [Class 401: Intro to Weapons](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/179vze/class_401_introduction_to_weapons/)

---

**WEAPON MODIFICATIONS**
---

Mods will be broken down into several sections:

* *Effect*: A description of what the mod does
* *Weapon Availability*: Weapons that have this mod and any variants
* *Conflicts*: Mods that cannot be used at the same time, if applicable. No weapon mod may be stacked with itself.
* *Applications*: Ideal uses for this mod

For the sake of simplicity, modifications will be referred to in this section by their effect since mods for different weapons may have different names, but have the same effect. Some mods have a variant that offers increased power, but usually with additional weight.

*It is also worth noting that any mods that are supposed to add weight are currently bugged. For all weapons that were not released in DLCs, the beneficial aspects are added, but the weight increase is not.*

**DAMAGE INCREASE**

*Effect:* Increases the weapon's damage by a percentage of the weapon's base damage. Additive bonus

*Weapon Availability*: Available on all weapons. Pistols have a stronger version that adds weight and has the same conflicts.

*Conflicts*:  Some versions of Piercing, Damage/Piercing Hybrid. Pistol variants cannot stack with each other 

*Applications*: Increased damage is one of the most standard modifications for guns. Nearly every gun will benefit greatly from simply dealing more damage. When in doubt, this mod is never a bad choice.

**PIERCING**

*Effect*: Ignores armour DR by a percentage, additive with other sources of armour penetration. Increases amount of cover penetration for a weapon (additive bonus). Weapons without innate cover piercing will also suffer a damage penalty when going through cover.

*Weapon Availability*: Available on all weapons. ARs have a stronger variant that adds weight and conflicts with Damage Increase.

*Conflicts*: SMG version conflicts with Damage Increase, AR version conflicts with Weight Reduction.

*Applications*: After damage, piercing is usually regarded as the second best mod. Penetrating armour DR is vital for most SMGs, shotguns, and ARs for maximum damage. Cover penetration is also useful, especially on maps with lots of thin cover and Cerberus or with weapons that come with innate cover piercing. However, this mod has no use whatsoever on projectile weapons.

**DAMAGE/PIERCING HYBRID**

*Effect*: Combines the effects of the Damage Increase and Piercing mods, but adds weight

*Weapon Availability*: Shotguns, SRs

*Conflicts*: Damage increase

*Applications*: Being able to have both Damage and Piercing at the same time often offers a significant increase in overall damage output, but requiring two slots means other useful mods may be skipped. Certain weapons such as the Javelin and the Piranha benefit greatly from other options and the hybrid mod allows for the solid effects of damage and piercing without sacrificing auxiliary effects. Users should be careful of the weight increase on certain characters.  

**WEIGHT REDUCTION**

*Effect*: Reduces the weapon's weight by a percentage, reducing CD penalty.

*Weapon Availability*: Available on all weapons.

*Conflicts*: SMG version conflicts with Stability, AR version conflicts with regular Piercing

*Applications:* Reducing the weight of a weapon can make it more suitable on certain classes that need high CDR bonus. It may even allow for feasible carrying of two weapons without heavily impacting cooldowns. However, players should not be too overly concerned with reducing weight. As a general rule of thumb, 150% is plenty for almost all casters and anything above 100% is great for other characters.

**MAGAZINE SIZE INCREASE**

*Effect*: Increases the capacity of a weapon's magazine by a percentage.

*Weapon Availability*: SMGs, ARs, and Heavy Pistols

*Conflicts*: AR version conflicts with weight reduction. 

*Applications:* This mod is good on weapons that either have a significant reload times, high rate of fire, low magazine capacity, or some combination of all three. For some weapons it can make a large impact in overall usability of the weapon whereas for others it comes down to user preference. Keep in mind that each magazine will consume a larger portion of reserve ammunition. For ""cooldown"" weapons like the Lancer and ramp up weapons like the Typhoon, this mod is extremely powerful.

**SPARE AMMUNITION**

*Effect*: Increases the reserve ammunition capacity for a weapon by a percentage.

*Weapon Availability*: SRs, Shotguns

*Conflicts*: No conflicts

*Applications*: This mod generally comes down to user preference. Only a few select weapons actually have reserve ammunition issues and ammo crates are usually easy for players to find. It is important to note that this mod does not work on any ""cooldown"" weapons like the Lancer.

**MELEE DAMAGE INCREASE**

*Effect*: While the weapon is out, increases melee damage by a percentage. Multiplicative bonus

*Weapon Availability*: Pistols, Shotguns, ARs. The shotgun variant gives more damage, but adds weight.

*Conflicts*: Melee mods cannot be stacked on the same weapon

*Applications*: Use of this mod should be fairly straightforward. Equip on weapons for melee-centric builds. Due to the multiplicative nature of the bonus, these mods add a hefty increase in damage.

**SCOPE**

*Effect*: Changes the zoom fire of a gun to use a magnifying scope. In addition, accuracy is increased and the gun becomes slightly more controllable when scoped or moving. For sniper rifles, the basic version also comes with the ability to highlight enemies through Cerberus smoke and the variant highlights enemies through walls. Adding a scope will also replace the existing scope, but will not change magnification.

*Weapon Availability*: Pistols, SRs, ARs. Snipers and ARs have a weight adding wallhacking variant.

*Conflicts*: Power Damage Increase

*Applications*: Having a scope on non-scoped weapons is often user preference. The increased accuracy and ability to engage targets from further away is a trade off for other possibilities. For pistols, it is highly popular on headshot builds and works well with the headshot damage increase. On sniper rifles most of the stats are wasted as they are already very accurate and most of them are single-shot. The smoke and wall hacking usually has limited use as well. However, some players prefer to take scopes on all their rifles so they do not have to learn different sets of cross hairs as some rifles have rather varied scopes.  

**STABILIZER**

*Effect*: Reduces the recoil (distance that a player's reticule jumps each shot) for a weapon by a percentage

*Weapon Availability*: SMGs, ARs

*Conflicts*: Reduced Weight on SMGs

*Applications*: Some SMGs and ARs have a significant RoF, recoil, or combination of the two that makes them harder to handle and keep shots on target. The stabilizer can be a great choice in making a weapon easier to use.

**POWER DAMAGE INCREASE**

*Effect*: While the weapon is out, increases power damage by a percentage. Additive bonus

*Weapon Availability*: SMGs, Pistols

*Conflicts*: Scopes

*Applications*: Players who rely more on powers than weapons for doling out damage will favour this mod. However, it is important to remember that biotic and tech combos do not benefit from power damage increases and for powers with low base damage, taking a weapon damage based mod or even a stronger and heavier weapon might provide more benefit.

---

*The last three mods will be referred to by their names since they are unique and are better recognized when called as such*

**HEAT SINK**

*Effect*: Each shot fired has a chance to not consume ammunition

*Weapon Availability*: SMGs only

*Conflicts*: None

*Applications*: In all cases except the Collector SMG, the heat sink is superior to the magazine increase mod. While on average it only provides 1-2% more shots per clip than the magazine size increase (a minor and even occasionally unreliable boost), the heat sink is actually consuming less ammunition which means fewer trips to ammo crates. However when used together with the magazine mod, users will be able to keep up the fire for an impressive amount of time. 

As mentioned earlier, the CSMG gains no benefit from this mod.

**SMART CHOKE**

*Effect*: Increases accuracy by a significant percentage

*Weapon Availability*: Shotguns only

*Conflicts*: Reduced Weight

*Applications*: The smart choke is one of the most potent shotgun mods. One of the main issues with many shotguns is they are extremely inaccurate and spread their  shots over a fairly wide area, forcing users to get into extremely close ranges to be effective. By using this mod, shots are grouped much tighter, making some shotguns usable from more comfortable distances while allowing others to essentially snipe targets at medium long ranges.

It is worth noting that the projectile shotguns gain very little benefit, if at all, from this mod.

**CRANIAL TRAUMA SYSTEM**

*Effect*: Increases damage dealt headshots by a large amount. Additive bonus

*Weapon Availability*: Pistols only

*Conflicts*: Damage

*Applications*: This is a nifty mod that essentially acts as the heavy damage increase mod, but only for headshots and without weight addition. It is usually best taken on specific headshot builds. Be cautioned that this will provide no damage increase when targets are not hit in the head and thus the regular damage mod may be more reliable.

Want to bad mouth someone, pick on something else about them or their play style.

•Unless Rule One Is Broken. NO CRYING TO THE MODS BECAUSE SOMEONE MADE FUN OF YOU! This Is A Rant Thread. You Post In Here At Your Own Risk. Be wary of griefers, trolls, haters, and bullies.

•Leave It In The Rant Threads. DO NOT USE THESE THREADS TO PASS JUDGEMENT OUTSIDE OF MECoOP OR THE THREADS STOP! These threads are being made to relieve some of the clutter on the main page and are a privilege we are allowing. These can be fun and please don't abuse them.

•Keep It In The Rant Thread. NO STARTING THREADS COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING FOR THE SAKE OF RANTING! These threads are made for that. There are acceptable rant based threads. Creating one with the title ""Anyone else tired of those stupid Krogan Mudertrains blocking your shot?"" with comments and content doing nothing but bashing them and making fun of them are no longer allowed. Acceptable threads are titled and contain content such as ""Can we get the Krogan Vanguards to learn to move instead of blocking a shot?"" and constructive tips, ideas, comments, and strategies to help said Krogan.

•Have Fun. YOU WILL OR I WILL MAKE YOU! No, really. These threads can be fun and stress relieving. Come in these threads with a few things in mind: You will get trolled, you will get made fun of, you will yell, caps lock will be used, grammar will not be correct, tempers will flair, and things will be said that you may regret when you sober up.
