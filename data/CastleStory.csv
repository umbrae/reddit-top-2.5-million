1359402631.0,141,self.CastleStory,17g2nz,So what's new?,149,8,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/17g2nz/so_whats_new/,"I came back on reddit for the first time in months today and realized that there were a lot of angry gamer here. I understand why you are angry but I can assure you that there is developpement being done. I know that there is a lot of discussion about the t-shirts and I suppose it is because we talked about it a lot. The reason we talked about it is because we want to get rid of that aspect of the kickstarter. This is a lot of work and kickstarter didn't really helped us out with their shitty form. BUT we don't work on that all day. We do a lot of experimenting. Personally I work a lot on migrating our database on better servers. We already tried Herok/appfog but they didn't worked like we wanted so we are trying another solution. We need something solid for the type of gaming we are aiming for and something that work 3/4 of the time is not good enoug.. you might have seen some issues on the http://sauropodstudio.com. We used the same system for our game.

The radial menu is a big change in the gameplay. It is something that will completly change the way you create/build/etc and it was a big issue in the prototype version of the game. There is  a lot more to tell but I will let Germain talk about it when he's ready.

we finally found a way to patch efficiently the game. We first started with a custom way to do it but it was a complete hell, then we looked for different specialized company like Solid State Network or Pando but they have ridiculous pricing. We finally found a solution but I cannot talk about it yet since i'm under a NDA. 

big changes on the pathfinding systems too. that more François's work so I cannot tell what are the technicals differences but it's working way better at this point. 

Our newcommer Paolo is working on the multiplayer and he's working a lot with me testing new systems. We also work on the new castlestory.net website that will change a lot. 

We have our sound guy working here, creating and implementing, I didn't had the chance to hear what was recently implemented because I'm almost never there at the same time of the others. 

But what took us a lot of time too is moving to the studio. You might say that is not for what you backed us but since the whole team was almost living at my appartment I must say it is maybe the most important thing we needed to do. I had to be at my home from 8am to 9pm since not everyone here work on the same hours. Not being able to live a social life for 4 months was a bit hard but I always thouht that it was only for a little time. We aren't even completly settled yet but it's getting together. I personally miss my good internet connection but for everything else is is getting enjoyable. 

So there is a lot of other changes but I think you understand that we don't really talk about paperwork and things like that. 

If you have questions, ask them. I will try to come here more often. I'm usanlly not a reddit guy but I know that a lot of our community came from here so I will make an effort :)",,False,self,t5_2tb9e,False,,dev,True,t3_17g2nz,http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/17g2nz/so_whats_new/,

1345330905.0,91,self.CastleStory,yg4qa,So I sent some questions to Sauropods team...,101,10,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/yg4qa/so_i_sent_some_questions_to_sauropods_team/,"Dear Germain Couët, François Alain &amp; Benoît Alain.


I followed this games development when it was first annouced on YouTube ""first demonstration"", so please take the time to read this mail, I would preciate that.


Questions:


1) Will players be able to play the map with the Castle used in the Castle Story trailer &amp; ""Castle Story - Gameplay demostration 2"" ?

**1) The island on from the trailer is actually kind of small once you get used to it. We would like player to be able to play on bigger ones than that. We may, however, place that island in our world as some sort of Easter egg.**



2) In ""Castle Story - Gameplay demostration 2"" Germain is showing a widely open gate into the castle, he says it would be easier to defend if it had doors, but unfortunately it hasn't. So I wondered: Like every traditional castle you see those Iron gates or wooden gates with chain on, there can be lifted up so the gate is closed (sorry if it's confusing, Im doing my very best to discribe this) will such gates be added?

**2)We plan on adding fence gates, draw bridges and bigger doors in the final game. For now we just have small 2X3 doors and that's why Germain said that the main gate was would have been easier to defend with a door.**


3) Will players at some point in the development be able to see through the walls in the castle tower (similar in Sims games, where the outer wall is invisible and the background wall isn't.) so you could be able to follow your bricktrons inside the towers/castle. that would also open up the oppitunity to more creative work, such as building rooms, halls, etc. to make the life more comfortable for the bricktrons.

**3)We are working on a mechanism to be able to see through walls right now.**



4) Under the fighting mechanism show off, we see a bricktron dies and turn into something similar as the yellow crystals &amp; a bright light is flying around where the bricktron died. Is there something deeper meaning with the bright light, &amp; will the yellow crystals be useful in anyways?

**4)The little orbs are the creatures' vital energy / souls. They will definitely have some important part in the game and so will probable the yellow crystals**


5) Lets say I decide to build a wall, but short after it's done, I find out that I misplaced it. Can I now order my Bricktrons to simply take it down, without demolishing it with explosives, and be able to use the blocks again?

**5)You will also have ways to detach blocs without dynamite.**


6) While François is showing the fighting mechanism, we see the enemy hit several times on the Bricktrons shield and then dies of it. But isn't the meaning that the shield shall block out damage? so the enemy had to hit the bricktron right on its body?

**6)For now, there are only limited amount of animations and the ""receiving damage"" and ""blocking damage"" animations are the same. It will be clearer in the final game.**


7) How will I get the game? I donated $25 and I waited actually very long time to donate, because I was concerned how I would rechieve my Prototype / BETA. will it be send over e-mail or do you have to log in on Sauropod Studio's website to play? Or will you be able to put it on steam and play it over there?

**7)We will distribute the game digitally and you will receive instructions to download it when it's ready. The game might be on steam one day and if it's the case, you will most likely receive steam keys to be able to play it on steam.**


8) Oh and one more thing: people who donated $15+ will be able to send in there name in the finish game, but how would you response to people there might send in offensive names (this is a possiblity) It would be sad if Castle Story came in miscredit, because of offensive names

**8)We will ask people to respect some standards of decency with their name. We will try to figure out a way to find out the ones that doesn't fit our standards.**


Thank you for let community follow the development of this game! It's very nice for people in the community to be ""let in the warm"" if you can say so &amp; it have been very nice to follow the development of Castle Story, I hope the very best for this game!


You guys problably rechieve thousands of questions, so If you took the time to read this through and answering every question;


Merci!

**Hi Mikkel,**

**We do receive a lot of questions, but answering them in a proper and respectful way is important to us.**

Part I: Moving the camera

You might notice that camera controls are a bit weird. Well, here's how to use them. If you hold down space, and use WASD, you can move the camera forward, back, left, right. By holding down space and right mouse, you can rotate the camera. By using this in conjunction with WASD, you can practically look at everything in the map. When used with space, scrolling zooms in and out. However, using it *without* space moves the camera up and down. Okay, enough with the camera controls, lets learn how to play.

Part II: Playing.

1. Find a nice place to start a castle. I suggest to the left of the starting point on the prototype island, where the land is flat and relatively big.
1. Select your bricktrons by clicking and dragging over them (just like in any other RTS). Move them by right clicking somewhere.
1. Cut down some wood by creating the ""logging"" group at the bottom (you should notice a small axe icon)
1. Now notice the on the right hand side of the screen, there are three icons. Select the top one, and click near some trees (It says click-drag, but that doesn't seem to work).This creates a logging area, and a little blue icon should pop up. Now select your bricktrons and right click the little blue icon. They should get to work cutting down trees. Some logs may fall off the island. That is OK. If your bricktrons do not pick up the logs, it is because you clicked on a tree, not the blue icon. Select them and right click it. 
1. Use these logs to create stockpiles. Create around 10 stock piles by creating the ""build"" group. Again, on the right hand side of the screen there will be various icons with blocks. Select the ""stockpile"" one. It should be the third from the bottom. Notice a blue flat square appears under your cursor. Select some flat land and place 10 of these adjacent to each other.
1. Now it is time to make a mine. Make a ""mine"" group at the bottom, and select the top icon on the right. Find an area that is good for mining, and click. Make a rectangle by clicking again to select another point. Now it will give the option for depth. DO NOT MAKE IT SO DEEP THAT IT GOES OFF THE ISLAND. Now select some bricktrons and right click the icon that popped up. They should begin to mine. They will transport their goods to the stockpiles. Eventually, with enough rubble, a stockpile will turn into stone blocks. Once all your stockpiles are filled, you can begin to make your castle.
1. If you go back to the build group, you can right click anywhere, and a rotational menu comes up. This can be used to select basic blocks to create your castle. Select the ""Standard"" block, and start clicking to place phantom blocks. Right click to rotate a block. But wait! Your bricktrons aren't doing anything. Cancel the tool by holding right click and selecting cancel. Now select some bricktrons (not all of them, some should still be mining) and right click any phantom block. They should begin to build. Remember, bricktrons need stairs to go up levels when they are carrying blocks!

Part III: Things to avoid

Don't have a bricktron in a space when another bricktron places a block there. This will glitch it out, and the bricktron will be stuck.

Part IV: Tips

You can cancel placing blocks by holding right click and moving the mouse down over ""back"" in the radial menu (works with Win7, not sure about OSX)
You can chop down specific trees by right clicking them with a bricktron selected. You can also increase the size of a logging area by going to the sword tab in the menu in the top left corner (thanks Grygon!)
To delete blocks or blueprints, hold down shift when you have the block placement tool selected. Click on blocks.

To obtain new bricktrons, bring a barrel to the center crystal (to get a bricktron to carry it, right click the barrel when you have a bricktron selected). You can also load a saved game, but that, IMO, is cheating :)

This concludes the tutorial I can give you right now. ~~Since the download was release not even 2 hours ago,~~ I don't even know everything about the gameplay.

""It is handled on the Humble Store system. When we release the prototype you will receive an email containing one link for your own usage and multiple other ones corresponding to the gifts. **The people who receive gifts will have to first register themselves on Humble Store, then they will have access to the download link.** But they will be given a serial number too and they will be able to register on our database with that. ""


If you don't have an account at HumbleBundle, you might want to take the time to do so.  **You might think you have one and actually do not.** I say this because you don't need an account to *buy* a Humble Bundle. I discovered this myself today when going to their site (though I've previously bought humble bundles.) So take a few minutes to make sure you're good to go before the prototype is released.


**Edit:**

You know, I think I may be mistaken about this now that I re-read everything. This was the answer to the question ""How are the gifts handled?""  and I was operating under the assumption these are all ""Gifts"" from contributing to Kickstarter.  I guess we'll find out tomorrow either way.

I'm sick of all the coddling Sauropod gets.,93,35,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/1k46kx/might_as_well_make_my_opinion_known_to_everyone/,"This is basically a response to a line of comments that you likely won't see because I was being an asshole initially and got downvoted pretty much to oblivion. Anyhow I digress....

The coddling towards Sauropod isn't helping anyone, they could use a little bit of criticism to help get their asses in gear, when you look at similar situations of a small team, working on an independent game, even using the same engine Sauropod is lightyears behind. Kerbal Space program is an excellent example of this, two years ago there was Kerban, the Mun hadn't been released, basically you could try and orbit around Kerban and that was it, now KSP has a whole solar system with planets all with different physical aspects and Extra Vehicular Activities as well as different types of vehicles and scenarios. I know it's not exactly the same timeframe, but in a year Castlestory has given us...drum roll... A radial menu and slightly better but still broken AI pathing.

I'm just saying that all the posts saying ""You guys are doing fine don't worry about time"" aren't helping, they're basically saying ""It's fine that you guys are way over your deadlines and on track for not releasing the game at all"". Coddling is not a helpful thing, if someone goes on to believe that they can't make a mistake and that everything they do is great no matter what, they turn out to be a pretty shitty person, that's how things work in the real world.
Granted kickstarter funding is a new thing, but they essentially don't have a publisher or anyone they're working for other than us, so really who is going to tell them that they're behind schedule other than us? Heck, I'm pretty sure if they had tried to get someone to publish their game initially they would have looked at the way they've progressed and said ""Nope, we'd prefer to support a team that's actually going to get things done on time.
It's hard to look across this subreddit and just see a whole bunch of people with their noses so brown from all the ass kissing they do, all the people who express criticism have been scared off of posting by the worst of the brown noses, and yet many of them just lurk, you can see that in the fact that when I said the next update was going to be a disappointment in the thread saying that everyone would be getting the update regardless of if they were a kickstarter backer or not, is upvoted more than it is downvoted.

Anyhow, I'm still in the subreddit because one day I would actually like to see the game released and do actually enjoy seeing all the dev diary posts when they pop up on my front page, I guess I just need to stop clicking into the comments section and seeing all the ass kissing happening.",,False,self,t5_2tb9e,False,,bricktron,True,t3_1k46kx,http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/1k46kx/might_as_well_make_my_opinion_known_to_everyone/,

I think it's not a secret, everyone know that any of us are profesionnal in the industry, we are still learning how the ''game'' work and sometime we make errors. 

In january if you remember we had a period when we couldn't give any news on the blog due to the lack of time and the lack if info we had at that time. This resulted in getting the community pissed at us because they felt ripped off. I clearly understand why now and that's why we decided to change how they way we handle the blog now. We went from very heavy blog post that took almost a day to write and build to a simplier and faster one. 

Now we keep receiving emails and messages that we still lack communication. We aren't a marketing company and we want to work the most on our time on the developement of the game.   But I think good ideas can come from the community sometime that's why I'm asking you. is there something you would really want us to change? if so, how?

It's easy to criticize without giving any options. What I want now is having ideas and options from the public. I'm sure you have tons of ideas that you could share with us.

This makes some sense in that we don't want to add to the dev's current state of pandemonium by smothering them in our obviously fantastic ideas. So, here are my suggestions:

We could create designated suggestion threads, so that the community would be able to talk about it without flooding front page and scaring away the dev's.

We could Ban suggestion threads entirely for a certain amount of time, until we talk to the dev's and have a better idea of what their planning.

Or, we could do nothing, and see what happens.

I'm happy working for nothing, I understand how these development cycles work, having lead my own indie team before (though, not to the success that you guys have already achieved).

----
* [bricking bricktrons](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11uvxi/how_to_brick_your_bricktrons/): interrupting them while holding stuff kills them.
* [creating bricktrons](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11p6w8/psa_new_bricktrons_can_be_legitimately_obtained/): blue crystals are collected over the course of standard mining, and can be deposited in barrels. carry these to the big center crystal and voila =P

----
* when you have a lumber/mining group selected, click the sword in the upper left selection pane - you can then change the size or depth of your lumber area/mine
* [mine with tunnels](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11r92e/protip_use_tunnels_instead_of_vertical_mines_they/): these are awesome. click the little tabs at the walls of the tunnel (they turn green) and pull to extend your mine/tunnel
* you can tell stockpiles to accept only wood or stone if you want to keep things tidy. 

----
* right click to rotate pieces, hold right click for a quick building pane (in build mode). sometimes when i can't get pieces to align (ex. planks), you can forcibly stick it to overlap an existing piece (it turns red) and then rotate it out until it faces where you want
* hold shift, and highlight a block to delete it. appears to have to be the same size piece selected. this also works with dirt/landscape! you can slowly build stairs up the side of a cliff this way.
* hit 'delete' key to erase debris. you can also collect it with bricktrons the same as for mining. 
* certain pieces have rules for where they can be placed. still trying to figure this out x.x

----
* [building large wooden floors](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11pr4e/tutorial_building_large_elevated_floors/): very useful for castle interiors. i like to put catapults on top xD
* [staircases](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11ol4z/spiral_staircases_for_those_high_up_places/): i have to try encasing this sometime to make it look prettier, but the staircase itself is very smooth. 
* [bridges](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11pmqg/building_bridges/): building to a higher island is relatively easy, but im not sure how to build to a lower one. still messing around with this. 
* [catapults](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11oksw/how_to_fire_catapult_with_pics/): because its not fun to build things unless you can destroy it too =P
* sample castles: [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11t6al/mountaintop_castle_full_album_in_comments/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11u2ec/im_pretty_happy_with_this_start/), [3] (http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11vizl/6_hours_of_careful_building_before_the_ai_finally/) 

----
[this is as far as i've come so far](http://i.imgur.com/EcC4x.jpg). any input is appreciated! i tried to make a spiral staircase turn to the side, and failed. but it ended up connecting perfectly to my attempts at a raised floor. i'll pretend it was planned =P

current problems i have:

* load/save doesn't seem to work, so i restart every time lol. 
* in the raised floors, not sure how to put crossbars higher up. i've been putting stairs to help the bricktrons get some height up, and demolishing them afterwards (you can see two in my pic still). 
* putting barrels down sinks them into the floor for some reason. 
* i'm still trying to figure out the most efficient way to put staircases down when building a high wall, although you could be [as lazy as me](http://i.imgur.com/D24YP.jpg) xD

also, add more tips if you think its important! i'd like to learn more haha.",,False,self,t5_2tb9e,False,,bricktron,True,t3_11wexv,http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/11wexv/summary_of_things_discovered_recently/,

I feel this kind of humour could greatly benefit Castle Story. 

Giving your little Bricktron dudes some character and emotions could go such a long way into making them more fun to interact with. Having them need food, rest and diversions (Tavern?) could open whole new levels of fun and shenanigans. Imagine one of those poor guys being set on fire, and see him running about aimlessly, arms flailing in feeble attempts to put himself out. Cute little screams could enhance this effect. Imagine the dudes getting into drunken brawls when consuming beverages from the tavern. One of the dudes could be all alone in the dark, he could be shivering in fear, being slightly paranoid (glancing left and right nervously).

All these emotions and needs allows you as the player to feel a sense of maternal protectiveness that compels you to help them when they are in need (or if you're a devious bastard, put them in dire situations on a regular basis).

Also, being able to dig underground and line the cavern walls with brick re-enforcements, permitting underground fortresses would also be cool! Training dummies, archery targets, traps and other neat little things would all add depth to the game.

This game looks good, don't ruin it by focusing too much attention towards it. This is what happened to Minecraft, it got too popular too fast and the developer didn't have time to focus it into a completely solid game. I'm not saying Minecraft is bad, just that it's not very focused in the directions it took with each update.

And everyone on this forum just happens to be a game developer and knows the situation well enough to throw in an opinion as to why the developers here pretty much suck. Oh yeah? Well lets look at the facts Mr/Ms ""Professionals"". 

They only wanted $80k to fund a game. Think about that for a second. No really, *think about that*. This is really the only thing you actually need to know. This alone explains and reveals everything as to why this is ""taking so long"". 

Not only that, but they're a brand freaking new company with no prior experiences. This is all new to them. *Shit happens*. And costs, especially when you're new, [add up incredibly quickly](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/1k46kx/might_as_well_make_my_opinion_known_to_everyone/cblcx4t?context=3). I mean, again, what are you seriously expecting here? 

Now a lot of people are saying that other developers are better or are putting in more effort, etc. Obviously Sauropod *aren't those developers*. Could they be going faster? Maybe, but again, were you seriously expecting this to begin with?? No, seriously now. Were you actually expecting these guys to pump this thing out all lickedy split like? *Why would you even think that.* 

They're taking too long? Get the fuck over it. ALL OF THE SIGNS are right there smacking you in the face. What the hell were you expecting?? If you didn't know that it was going to take a couple years, then your ignorance isn't their problem. 

Chill the fuck out. Your toxic bullshit isn't helping anyone or anything. They aren't other developers, they never wanted to produce the game as quick as humanely possible, etc. YOU gave them money expecting more than that? That's your own damn fault. 

I'm unsubscribing from this bullshit. It's no wonder the devs barely even pay attention to this subreddit, if even at all as of late.

2. A way to turn off the camera shake (the game becomes completely unplayable and I keep finding myself having to turn on the debug menu to be able to DELETE the debris to calm it down).  

3.  A way to turn off the crystal (Sometimes I don't want any more bricktrons and would just like to be able to move my barrels/crystals past it without them being absorbed)

4.  More complex building blocks (a 3-long block, a flat 4 block, both L-shaped inside and outside corner arches) *[yes, I'm sure there will be more building options implemented eventually.  this one is just impatience on my part]*

5.  A better way to bridge gaps.  I remember someone mentioned a crane sometime back... OMG I would love this.

6.  A way to replant or regrow trees.

7.  Fluids...  water or lava.  I love the added complication that these would bring, needing to divert or control the flow in order to build things the way I want.

* Have seen a few people talking about a transporter class. Personally, I think it's a great idea, and also a great way to use wood. How? Wheel barrows and carts.

* A population cap that can be expanded. I know personally I'm getting kind of tired of having ten thousand bricktrons that don't have a use.

* Upped ""party"" sizes. 12 is nice, but a solid 15 or 20 sounds good to me.

* Better pathing. I like the way the bricktrons will pass items along in a chain if they're in the same group. That's an amazing idea. But, when 2 bricktrons from separate groups who are building something they can bump in to one another and get stuck. (I assume they're working on this, as it *IS* prototype/ pre-alpha.

* Another use for wood, and this was one of my main things. I've been using big custom maps like Kingdom and the like, where there is tons of trees. I'd like to see, when digging mines, the mine shaft auto build support struts periodically. (The mine at a certain depth, when collapse is near should have one of it's bricktrons go grab some wood and toss up a support.

I say this because with the terrain generator, certain islands can spawn very far away, and I imagine it will be very difficult to build bridges if you're stuck on a lone island. The solution is simple, transportation, such as airships, would be very handy, it would also be interesting if you could ""assemble"" your own airships to match your kingdom, perhaps even add custom flags/emblems/names to the ships. And as said, on the topic of transportation, do you think there will be any other forms of transport, such as a type of mount for the bricktrons, maybe a cart, or minecarts? Mounts with carriages would be acceptable as they would add a pretty cool experience in siege warfare, same with airships. The airships could be used for many things, from scouting and trading, to planning complicated sieges such as adding explosives to the ship and ramming it into the enemy fort, and at the same time possibly killing some of your men, if the enemy does not shoot/board your ship fast enough.

How effective will a Moat be?,35,9,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/106wug/castle_ideas_how_effective_will_a_moat_be/,"So i've been tinkering with the Idea of using a moat on my castles. For one to dig out stone and or dirt (they said they were considering giving dirt an option to flatten out terrain). Of course the Moat would not neceserally be filled with water. Would be awesome if it could be done, but wouldn't need to have it. 

It would force the enemy to focus on point of attack and you can easely create a bottleneck with a bridge and archers shooting down into said bottleneck, while if you have gates, the walls themselves could potentially act as 'shields' for the attacking enemies. (of course there are Castle designs able to avoid this problem. )

As a person who lives in Europe and has seen a gigantic Moat&amp;Ramparts design made to avoid invaders even if they attempt to get through the moat I know how to create bottlenecks in your castle which make defending easier. But here's my question to you. How effective do you think a moat around your castle would be?

Edit: After reading some of the feedback here, I decided to make an account on the official forum and see if they have anticipateed anything along the lines of maots being created by players.

So you could either build your castle near the lake, or build an aqueduct that leads to your castle. There could also be an option for bricktrons to carry water from the lake to the castle. Building an aqueduct would be very resource heavy, but pay off because you wouldn't need any bricktrons to carry water and you would have a continuous supply. This would stay true to the game because you have to build the aqueduct brick by brick.  I think lakes should have infinite water, but i'm not sure. And about hunger, maybe you would need to clear large portions of land, and fertilize the soil. Or you could create a ranch and raise animals. These elements would also add more combat, because maybe every now and then some of those rock creatures from the trailer will attack the aqueduct, leaving the castle without water.

I want to have an open discussion with you all about the way blueprints and building mechanics in this game currently work. Mostly I want to discuss:

* What works?
* What doesnt?
* What could make this easier or more fluid?

Obvious AI and bug issues aside, I want to discuss the amount of time/effort that goes into building versus the end result and how all that might effect the way we would play considering possible adversaries (such as corruptrons or possibly some where down the line enemy players).

I have had, on my mind, a concern regarding entity collision. Mainly, how it seems like a lot of the time it takes for a bricktron to get from Point A to Point B depends a lot on other bricktrons (what they are planning to do and where they are currently positioned). If too many bricktrons try to build a tower with a simple staircase, we end up with a group of bricktrons staring at each other while we wait for them to pass the brick (if the other bricktron isn't holding something).  

So, with that in mind, what if collision was disabled (for allied unit entities only)? Would they be able to build and gather faster?

And will there be default designs?  ,28,8,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/xdz5z/castle_building_skill_how_important_will_it_be/,"Hey, I was wondering how important it will be to be a talented castle designer.  

Personally, it is this aspect that I think makes the game entertaining.  Nevertheless, I assume that there are those who will be more interested in other aspects of the game.  

If I send hours making an intricate and beautiful castle, will it be more effective than someone who makes 4 walls and some battlements?  For example, it was determined that round or octagonal towers withstood attack by siege engines better than square towers.  Do we have the option to build such rounded towers, and will it have an effect on the strength of our castle?  What about double thickness walls, multiple curtain wall, etc?  

I wonder if there will be default designs that can be superimposed to speed up the brick by brick design process?  

For example, once I frame out a room, it would be nice if the AI could let me default to a tower of X height.  I love the idea f castle designing, but the idea of laying every single brick one at a time seems like it could get tedious after much repeated gameplay...

So I am very excited, but please take your time. I have Guild Wars 2 in 3 weeks to keep me busy, so really, take your time. ;3

Anyways, I was very happy to see multiplayer will be a feature to be done with the complete game (And maybe even available in beta!) And I have a few suggestions for multiplayer modes.

**Sandbox MP**: Basically a no-goals game with no 'win' objectives. Players can do what they like, help or hinder the other kingdoms. Like Civ, but again, with no win conditions. Everything else should also be enabled, NPC and monster raids, disasters and nasty weather, or whatever things you plan on doing with the game to make random events both interesting and 'FUN'.

**Persistent World PvP**:  Have you ever played one of those old school Play By E-Mail games where you set up a queue of commands that takes hours to complete, but you set them up in such a way that you can easily get 8+ hours of things done, and then you log out and come back later and do more stuff?  Now, I'm not saying to make mining and everything take a whole day to do, but I'm just saying that to give you a general idea of where I'm headed. Games like 10Six, or Time of Defiance, you know?  Anyways, how I'd set it up, is that while the game speed progresses at a normal pace, if you leave your base, you lose the ability to directly control your troops and they act following generalized commands at your request like typical Dwarf Fortress.  If you attack other players, they do the same thing. And if you become under siege by another player, both the defending and attacking players get kicked to this AI.  To help facilitate this, you could set up each of your troops to have pre-set places where they should be during an attack, like they planed out their roles during fire-drills. ""If we become under siege, I need to grab my bow and head to the battlements"".  ALL of this would be to support multi-session play....  

Or you could just save the game and quit when everyone is done, and reload it when everyone is back online again, thus eliminating the need for AI controlled siege penalties... I dunno, lol.  ^.^;

**Pure Co-Op**: Double the players with double the randomized event survival trials.

Mainly though, I just want to see lots of cool, randomized events. With a no-goals Multi-player, and let conflict develop dynamically. If players want to fight, they can just do that. If they want to work together, they can do that too.  I would like to see as many events as there are ships in A.I.

As much as I love Minecraft, I really didn't like how they went about development.  They just kind of piled on more and more features without refining them and working out all the bugs first.  This resulted in rather messy updates with notorious bugs that still exist in the current version.  A really good example of this is pistons.  Sure, they're cool and all, but if they worked on a modding API and code optimization rather than cramming popular mods in to the vanilla game, it would have resulted in much stabler updates.  They then could have pistons as an official mod.  The most recent update is a good example as well.  Instead of fixing the lighting bug and adding the modding API, they added temples, trading, and a plethora of new blocks that don't add all that much to the overall experience.  The fact that they're still adding things makes it feel like a perpetual Beta, which is quite cumbersome for modders and server admins.

But enough about Minecraft, this is about Castle Story.

Instead of ignoring the mistakes of past, let's learn from them.  Here's what I would like to see form the makers of Castle Story before the final release:

* An official modding API.  As with almost any game, players will want to add tons of mods, so an official API early on will make it easier for both mod makers and users.  Possibly, later on, have a built-in mod manager for increased ease for the player.

* A mulitplayer mode as stable as singleplayer (should they implement it).

* Flawless (or near flawless) implementation of the basic mechanics (castle building, path finding, etc.) before the fancy stuff (like special building blocks, fancy decorations, etc.).

* If the game is to have a story (or story mode), don't leave us without a defined lore of the world.  I see they want to have magic play a big part of the world, and I'd like to see that lore expanded on.

* A full and filled out soundscape.  I'm much less worried about this, however I'm mentioning it because it's probably the biggest problem I have with Minecraft.

So, what do you think?  What would you like to see while the game's still under development?",,False,self,t5_2tb9e,1343861231.0,,,True,t3_xj48u,http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/xj48u/a_few_thoughts_on_the_development_process/,

1. Suggestions should be treated as they are.  I hate nothing more than when an author/ game developer/ creator of culture sells out either under pressure from the fans, or from the promise of a fat check.  If you fellows from Sauropod Studios read this, PLEASE DISREGARD SUGGESTIONS IF THEY DO NOT FOLLOW WHAT YOU BELIEVE TO BE THE HEART OF YOUR GAME.  If I really wanted to play my game, I would go out and learn C++ or something.  If I'm playing something made by you, I want all of it to fit.

2. This thread is for very thought out suggestions.  Posts should be about advancing the game mechanics or features in a very specific manner.  Please do not post unless you have a clear idea.  Additionally, if you feel that you have a means to improve a suggestion posted, please share.

With that said, off to my idea.  As soon as I heard, ""defend your castle,"" I thought of siege weapons.  Having been a few hours now, and after putting much thought into it, I think I have a winning idea.  To construct a siege weapon, you first start out with a pallet similar to the stockpile.  On top of the pallet, you place a blueprint (possible made by a bricktron/research bricktron) that tells your bricktrons to gather materials in a manner similar to the brick making we saw in the first video.  Afterwords, you receive a static weapon.  As of yet, I could only think of 4 siege weapons and 2 siege engines (ballista, catapult, trebuchet, cannon; tower, battering ram), but I'm sure more could be added if necessarily.  Now then, each of these would have three different levels; a light version that could be moved whole by two bricktrons or disassembled and carried by just one, a medium version that could be disassembled and carried by two bricktrons, and a heavy version that could be disassembled and carried by 3 bricktrons.  Now then, each weapon would have to be given time to properly assemble it before it could be used, and time is of the essence in battle, so we are offered the ability to craft a chassis as well.  There would be three standard chassis able to carry their respective sizes, and each one would have to be pushed by the same number of bricktrons, but the chassis offers a given sieve weapon to automatically convert from mobile mode to combat mode.  In terms of fighting with each weapon, it would take an amount of bricktrons equal to a weapons level to operate it with the option to assign additional members to each crew (taking the crew to 150% rounding up) in order to increase rate of fire.  Additionally, the weapon (and chassis if applicable) should have their own independent health and durability stats.  This would make it possible to either target the bricktron operators or the weapon itself thus offering greater battlefield strategies.  Also, all siege weapons should be considered neutral when not manned, thus allowing one to pick off the bricktrons from a weapon and proceed to use it yourself. The addition of the durability stat would generally decrease each time a siege weapon was reassembled (providing more reason to build a chassis) and after each use allowing the defenders some respite as the operators repair any damages (both in HP and durability) and to account for the concept of ammunition.

With that, I think i have offered all that I believe that i can on this subject.  In the time that i have written this, I have had a few errant ideas, such as having chassis with better protection of bricktrons from ranged attacks and chassis that allow for more than one weapon.  Additionally, I have thought of having a third aspect of a ""Utility Improvement"" that one could attach to a weapon to increase damage, range, rate of fire, necessary operators, movement speed, etc. That's about it.

TL;DR if you need a ""tl;dr"" then find another post, this one encourages word walls",,False,self,t5_2tb9e,False,,bricktron,True,t3_o3yzj,http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/o3yzj/extremely_fleshed_out_suggestions_to_the/,

I totally appreciate and have supported the project on Kickstarter, so I'm sorry to be a negative Nancy here.

The process by which you spawn new Bricktrons is okay but collecting magic crystals in barrels, carrying the barrel to a bigger magic crystal and spawning a new bricktron feels pretty arbitrary and so disconnected from the rest of the experience.

I wish spawning new bricktrons felt more organic. Like, if new bricktrons were chiseled out of bricks or were dug up from the mines it would fit into the natural flow of gameplay and feel specific to the Bricktron's lives. Harvesting ""magic crystals"" seems generic, derivative and tacked on to me.

From reading comments in the latest dev diary, it sounds like there won't be an alpha version of the game at all, but instead go straight to beta. If that's the case, then I paid 10usd more than necessary for the game and won't be cruisy about that. (I won't be a dick about it, but I won't be happy.)

So - is it true, or are people confused? Keep in mind that I'm not complaining about the time frame, which seems to be what most people are complaining about.",,False,self,t5_2tb9e,False,,,True,t3_101yfv,http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/101yfv/will_there_be_an_alpha_or_not/,

I think it'll be great to get people making worlds and sharing them on this forum for everyone to make epic castles with.

However, I don't know about you guys but I've tried using it for the last few hours and have been having quite a difficult time. I'll start off making a large area for my main island, maybe a few smaller islands off to the side. This all works fine but the problem is, when I come to creating any mountains or raised areas on my islands often the whole island gets destroyed, especially when I use the raise land tool. So I gave up on that tool and tried to create raised areas by scrolling to a higher level and creating plateaus then using the smooth tool to make them look more like hills/mountains. I again encountered problems with this, mainly the whole island being destroyed.

Not only is this frustrating but also very taxing for my computer: Destroying a large island results in many, many of those broken block peices being created which can be got rid of with the 'del' key but only after a good 5 mins of lag.


Is anybody else having problems like this? Or does somebody know how to correctly use the world editor? If so, would you be kind enough to write a breif tutorial (or perhaps a video) to help with this?

The reason I ask is that people are suggesting additions to the Prototype when it may not even be relevant. I have a feeling that they're just gonna iron out a couple of bugs in the Prototype and then get onto the actual game separately.

I originally suggested that the ""Story"" part be cut out and changed with something else, perhaps even the rename the entire game.

Whilst I appreciate that the developers are pouring the very essence of their hearts and souls into making this game a reality, I don't want them to have it fail miserably or be torn apart. ""Why?"", might you ask, would this occur?

Quite simply, as [icanhasheadache](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/o2q5m/two_of_my_friends_have_been_working_on_a_game/c3dyoim) put it, the name is too similar to others. The archetypal Blank_Story and Blank_Craft has been excessively used, and does not differentiate the game at all, when clearly, something like this should be heralded as a fresh take on games in an age of stale, stagnating, recycled garbage in the gaming industry...not naming any in particular.

Furthermore, not only will the game not stand out in that regard, it could also be seen as infringing upon intellectual property, or, put simply, trying to gain popularity as a spin-off of similar named games. We all know this can happen a lot easier than originally expected. Remember Final Combat vs TF2? Besides, the last thing you want as an indie developer is a lawsuit on your hands, from ""stealing"" creative license. Yes, I am referencing Notch's legal case with Bethesda, in Scrolls vs The Elder Scrolls.

My suggestion for the community that has rapidly accumulated around this great project, is to come up with alternative titles for this game, that could help make it even more popular and reach a wider audience. I hope you all understand that I'm not trying to nitpick here, but promote a fantastic opportunity to make a wonderful game exceed every expectation of it, and more.

As a starter for discussion, I thought up some quick alternatives for the game, please feel free to obliterate my ideas, so long as you have your own to back them up.

* Sequester (meaning to insulate/isolate)

* Citadelis (slight corruption of Cidatel, but quite chic nonetheless

* Haven (safe place)

* Enclave (effectively, an island surrounded by something else. IE. a country by another country)


Thank you for your patience.

1. **A ground leveling mechanism.**  The game has very gradual gradients in some areas,  and it makes the base of structures a bit sloppy.  If we could create flat plots of land to build our foundations on (much like what happens in real world construction) it would be very nice.

 First of all, you need to find a good spot to mine and build. I chose the area to the direct left of the spawn. Next, you need to chop down a tree by choosing a tron and right clicking on a tree. Now click the circle in the bottom left of the screen, and drag a Bricktron into the build tab on the bottom marked by a hammer. 
When you've done this, chose a stockpile from the build menu on the right and place it somewhere. The Bricktron you assigned to the build tab should build the stockpile, it will look like a wood platform.
Now you have to get a mine started. Assign 3 bricktrons to the mining tab at the bottom, then use the create a mine button on the right side of the screen. Choose the size of your mine and the Bricktrons should start mining. It would be a good idea to add another stockpile or 2.
You are now free to start designing buildings with the build tab.ake sure to manually chop down a tree if you need wood because the ""select area to cut down trees"" function isn't working atm.

We will become part of each other. We will...

Posted by Sauropod Studio

(this update has also been posted in our blog, click [here](http://www.sauropodstudio.com/kickstarter-diary-number-one/) to read the original)

I'm making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS!

Ahem, yeah... 

We don't really know where to start. We were preparing for a long, grueling campaign in which we'd have to fight for every dollar, while in fact it went down pretty much like [this](http://youtu.be/nG_Nwp0wZc0?t=1m), over before it even started. But now that we look back on how we did things, the long grueling campaign was in fact the three months we spent painstakingly creating the trailer, and filling in the paperwork in order to sign up for Amazon Payments. And boy was it worth it!

But it's not over! In fact, it's barely begun. We still have 27 days to go. We have a lot to do to make up for your outstanding and frankly humbling generosity, but let's start by saying:


[(full sized picture here)](http://www.sauropodstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ThankYou.jpg)

The mood here at Sauropod Studio is incredible. A mix of awe and relief. It's that kind of feeling you get when you work really hard on something, taking the long way around just because you want to do it right, and then somehow you're rewarded for all that work. We have a truckload of ideas for new reward tiers, nothing is set in stone, but we're going to announce some of them really soon. 

In the meantime, We'd like to announce some of the new things we're going to do with the extra funding. The 80,000$ we had put in as our goal was really just the bare minimum to keep going for a few months more intil a beta release. But now that we have exceeded that goal, here's a few things we plan on doing in the near future:

We've contacted an amazing artist to help out with the posters. Germain had originally planned to paint them himself, but now we can work together with the artist to make the posters much, much more impressive. We really can't wait to see how that turns out! 
We would like to hire a professional sound engineer to help us with the ambience of the game. We realize that music is important, but is just a part of the whole audio soundscape. Having a strong ambience and intricate sound effects can really help make the game much more immersive. 
We will probably hire Thierry (aka. Menekis) officially as Webmaster and Community Manager. He could also even help with the multiplayer since he has some experience in that. Until now, Thierry has been working as a volunteer for free and putting dozens of hours it the website and the Kickstarter campaing. His help has been invaluable and we are really looking forward compensating him for that. 
Lots more coming in the next days! 
We're going to post some polls soon to see what everyone would like us to do next, so stay tuned! 

Before we go, we've made two sweet little desktop wallpapers for those of you who enjoyed the t-shirts we made:

 It would be a food system that causes you to get more characters.

This is how it would work.
1) A player would order a food source square to be made
2) Once it was ready to be harvested the player would order it to be harvested for one food resource

I'm not going to be necessarily nice about this, and I think it's about time someone stands up and say something like this.


Ever since the huge success of Minecraft, there are so many indie developers ""trying"" to be like Mojang, whether it's how they deliver the product or the contents of the product, and I should have been more careful before I got on the bandwagon of /r/gaming post and made contribution.

I have not been checking the daily progress on this game, but I do check once in a while, there were things really made me upset.

1. for a moment, the studio went silent for a month or so (no news, no updates)
2. for a moment, Sauropod was working on making goods for people who contributed more than many others did and made that act as if that was something that was keeping the company busy.
3. most recently, I've noticed that the studio is working on distribution system (going to be steam, pretty obviously)

none of above, I don't think was pushing the game development any further. For a moment, I was thinking this is just one of those ""projects"" people do, crowd sourcing, and doesn't really make anything out of it. And, now I kind of see if there is even anything that's pushing the developers to complete the game. Kickstarter due dates are way overdue, and I don't know if there are even any reasons for Sauropod to deliver anything to anyone. ""We will deliver when it's done"" ""coding takes longer than you think it does"" kind of responses doesn't seem to show the enthusiasm of the developers.

Honestly, I wonder if the whole distribution stuff is that important at this point. Let's face it, game is not even done. and already talking about how this will be delivered? Can't the game just be on the front page of the web site? Is it really important to keep the non-paid potential user away? Was there not enough money from kickstarter? Is putting the not finished game on Steam THAT important at this point?

I feel like I'm standing in the line for roller coaster (just like in roller coaster tycoon) and been given some side attractions like blog/forum updates, posting ""look what we've gotten (with your money)."" I don't know the entire demographics of the backers or fans, I think it reached the point where adding more Entertainer doesn't really make the long waited guest happier.

I'm not ranting here because I'm feeling like I've wasted money on a indie game development. I'm ranting because I expect more from Sauropod. I remember Fez took FOREVER to come out and Phil Fish had such a hard time getting it done. But Sauropod shouldn't be having difficulties like Fish was having. There are huge amount of funding, more people, and you guys are working in one of the greatest place in the planet, Canada.

p.s.: What makes Castle Story worth more than Minecraft? 

I don't care whether I get commented from Sauropod or not, but I still think that this game needs to have a deadline so people aren't just waiting it to be done.
