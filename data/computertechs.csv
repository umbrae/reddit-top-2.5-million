**EDIT**: Someone posted this over at [Technibble](http://www.technibble.com/forums/showthread.php?t=37788) where the author of [D7](http://www.foolishit.com/) pretty much immediately noticed the similarities between the two sites - most notably the topic and theme.

I started building up the site after [answering](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/trdvq/it_software_toolbox/c4p2s68) [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/trdvq/it_software_toolbox/) and was checking back with it - adding anything new that cropped up. D7 [cropped](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/trdvq/it_software_toolbox/c4p6oxn) up there and it was also submitted through my site form twice - so I added it in. I did pick up on the similarities and made a note to change the theme (a popular Google provided sites theme) when I was done getting most of the suggestions in.

The Internet hivemind can be extremely judgemental in cases of plagiarism, so this edit almost is a necessity. There's no intention of copying the work of D7's author, and I'll change the theme/contact Foolish IT shortly after this edit to prevent any further confusion.
___

A frequently posted question here and on other related subreddits regards what tools of the trade are out there. There's often a load of good suggestions mixed in with some ""use the search"" comments.

What I have done is start collating everything on a Google Site. It is nowhere near complete but I've got the basics down. I'd love it if you could make some suggestions on what else to include (there's a form on-site) as well as let me know about anything else that could improve the site overall.

There are a lot of lists like this out there, but I intend to keep this one up to date with version changes etc on a weekly basis. You're welcome to subscribe to the news RSS or PM me an email address if you'd prefer to be updated that way.

So without further ado: [The Fix List](http://sites.google.com/site/thefixlist/)

Edit: Good initial feedback, thank you! I'll definitely be keeping this up :)

Edit2: Added a section on initialisation (drivers, custom install discs etc)

So I am a Help Desk Analyst who supports non-managed non-employee laptops.  It's quite confusing.  

And on top of all that, we are just now becoming PCI(Payment Card Industry) compliant for all of our employees and independent contractors.  This requires all people who have our company's laptop and process credit card payments through the company to run a software scan to ensure their computers are fully up to date and non-vulnerable.  

We used to use McAfee as our enterprise antivirus which was fine because it was managed and kept up and running.  But now that we are moving onto Forefront, all of the independent non-employees remain on McAfee until we transition them to Forefront.  

The combination of Windows XP machines with SP2 and McAfee running this PCI compliant scan to detect vulnerabilities often finds SP2 a vulnerability and requires the independent contractor to update to SP3.  However, since McAfee is now unmanaged, it is causing the internet to break on all these contractors that are updating to XP SP3.  It is a known issue with McAfee on XP when a user is upgrading to SP3, something happens to cause the internet to break.

###[Here's the link to the updated zip](http://www.mediafire.com/?jsqdjvosdtqsbjl).

New to the updated zip file is a complete list of the installers (same as below) and these 9 installers:

1. ResophNotes
2. Wunderlist
3. MS Office Viewers
4. HandBrake
5. Plex
6. Skitch
7. Growl
8. Microsoft Office 2007 (Trial)
9. WinRar (Trial)

I have left the [older zip file](http://www.mediafire.com/download/atg03tbuh77i7n3/every-ninite-app-indiv-installers-4-10-13.zip) up in case you don't care about the updated stuff.

The zip includes a total of 17 app installers no longer available on ninite.com - yes they still work. The only discontinued installers that no longer work (AFAIK anyway) are for the Piriform apps (CCleaner, etc.). If you encounter an installer in this zip that no longer works, please drop me a PM and I'll remove it from my next upload.

No real training or schooling for it, just lots and lots of real world hands on experience.  I recently finally went into a partnership working for myself.  Thinking of a boost to advertising and credibility with businesses I decided to look into Certifications for the first time.

I was taking some practice A+ Cert tests and on most of the sites to take the practice test you have to give them some info (Name, Email, Phone). On one of the sites the test consisted of 4 pages, after i went through the first three pages the 4th page wouldn't load so i kept hitting refresh until it loaded. When it gave me my final score it said I didn't answer any questions on page 1-3 and only scored 25% for getting all of page 4 right. So i scrolled through the answers on page 1-3 and manually scored myself to see that I got only one answer wrong.

Well fast forward a few days and the training company calls me and asks me if I want training from them, i explain i was just looking for info on taking the actual test and wanted to try a practice test. I don't think I need training for A+ but may be interested down the line for more advanced tests. The woman gets an attitude and tells me I only scored a 25% on the practice test and it sure sounds like I need training. I explained to her the problems with their website and why it only scored the last page. She asks me what browser I use. I say Chrome. She says ""Oh that's your problem, Chrome isn't a good browser, you should always only use Internet Explorer."" I said, well that right there tells me I never want to be trained by your company in anything. I hung up.

""I haven't been trained on that.""  
  
Listen, while you may think it's fantastic to come in and pull your 50k paycheck because someone showed you a work instruction on how to reboot Windows ten years ago. It means the rest of us have to pick up your shit because you never bothered to learn about Exchange or TCP/IP or Virtualization or Active Directory.  
  
Yes, I understand how to set full access permission on an Information Store, you should too. Remember last week when I showed you, and the week before that, and the week before the week before that? While it's great you think modems and databases running out of MS Access are neat - the rest of us have moved on.  
  
Remember fifteen years ago when you were told that everything was going to be networked in the future and you should make sure you understood basic networking? Well it looks like you didn't do that because you don't seem to understand basic subnetting. While it's great you've picked up Ping from somewhere there is a whole lot more to it than that. Maybe in another ten years you will have mastered Traceroute.
  
Please stop referring to me as Level 2 Support. I never agreed to be your level 2 support, it's just something you made up to make yourself feel better about not fixing anything.

I am a systems technician for a small locally owned IT company, aside from that work description, my work simply consists of being the in-office repair guy when it comes to retail clients, as well as our business clients.

A client of ours had the moneypak virus on their PC, so a tech went out, and without backing up any of the data,  ran all his malware removal tools. The threat was removed, however it decided to do some more damage first. Back at the shop I was tasked to diagnose issue, and implement a solution. I slaved the hard drive to my tech PC and noticed that the file system was now RAW, and attempts at getting to the drive again seemed to be impossible without formatting. 

I replaced the drive into the downed PC, and load up Hirens and take a look at all the tools at my disposal. First thing I loaded up was Mini XP. One of the biggest reasons I can't do without Hirens is because of the bootable live WinXP. From their I launched  Partition Find and Mount. With this I was able to scan the drive and at least see the partition table, and sometimes when I'm lucky, I can mount the partition. In this case however, I was not lucky. 

So looking more in the recovery tools, I tried out TestDisk. This simple program did exactly what I needed. First I used it to scan the entire drive, and from there I was able to access the data and back everything up. It worked flawlessly. Now that I had all the data backed up, I still had time to mess around with TestDisk. 

I don't need to go through the steps because google is better at that then I am, but very easily I was able to rebuild the Partition Table, fix the MBR, and best of all (with a lot of frustrated tinkering) was able to repair the file system, setting it back to NTFS, all without needing to format. 

Made what would usually be a boring day, a lot better.",,False,,t5_2soz7,False,,,True,t3_1dgi9z,http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/1dgi9z/how_hirens_boot_cd_saved_my_ass/,

Thought I'd share it with you all!,43,6,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/12j0dr/i_wrote_a_batch_file_that_automates_installing/,"[Link to the script](http://pastebin.com/rn1jLtSn)

I work in a fairly large office (just over 300 users).  We have 5 Xerox printers/copiers/faxes in the building for the employees to use.  They USED to be set up on a print server, but for whatever reason no one manages it anymore.  This means that all our printers have to be set up locally per machine.  Our business currently has both XP and Windows 7 users (we're in the middle of transitioning), so I wrote this script to work for both.

I host these scripts (and the drivers) on a public share on a file server I manage.  It's a one-click script and requires no additional user input.  While I use this on a file server, it could easily be tailored for usage on a USB drive or whatever.

As for the script itself, it either identifies Windows XP, or it assumes Windows 7.  It IS NOT tailored for Windows Vista (though it could easily be).  If you only work with 7 or XP, then the excess instructions can easily be removed.

After the OS check, the script checks if the printer is already installed by checking for it's name in the registry.  Then it uses a .vbs script bundled with Windows to install the printer's IP port.  Then it installs the print driver from the specified location (I point to a public share, but it could point to a USB drive).  If errors are found, it prints an error message.  Otherwise it prints a success message.

I know that batch scripts aren't the most elegant solution, but they're easy to edit and I still find them very useful.  Let me know what you guys think!",,False,,t5_2soz7,False,,,True,t3_12j0dr,http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/12j0dr/i_wrote_a_batch_file_that_automates_installing/,

Nothing unusual, it's not uncommon for people to come in with computer issues and they're not able to tell me what the problem is. 

Then it gets weird. The guy tells me that my boss (the shop owner) ""upgraded"" his computer a few years ago. 

""Oh yeah, he put $600 in upgrades in it, told me i needed a faster motherboard, more ram cards, we put two hard drives in it, put a faster processor in it, put every card we could fit in to it."" 

The guy clearly has no idea what he's talking about and i can't find his information in our invoice software.  

I get the thing on the bench later that day and pop open the side panel. What i find is a completely stock Compaq Presario with a 2.4ghz Intel Celeron, 512MB DDR, and an 80GB hard drive. Only thing that looks like it's been touched was the optical drive. Someone replaced it at some point and did a terrible job at it. Nothing myself or the shop owner would have done.

I found a minor virus infection on the PC and quoted the guy $100 to clean it up. Not gonna mention the lack of upgrades, i have a feeling he'd accuse me of stealing shit out of the computer or something.

Earlier today i got a call from a guy who bought a used Sony Vaio desktop from me a few weeks ago. He told me the computer started acting up so he put in a windows XP CD and reinstalled windows and now nothing works right. 

When we sell a used computer to someone we give them a set of CD's with the machine, one with whatever version of windows matches the COA and a CD with the drivers for the PC. 

The guy swears up and down that he installed the drivers from the CD and it still doesn't work right. 

He brings the computer in to me and i can clearly see that he never even attempted to install the drivers on the machine. 

All this from a guy who ""knows computers and has reinstalled Windows on hundreds of other PC's"" and ""according to the internet, this computer was plagued with graphics problems""

- douchebag boys who 'swing their underpants below their pants like they just don't care' (ding the laptop casing, smash screens, ""hack"" their computer.. Petty stuff.) /we don't have cmd enabled.
- People like me, a chick who respects them an will only come in bi-monthly with a HUGE issue,
- teachers. 'Hey, is that Ben? Listen,my projector died.' *comes in, gets a tall kid to press the on button*

1359133352.0,31,self.computertechs,179h5n,My best analogies for communicating computer technology to users.,39,8,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/179h5n/my_best_analogies_for_communicating_computer/,"Possibly a bit meta, but I think we, here, deal with this every day. So I'm submitting my 2 best analogies. Other people may already use them, but I came up with them on my own, having to explain things over and over to customers... You can't beat square pegs into round holes, you simply shape the charge into a cylinder and it'll slide right in. Of course, I’m here to share them, so feel free to use them as you will!

So first, how to explain the processor, and the different between memory and storage: **Imagine a worker (the processor), sitting at a desk, with desktop workspace as memory** (make sure and say ""desktop workspace"", lest the user think only of the Windows Desktop), **and a filing cabinet for storage.**

**Processor**: The worker is your processor. As he works on things on the desktop, he occasionally accessed the filing cabinet for other information, but mostly works with what's on the desk. Dual core processor is 2 workers, at a desk, both working in tandem, able to accomplish 2 completely separate tasks at once. Hyperthreading, the worker is double-fisting all that paperwork, most of the time doing almost 2 things at once, but not all the time, and sometimes one task bogs him down. A slower processor is simply a slower worker. Dual core:Dual socket::One desk, 2 workers:2 desks, 2 workers. Cache can even be explained by how much the worker can hold in his hand, without having to put it down on the desk to read it. So much can be explained easily with this analogy! I've gone into chipset particulars once with a customer, the chipset in older computers was the path from the desktop workspace to the filing cabinet and everything else, the processor only really accessed the desktop, and information moved only from filing cabinet to desktop, then from desktop to the worker for reading... Modern computers with more SOC capabilities work less from the chipset - The worker accesses and reads information from the peripherals and the filing cabinet almost directly, and things can be placed onto the desktop workspace from the peripherals and the filing cabinet with only a request by the worker, or even automatically- The worker didn’t have to do the action himself, making the worker’s job move quicker.

**Memory**- This is the desk where the worker gets things done. Having more workspace, more memory, lets him work on more things at once, without constantly have to dig through the filing cabinet. If the user doesn't get it, ask them to recall working on a research project on a massive library table, and then trying to accomplish the same feat on a folding auditorium desk. *That's what 256MB of RAM with Windows XP feels like ;)* Sure, you can take notes... But that's about it. Single/Dual/n-channel memory can be explained using wrap-around / multi-surface desks. Memory speed can be explained easily by attributing this to the speed the worker can read the information on the desk, SDR/DDR/DDR2/etc can be explained using multiples of reading speed, ie ""DDR2 reads twice as fast as DDR"". Bad memory (spotty, causing instability, not posting) is essentially a hole on the desk, where the papers/work keep falling through, or a bad leg on the desk, so when you set it up, it falls over and dumps all the work onto the ground.

**Storage/Hard Drive**- This is the workers filing cabinet. When the worker is low on desktop space, or needs old information, the worker reaches for the filing cabinet, which is MUCH slower to find information and read it than finding and reading the information on the worker's desk. The pagefile is essentially just information organized like it is on the desk, but it's inside the filing cabinet. The worker knows it's there, so it's a little bit faster than accessing any old information from the filing cabinet (loading programs from pagefile: launching from the HDD), but still not as fast as having it already out. Having a failing HDD is like a filing cabinet, with all the information on rails and folders getting jammed, and sometimes when the cabinet is opened, the folders are off the rails, papers slip out, going out of order, becoming messy or lost. Locked out of the HDD (Security passwords!!), lost the key to the filing cabinet.

I’ve squeezed in many other things to this analogy… But I don’t use this analogy unless starting with the &lt;this is the difference between the processor, memory and HDD&gt; bit first, I only continue with the analogy to explain everything else if the customer just keeps asking questions. Most other issues are easily explained on their own. A bad power supply is a power outage. Viruses are make the worker sick, but instead of the worker calling out sick, he tries to do his work, sometime’s he’s able… He could be under instruction by somebody else, he may be feverish and doing things poorly, messing things up (corrupting files). The virus might just be a camera installed overhead, monitoring all which is done, the kind of program on your computer which steals your passwords and logins.

**My second analogy is a quick one** – *“I just had my computer in a week ago, and it’s infected again!! I don’t think you did your job. I’m frustrated, disappointed, constipated, etc…”* This issue occurs at least monthly – I run a small business, I can concentrate on systems easily, and there is little work which gets handed from worker to worker. I make sure all jobs are done from start to finish by one worker, as much as necessary. I explain the problem to pacify the customer this way, “While there is a chance something was missed, those viruses are tricky creatures and can hide in all different places, and some are so new that our tools and scanners can’t even recognize them all the time to eradicate them, it’s also perfectly normal for whatever activity which caused the infection the first time to have continued, causing a separate second infection after we cleaned the first infection completely. **It’s like getting a new tire put on, because your old one had a flat… And on the way home, that new tire gets a flat. Sure, it might be a bad tire. I’m here to take a look and figure that out for you. But you might have run over a screw, sliced it on a curb… And you wouldn’t blame the repairperson for that, would you?**” From that understanding, it’s all blowing smoke until they leave, and you can either identify when the infection came in with date stamps, *or berate your employee for missing “shssadhbd.exe” in the Appdata folder.*

Does anybody else have some nice analogies they use with customers?

Are there any other utilities that are similar that I should be looking at in this same vein, or would I just have to start looking at scripting my own installers at that rate?

Coming here more for ideas and not for help or how to.

- I have funding taken care of. 

- Retail location scouted. 

- Bunch of home depot gift cards left over so I can pick up laminate counters to make benches from.

- Will be picking up Quickbooks to handle the financial portion.

- Worked for custom pc shops before &amp; would love to offer them.

- 2 employees so onsite and in-store services.

- I have six asus 22"" inch screens to hang on the wall with kvm switches.

Will be offering free PC/Laptop recycling (Great way to salvage used parts to sell)

- I have worked for a electronics recycling company. I have had fully working i5 systems dropped off that just had bad ram or almost brand new i3 laptops dropped off with bad screens. These are all free items and pure profit. This also helps with selling used ram, say 2gb sticks of ddr2 for $20 (it sells fast) and cases.

I have a few spare PC's laying around that will work fine for check-in/check-out machines. What type of check in &amp; out system would you guys recommend? Can always do it the old fashioned way with excel. I've seen Spice Works mentioned a few times on here.

* removed his video card
* removed RAM

**TL:DRs at the bottom**
****
**Story 1:** This one happened about 6 years ago when I was doing a malware removal for a customer I no longer do business with. Nothing bad happened, they just haven't called me out in a while. Anyway, the customer had left because he had errands to run. While I was working on removing the virus, one of the customer's relatives started talking to me. 

He was a relatively young male, probably in his mid-late twenties. At first, he was just talking about regular stuff, asking how business was, what I did for fun, etc. At some point, for reasons entirely unknown to me, the conversion shifted to where he started to talked about how he used to deal cocaine. He talked about how he acquired it, and where he sold it. I sat there thinking, ""*Whoa! Why is he telling me all this?*"", but I needed to get the job done, so I keep plugging away. It seemed like it was some sort of catharsis for him to unload all this information onto me. 

As if things couldn't get any more WTF, he started talking about how he would rob illegal migrant workers. He stated that they always kept cash on themselves because they could not get bank accounts. Then, he detailed an incident where he robbed one of them for $5,000. He said that he had robbed the person at gun point, and shot them in the leg when they did not comply with his initial orders. He knew they would not report the incident because of their illegal status.  

Now I'm like, ""*Dude! This is too much!*"", but again, I decided to go on and finish. At no point in the conversation did the individual seem threatening, otherwise I would have left immediately. He even offered to hook me up at one of the clubs he frequented. I politely declined, finished removing the malware, and left post haste. 
****
**Story 2:** This one happened about 3 years ago. I was doing a malware removal for a soldier. He leaves while I'm working because he has errands to run. While I'm working, his wife, also a soldier, comes in to see what I'm doing. 

I tell her that I'm removing the malware from her husband's computer. She then asks where it might have come from. I give her the usual spiel about downloading music, adult content, email attachments, etc. She says, knowing her husband, that it most likely came from adult content. 

This is where things start to get weird. People usually just say, ""Okay. I'll make sure to not do that in the future."", or something to that effect. Her question to me though was, ""Why do guys like to watch porn?"". ""*Oh god.*"" I thought, ""*How am I supposed to deal with this?*"". I lied. I told her that I didn't watch it myself, and had no idea why other guys did it. Next, she said that her husband was not paying as much attention to her anymore, and that she had recently had a mirror installed on the ceiling for her husband's birthday so that they could watch themselves having sex. ""*TMI!*"" I thought.

I already new that I was on Weird Ave., but I had no idea the conversation would take a left turn onto W.T.F. Street. She then proceeds to tell me that she was raped in Iraq, and that the child she was holding was the product of that rape. ""*[W.T.F.!](http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/entries/icons/original/000/005/545/OpoQQ.jpg?1302279173) TMI! TMI!*"" I thought. I did not know how to respond to
that. I just told her that I was sorry to hear that, proceeded to finish the job, and left. 
****
**Story 1 TL;DR:** [Guy tells me that he used to sell cocaine, and rob illegal immigrants at gunpoint.](/spoiler)

**Story 2 TL;DR:** [Woman soldier asks why guys watch porn, says she bought a ceiling mirror so she could watch herself have sex with her husband, and says she had a child from being raped in Iraq.](/spoiler)

I started working at call centres after highschool, had good metrics, found my way into an IT support desk and my boss at that position has now carried me to 4 different companies.  I'm a decent tech if I'm not over stressed and over worked - which rarely happens.

I've been working mainly managed services help desk for &lt;50 companies (tier 1 and 2)  but my last 8 month contract was deskside support.  Something I thought in the beginning I'd love doing!

Now 7 years into IT and I'm completely burnt out after my last deskside support gig.  My manager there was a huge asshole and I didn't fit in with the guys who had been there for years. 

Now I'm back on the desk until my next contract, doing deskside again, but I am so tired of doing this work.


I don't really like it because of how unorganized every company I seem to go to is.

Everything is extremely unorganized, undocumented and I hate how I'm given tasks and issues on critical servers that I have no idea how to manage and there is very little support available.  


I'm honestly just tired of doing this job and I leave work every day with no motivation to sit down and study for more certs, as every day is full of stress, the tickets never end and as a result I am extremely unmotivated to continue my career in IT.

However, I'm stuck because I don't have any idea what else to do and just pulling myself out of debt now.


Anyone in a similar spot or deal with this?

I'm thinking of taking time away from IT and revisiting in 6 months to see if i'm motivated enough to try to get my CCNA... but I hear its hard as heck to even get a networking gig if all you have is your CCNA and no experience.

In this time, I have never found a really good, true go-to driver solution. Yeah, I've found stuff like driver guide and what not, but that site is so frustrating to use, I avoid it like the plague. The manufacturer sites are a huge pain at times, with entire models being missing, or lacking the actual drivers I need. Searching by HID can be even worse, leading me to site after site with no info, no download options, and no real solution.

Basically, I want to change that. But I need help to do it.

Here's a basic rundown of what I want to accomplish:

* A download database containing archive files of drivers by PC model. Double Driver is perfect for this. Everything you need for the machine in one package. As the collection grows, include XP, Vista, 7, 8 drivers in 32 and 64 bit. Linux, too, if there's adequate demand.

* A wiki split into 3 basic categories: HIDs, PC models, and hardware models. A way to link HIDs to hardware names to the model it belongs in. May even expand to include individual device drivers at this point.

* No account required to download. Period. That crap is annoying.

* A forum to make requests, ask questions, etc.

All of this would be community driven. That's a hard one on its own, really. Driving the creation of a community capable of this will be hard. So, some challenges I foresee:

* Costs. I'm broke.

* Website hosting, domain name.

* Reliable download hosting.

* How to design the site. Use a freely available CMS with download db, wiki, and forum features/addons, or hire/convince someone to custom build one for the project.

So, my fellow techs, I ask you. Is this worth doing, and will you help me?

UPDATE (6-11-2013): Another update adding a Hardware tab that looks at Device Manager, and added the feature to output to a text file. You could then add this log file as an attachment to an email and send it to tech support, trying to automate that process would be complicated so I just left it like it is.

UPDATE (6-14-2013): Another update, adding subnet mask and arp connections to the list of information gathered. Also had some cosmetic and behind the scenes changes to threading to hopefully help out some of the sluggishness on some machines. Ideas are definitely still welcome.

The downside is that it encrypted all his files (5 years worth - no backup [big surprise]) and added the .html extension on them (word.doc = word.doc.html).  Opening this file will bring you to the ransomware site where you can pay $300 to decrypt.  Removing the .html extension does not restore the files.  From what I've read this is a true encryption virus and there is no easy way to restore the files.

I tried the te94decrypt.exe app with the ""-k 85"" switch as well as a few others without any luck.  Has anyone had success decrypting these files?  It seems there are decryptors for the .block variant and a few others, but not the .html.

I have no idea where they found this woman but she was the definition of white trash.  About 5 feet tall, 160ish, grocery store bottle blonde, cans to her knees and easily looked 60+.  I work from home so she would happen to be outside to smoke and see me walking from the house to my detached office.  Unlike the neighbors she ALWAYS said hi and was a MASSIVE over-sharer.  Before I had totally remembered her first name she was telling me about going to the hospital for her neck...you know, because of the domestic abuse and all...Lastly, I have been around enough family members with methamphetamine problems to know this lady liked to P.A.R.T.Y. every once in a while.

So she finds out what I do and manages to get a Dell laptop that had to be 8-10 years old in return for ""cleaning a house""...whatever the hell that means.  She tells me she wants me to upgrade it and I give her an estimate for upgrading RAM and the HD.  She says she wants the works but will only be able to give me $50 a week since they only pay her $500 every 2 weeks.  At that point I told her that she needed to save her money and I would order parts as she could pay me to install them.  I went ahead and took the machine to make it workable on the family's wireless network and told her it would be $50 for me to clean the bugs off and throw in a USB wifi dongle I had in storage (I have a soft spot for WT).

A few days later the neighbor's wife calls me and lets me know they are letting her go.  She would miss 6 days a month of work being ""sick"" (wondering how that works out living with your boss...) but would then go out and party during the evening.  The wife who worked full time was having to come home and take care of the rest of her family, then do all the special care stuff her other child required.  Anyways I told her I would bring over the machine since the nurse would be coming by later to pick up the rest of her things.  At that point all I had done was re-install windows with the valid license on the sticker so I just told her not to worry about paying me (again, living amongst WT my whole life I could see this shitstorm brewing a mile out).

Later that night I am home with my family and hear the doorbell ring.  I answer it and the nurse is standing there looking distressed.  She goes on to inform me that my neighbor got a little drunk and tried to come on to her, some of her pain pills were missing and that the family was short changing her so she was forced to quit.  She goes on to say that she would still like me to work on her computer.  Before even formulating a response in my head I said ""I think it might be best if you found someone else"" and slowly closed the door.

Turns out she had just left from threatening to go to the local police department to report her pills being stolen.  They wisely told her to GTFO and talk to their attorney if she had any other concerns.

    It's toward the policies you're required to enforce.

I just had a customer come in that came over from Best Buy for a virus/ransomware removal. No big deal, we both do the same service pretty much for almost the same price. She just came to us because we can do it faster and for $10 less.

After talking to her for a little while, I find this out:

* Geek Squad hooked her computer up on the spot to check it out. (This is actually nice, I didn't think they did that.)

* They loaded up some virus ""checker"" program to scan the computer.

* Made the customer wait around the store for probably a half hour or more, just to say ""yes you have x amount of viruses, it will be 5+ days"".

Why would they do a scan of the drive and made the customer hang around for about a half hour? Anyone that started it up and loaded the desktop could see what it had. Also, if they were running a scan, why couldn't they charge her $25 or something to remove what the quick scan found?

Corporate policies are BS and they piss me off.

Think of RAM like your desk, and the hard-drive like a file cabinet.  It wouldn't be very efficient to try to read and write onto documents without first pulling it out of the file cabinet and placing it on your desk, right?  That's exactly what's happening when a program is 'loading'.

The bigger your desk (the more RAM you have), the more documents you can work on at once.  With a tiny desk, you may have to keep switching out which documents you're using, and as you can imagine, looking through a file cabinet takes some time to find what you're looking for.

Panic! Speaking with her further I learned that this was not unusual behavior and I breathed a sigh of relief but I realised that I will need to be a lot more methodical working with the general public.

Here's my problem: I'm sort of getting bored. Throughout my last two years of college, I was working 20-25 hours a week plus taking classes. At one point in the summer of 2010, I worked 78 days in a row of 8 hour days without a day off. My final semester of college saw me interning 35-50 hours a week, working 15-20 hours a week on campus, taking three classes, and I was VP of my club; I barely had a waking moment where I wasn't busy.  

Although not working *that* much has been a reprieve, I'm kinda getting bored in my free time now. I don't work weekends, I leave work at 4:15 and I'm home by 4:30, and homework doesn't exist. I want to use this time to make some more money, so I figured I should do something worthwhile that could help me advance my career.  

Here's what I'm thinking: since I still leave in my college town, I can start with college students as my target audience; virus remediation and other general repair could be a good place. I just don't know **anything** about starting something like this; what do I need? How much should I charge? etc.

I have always shown significant interest in computers, but it was never my first love. I went to school for Music with focus in Jazz Studies. I did it because i have a genuine love for the trumpet and the lifestyle of a jazz musician and wanted to be able to play the ever-loving snot out of my instrument. Knowing the day would come that this lifestyle simply would not pan out due to it no longer being the 1930s, I chose to jump into the IT field, using my Jazz Studies degree as ""I went to college"" clout. Sure enough it landed me the job that I am currently in. Doing remote support for internal customers of a nation wide truck and trailer parts stores (roughly 250 in the nation) I have been working here for roughly a year, and I honestly don't even feel like the same person anymore.... Day in day out of getting screamed at by redneck idiots.... The first 10 minutes of the phone call is the user trying to figure out the hostname of the computer they are on (there are stickers right on the front of each machine.) And don't get me started when the DNS doesn't work and it won't resolve, then its the hunt to have the users tell me their IP Address by using ipconfig within CMD. Now, don't get me wrong.. The users who are this illiterate and are nice, I have absolutely no problem working with, because in the long run, I know they are actually listening to me and taking my advice... Its the disgruntled assholes who play the blame game that are just ripping me apart, and these callers are the majority of the Userbase. I am starting to find myself clocking out, going home, and just not doing anything... I'll lay on my bed and just not think about anything... Gone are the days of practicing, going out and doing things with friends, anything... I am so mentally and emotionally drained at the end of each day, I just want to pretend to not exist... I want out of this field so bad, but I know i can't afford it.... I don't know where else to turn... So I come to you asking... How can I learn to roll off the customers who yell at me, and not take it personally? How can I calm myself during these phone calls that make me want to punch out the next person I see and/or slam my face into my desk? What relaxation methods can I use? Its getting to the point where playing on street corners for spare change is sound a whole hell of a lot more appealing than dealing with moronic assholes mon-fri.

Thanks for listening guys

TLDR: New to IT, overly angry and frustrated at asshole users, needing a way to calm my nerves in order to make my day job more bearable and thus my whole life in general.


EDIT:
WOW, Thank you all for such wonderful advice!

I think I need to explain our environment a little bit better. 

First of all, we have zero desktop support application.  All installations are done via VNC and in an admin account.  We are currently in the process of deploying LANDesk, but it is failing miserably with our environment.   

Second, as stated, we have some pretty serious DNS issues that our networking team refuses to address.  We are sitting on several different concentrators that are all old, out of date, and are unsupported by each other, thus making it hard to get around without having to do an IP Scan of each branch who calls.  

Thirdly... We have about a 4000 Person userbase, and only 6 guys on the SD and each of us has a lot of individual projects to work on, but there is rarely a time where any of us can get off a call longer than 5 minutes before a another one comes in... Our queues are growing by the day.   
I think this is one of the biggest issues too, Its hard getting yelled at because calls are stacking up, and then 30 minutes later get yelled at because my project hasn't progressed for the day.... Its like, How?  How am I supposed to work on building new images for our new hardware while on the phone with an OpenScan issue that we have little to zero documentation on?  

Which lead me to, Our Knowledge Base.  we have only 250 articles and most of which don't apply anymore due to updated software and hardware.  We are all responsible for keeping it up to date, but how?  Wheres the time?

This is why I come home so stressed out... Getting up to take a PISS is frowned upon...  Its like I have to fucking schedule it on the calender here...  So all of this, on top of dealing with pissed off users?  Yeah... The paycheck doesn't appeal to me much anymore.  I had dental work done today, and I am less stressed out.... 

Dental... Work...

Got a call for a nonworking Dell wireless keyboard on a Dell All-in-One PC from a customer I'll call Sarah. I was told by Sarah that it was working earlier that day and it was not working now. When I arrived on the scene the conversation went something like this:

**Deeperkyo**: Have you tried replacing the batteries?

Sarah: Yes.

**Deeperkyo**: Have you tried re-syncing the keyboard?

Sarah: Yes. It's still didn't work. 

**Deeperkyo**: Have you tried to remove and reinsert the wireless dongle? 

Sarah: What's that?

**Deeperkyo**: It's the piece that goes into your computer that allows your keyboard to communicate with the computer. 

Sarah: Oh that! Yeah! (Points to ****Logitech Unifying dongle****.) It was working earlier today with this. I was changing desks and moved my computer and bent the other one. I went to get a replacement at the store and the man told me that they didn't carry Dell, but I could get a new wireless mouse and that would work with my Dell keyboard. 

**Deeperkyo**: (*But...That's impossible*) Ma'am, that dongle is only made to work with your Logitech mouse. It will not work with your keyboard.

Sarah: It was working this morning!

**Deeperkyo**: Ma'am, if it was working this morning, I have no idea how. (Feigns looking for Logitech software using the Windows OSK to test to see if it did somehow actually work.) Ma'am did you install the Logitech software?

Sarah: No. I just plugged it in and the keyboard and moused worked. Now it doesn't.

**Deeperkyo**: Ma'am I honestly have no idea how you got that to work as they're made by different companies. You'll have to call Dell and get them to send you a new dongle. (Writes down part number of broken dongle.) Just call them and give them the part number, and they should be able to help you out. That's the best I can do.

Sarah: Okay. I'll call them. Thanks for your help. I guess I just have to call them and get a new one.

**Deeperkyo**: No problem. Call me if you need anything else. (*Please don't call me.*)

**TL;DR**: Unifying dongles bring the technology of all the world's wireless devices together. :)
****
Bonus Story - **No Dial Tone; No Problem**

On the same call, Sarah asked me to look at her fax machine because it wasn't sending faxes.

**Deeperkyo**: I need to check the line to see if there's a dial tone. Do you have a regular phone I can use?

Sarah: Yes. Here's one.

**Deeperkyo**: (Plugs phone in. *Dead Silence*) Um. Ma'am. There's no dial tone. There needs to be a dial tone for the fax to send.

Sarah: It was working earlier today!

**Deeperkyo**: (*Super facepalm*) I'll need to find a working line for this to work. (Checks xfinity box. Line 2, which had the fax connected, had no dial tone. Put a three-way on Line 1 and connected the fax and phone line. Used HP text fax service to send a fax.) There you go. That should square you away.

Sarah: Thanks!

**Deeperkyo**: No problem. Have a nice night. (*Have a bad night.*)

Recently, the internet started cutting off for several seconds every few minutes. While it was down, the internet light on the modem changed from green flashing (good) to orange or amber. We did the usual turn all the things off and on again, but it didn't help. An upgrade to a better, gigabit wireless N router did nothing to fix it.

Around the time the trouble started, our power company sent out a guy to install a smart power meter. We didn't realize the correlation, but after asking Verizon to send someone out with a new ONT (unknown acronym -- device to convert fiber into coax for tv and internet plus rj-11 phone line) the guy who showed up told us all about how people have had similar issues when a smart power meter is installed adjacent to an existing ONT, its RF interferes with the ONT, requiring that the ONT be moved away from the meter.

Reddit, I'm a computer technician in Canada, and some clients of mine told me a pretty sad story.

Barbara, a friend of theirs living in Mandeville, Louisiana, has been using the same PC for the last 15 years, and it's finally given up the ghost.  She lives on her own and this is her only link to the world at this point, other than her daughter who visits about once a week.

We want to get her a new PC, probably a laptop.  We figure we can order one from Dell USA, and have it shipped right to her house.  What we need, though, is someone local to her to set it up for her and get her back up and running.  It's a pretty daunting leap from Windows 95 to Windows 7, and we need someone who'll be patient and sympathetic.  She's pretty savvy and an internet aficionado, but at 85 obviously stuff doesn't come quite as quickly.

Reddit, does anyone know a computer technician in the area that might be able to help out?  We can of course pay for their time, but this might be ongoing so we want someone who won't mind swinging by when there is trouble.  We were going to go with the Geek Squad, but they wanted $190 just to have a look, and that's 1/2 of what a computer is worth!

Any ideas?,24,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/1h9jky/raid5_array_failed_client_fessed_up_they_werent/,"Sincerest apologies if this is in the wrong sub-reddit.  Point me in the right direction and I'll be on my way.  The thing is, *I technically am glorified tech-support* so me going to a place where end users troubleshoot their 7yo Inspiron laptop seemed like a less than great idea.

I have a problem with 3 disk, RAID-5 array in a server. The server would not boot and RAID controller showed following status:
 
                DISK       STATUS
                1:0          offline
                1:1          Missing
                1:2          OK
                Array Status: FAILED
 
I powered down, then reseated drives 1 at a time, then:

                DISK       STATUS
                1:0          OK
                1:1          Missing
                1:2          OK
                Array Status: DEGRADED
 
I tried to boot OS, but system didn’t seem to detect system volume.
 
I then booted from a CD and inspected partitions:

                Utility    -- 8MB free of 32MB total
                OS          -- 6GB free of 20GB total
                Data       -- 20GB free of 90GB total

Although, the free space indicates files should be present, no files or folders were visible.
 
The key to predicting the data recovery potential is, of course, is whether drive 1:0 failed first or whether 1:1 failed first.  If 1:1 failed first, then I should be able to rebuild using 1:0 and 1:2.

If 1:0 failed first (and 1:1 failed 2nd) then I will not be able to rebuild the RAID-5 array, unless I can get 1:1 back online.

To make matters worse, the owner of the server revealed that they weren't keeping up with their backup tapes.  Another engineer noticed a week and a half ago that backups were offline and did a backup then so we may be able to restore from that point, but we'd much rather save the data on the HDDs and move on if possible.

Any thoughts? I have some things to try, but just wondered if the fact that I could see the partitions--but not data files and folders--was indicative of recovery potential.

First of all, let me formerly apologize if this is the incorrect subreddit for this sort of thing. I tried looking for a good place for this, especially where it would eventually be seen, and this was the closest I could find!

I'm a 20 year old male residing in New York. I'm currently going to a health &amp; tech institute that provides Information Technology courses. I'm going full time and have already completed a Linux course (discussed how to manage a Linux based system, basic commands in the command line for the OS and a Linux based server, etc) and received an A as a final grade. I'm currently taking now two classes (Mac and Network +). In Mac, we're mostly at the moment learning the GUI, how to troubleshoot the OS at a fairly basic and somewhat advanced level, etc. In Network+, we're learning the seven OSI layers, cable types, how to physically set up a network, how to manage a network, cable management, telecommunications room management, how to cut your own cables, how to set up switches, patch panels, hubs, etc... the whole nine yards. 

I've been with computers most of my life and am very experienced in Crash Dump analysis and debugging for Vista/7 based systems. I decided that I wanted to make computers a bigger part of my life, and ultimately my career. The only problem is, I am not quite sure how the 'real world' in terms of IT and finding jobs works. All I know is, if I graduate, I get three certs paid for by the school granted I pass the exams and then I suppose I go and find a job? I'm sort of foggy on a lot of stuff, so I would appreciate any tips or help.

 These are the included courses I am taking/will take:


   * CompTIA A+
   * Windows 7
   * CompTIA Network +
   * Windows Server 2008
   * Microsoft SQL Server 2008
   * Microsoft Exchange Server 2010
   * Apple Certified Support Professional
   * Microsoft SharePoint 2010
   * ‎Cisco Certified Entry Network Technician
   * ‎Cisco Certified Network Associate
   * Security+
   * Virtualization and Cloud Computing
   * Certified Wireless Technology Specialist

At the end, when I graduate, the institute is providing pay for three certifications. To my knowledge, off of the top of my head, these are the three certs they are paying for: CompTIA A+, CompTIA Network+, CompTIA Security+. To my knowledge, and from what I have read, these certs are entry level certs and can usually get your 'foot right in the door'. Is this the truth, and will it be fairly difficult to find a job, and how would I go about finding one in the first place? What are some good places?

I'm just wondering what's at the end of the tunnel for me with certifications like that. Something I am also very worried about, I don't have a college degree, just a GED. Rather than attending community college or university, I decided to enroll into this program. So, in reality, all I have to my name will be those certifications, a diploma from the school itself, and a GED. Is that enough even for entry level positions, and in the future, higher positions even if I earn more certifications (random example, MSCE... etc)?

1356016762.0,20,self.computertechs,1564ql,Don't waste your time with Crucial M4 SSDs.,31,11,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/1564ql/dont_waste_your_time_with_crucial_m4_ssds/,"Warning: Wall of text.

I'll try to keep this to the point as best I can.  I have purchased 9 Crucial M4 SSDs from Amazon over the last 6 months.  We've steadily replaced all of our traditional HDDs with the 256GB M4.  Performance is great, boot-times are fantastic, it's a night and day difference @ system response.  That's the plus.

We have had 3 of those 9 drives fail prematurely (I'd say 3 of 9 within 6 months is a bit of an issue).  All drives shipped with what was the latest firmware at that time.  So the original customers who had the really nasty bug of drive failing after so many hours of use, was something we had just missed (thankfully).

All of the failed drives (thus far), have been in laptops.  All new Dell Inspiron laptops, 15R and 17R, respectively.  TRIM support is enabled, defrag is disabled, and we've been through all the standard SSD best-practices.

The pattern seems to be related to power, or lack thereof.  All of the Crucial M4 SSDs have failed in laptops that were running on battery power at the time.  I hate to speculate, but that's what appears to be the constant.  It seems that if the systems run out of battery power completely, shit hits the fan.

Whether its NTFS corruption, which chkdsk cannot repair, to [bad blocks](http://i.imgur.com/x8TZE.png), it seems that when the power runs out, it's all over.  Again, I hate to speculate, but that's been our experience thus far.  Their latest firmware update [reflects improvements](http://i.imgur.com/ilEsQ.png) if sudden power loss is experienced.

Crucial, has been anything but supportive.  After the first 3 or 4 emails of them deflecting any possible issue, we finally got to the discussion of RMA.  Their solution, is to [wait-to-receive](http://i.imgur.com/TMk41.png) - i.e. we pull all the drives out, ship them to Crucial, and wait for them to send out replacement, refurbished drives.

They didn't offer to put a hold on a CC to ship one out.

This might just be my own experience, but we support a few hundred systems each week.  We deal with systems on a daily basis.  I have never seen such a high failure rate and there is absolutely no way I would ever put our name on these drives and recommend them to a client.  If you have time to dick-around and enjoy the thrill of ""will my drive fail today!"" then ignore the above.

Just thought I'd share my experience and possibly save someone some time.

**TL;DR** - 6 of 9 Crucial M4 SSDs failed in under 6 months.  Crucial wants to replace with used drives and expects systems to be without hard drives while they wait-to-receive.",,False,,t5_2soz7,False,,,True,t3_1564ql,http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/1564ql/dont_waste_your_time_with_crucial_m4_ssds/,

As far as computers go I've been messing with them since I was a little kid, taking them apart and putting them back together again and if anything went wrong for some reason I always knew what to do get them up and running again, and this really took off when I got into high school and they were offering computer engineering and networking classes.

Now I know a lot more then common PC user and I'm going to take up some classes in computer networking. As far as field experiences go I'm working for 6 months at a computer repair shop but left because the owner was was cheap and didn't want to buy legitimate software and or hardware to fix pc's and if he did buy hardware it was mostly second hand hardware that he didn't try out before he bought it. So now I'm just doing door to door work so I can build up a list of references as well. Though I would really like to get into some sort of helpdesk for now.

So where do I go from here? Where do I start? I've already made a account on helpdesk and I've signup for at a temp agency which I hope made the right choice in doing, and should I even bother changing my major?

He does not do his work.

He spends hours on a computer he is not supposed to be on torrenting instead of doing the work I bust my ass to get to him in a timely fashion (our work is extremely time-sensitive). I am talking almost a TB of pirated shit on a work server.

He has downloaded viruses many times (he has absolutely no idea what he is doing. A perfect example of this is that he hides his stockpile of crap in multiple levels of folders, unaware that all i have to do is search "".avi"" to find it all. Yes, he's an ass.)

Who gets to sit on the phone with our IT guy for HOURS while he tries to figure out what the hell is going on with a DNS hijacker, you ask? Why ME of course.

Here's the problem: I can't tell the owner of the company what this guy is doing because I KNOW he will completely disconnect the internet for EVERYONE. I work with graphic designers, and we absolutely NEED the web, not only for our sanity but for our work.

I'm fucking sick of it. My first idea was to just take the RAM out of the computer, and when it doesn't turn on tomorrow he will freak thinking he's put another virus on the computer, not be able to say anything to the owner because he's not supposed to be on it anyways (he's been caught downloading before), and that will be that.

I'm currently a 2nd year student in my university's IT school and am enjoying learning about the basics of IT. Now my current job is working at a pizza shop cooking food and obviously has nothing to do with my field, the only 'practice' I get is with family and friends when I need to fix something but even then I'm not really challenged and it's very basic stuff. I want to get the ball rolling with the IT gig by doing stuff outside of school but I don't really have a clue as to where to start. 

I don't know a ton about any certain area of IT as I'm still learning basics but my concentration will be in security with my degree. I was told by my uncle who is an IT guy to get certifications asap like A+ and Network + which I want to get. I guess my concern is that I won't have any real experience until I get a job and am afraid I won't know much of anything going in, I want to try to have some sort of experience before I apply for entry level jobs. 

Re-reading this makes it sound sort of silly that I won't have much experience before getting a job but I want to know what I'm doing, for the most part, when it comes to entry level job position tasks. Will those beginner certs be enough? Are there certain diagnostic programs or office programs I should familiarize myself with?

2) Send a couple test emails to see if she can send/receive them.

I've got a dilemma I'm faced with at work. A client (let's call him Mark) has been having trouble with his new Asus laptop purchase. He's exchanged it 3 times, always for the same one. Most recently, I had him from the first time and he was complaining about HDD errors and BSODs. I read the BSODs and they are related to faulty memory modules and sometimes ""Operating system not found"" or ""UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME"" (or something similar appears. He left it with me while I checked it out/ran diags.

Diags came up as bad memory, HDD and a bunch of viruses/mal ware.

Come to find out, he'd replaced the memory modules with faulty ones and the HDD with a smaller, older HDD with OS installed from original OS installations recovery discs. Luckily, we still had his other two laptops he'd purchased/exchanged. I checked them out and one was missing memory + HDD  altogether (our customer service/returns team isn't that sharp) and the other had one stick of original memory and missing HDD.

I'm assuming he's selling the parts online (especially the HDDs due to price increase). How should i/we go about denying this type of fraud? We're already out the money for his first two because Asus won't let us return it to them without the ooginal hardware intact. Should we send out an email to other stores in the area that he could try this at? Should we fix his current laptop even though he's replaced the parts and there's viruses/malware in the OS? (MFG warranty will cover hardware but not software issues). I'm afraid he'll complain to our corporate office and get his way. Any thoughts/experience dealing with this type of situation?

I've been at this new computer repair job for about a month and a half, and a couple days after I started, a girl brought in her HP Pavillion DM4-1060us that had a bad heatsink fan. I got it checked in and all apart (following the HP service manual for that machine), quoted her for the repair, and got the new heatsink/fan assembly installed. Went to put the machine back together and like magic, the display has no video at all. On further inspection, I found a nick in the display cable that must have happened on my initial disassembly.

The repair got put on the back burner for a while (we are primarily Apple repair, and have been swamped lately) so the computer sat for a couple weeks before I let the customer know about the mistake (And that we wouldn't be charging them any extra or anything)

Fast forward to today, when we got the display cable in. I had to take apart the actual display to install it, and thanks to HP's fucking wonderful service manuals, I managed to put a crack in the LCD and break off one of the hinge screw points in the back panel while removing the LCD bezel. I left a message with my service manager asking him to call me about the repair, but this was torwards the end of the day and I don't think he'll call back until tomorrow or Monday.

After mysterious screenshots from were sent to the ex by the hacker of Facebook messages, emails, etc to show the ex how bad of a guy he was, how he sleeps around, how he watches porn, etc surfaced, I tell the victim to check for the hack, and sure enough, its there. We also figure he is sniffing packets and spoofing login details to get into gmail because he asked questions that would only arise from seeing specific emails. The victim has had to resort to using his phone on 4g to access sensitive sites like Facebook etc, password lock everything, change all his passwords, enable 2 step verification, etc.

How should we confront the hacker, and how can we prevent further data compromise, since he has physical access to the computer in question and time alone when we are not home? How do we handle if the hacker refuses to come clean and cease? Are there any legal repercussions?

We like the guy, and before the girl got involved, everything seemed OK and we were good friends.

I'll give an example.  My helpdesk manager swears, when dealing with a failing/bad HDD, if you can't get it to mount with our external adapter on a windows PC, to use it on a Mac.  She says she has a higher success rate getting the disk mounted and read on a mac than a PC.  

But why would this be?  Same power supply, same USB interface, same cord...what about the mac, or underlying derivative linux architecture, would make that likely?  I'm still doubtful about that practice, but don't question her on it.  I haven't seen it used successfully enough times to say ""yes it works better than on a PC"" ...in fact, I'm trying to think of any times at all when it's helped.  

I had some other examples in my head earlier but can't remember them now.  I'm kind of already checked out, it's almost quittin' time on a Friday.

Seeking input from others.,21,4,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/o9fct/i_want_to_quit_my_tech_job_seeking_input_from/,"Here's the deal. I worked for another company for 8 months providing remote support to clients. Lost that job after being fucked over, was unemployed for several months. Decided there was more money in tech than in what I got my degree in, so I went out and got my A+ cert. After a few more months of searching, found an add on craigslist for a part time repair tech job.

I go in and apply and get the job on the spot. I was surprised, but excited to finally have an income again. The place is small. It's in a little strip mall about 30 mins from my house. The guy who interviewed me said I'd mainly be repairing computers and doing house calls from time to time. They offered me $15/hr. (my last job was $10, so I took it)

Anyways, I didn't know what I was walking into. I thought the guy who interviewed me worked at the company. He doesn't really. He does networking for another company and goes to school full time. His wife works as the secretary. The owner of the company died a month ago. (I found this out afterwards) He had his PhD in compsci, along with decades of tech experience. He basically was the company. He did EVERYTHING.

His brother has taken over for now, and while he also has his PhD, it's in economics and he doesn't know anything about computers. Nor does the secretary who literally sits on her laptop all day watching netflix until the phone rings and she grudgingly picks it up when I don't. (I'm busy actually working, and if I answered all the phones, then she'd literally have NOTHING to do.

So it's basically just me. I'm the company and I'm completely overwhelmed. There are no other techs. Nobody to help me out. The people I work with have no concept of how long it takes to diagnose a problem. They keep asking me what I'm doing, if something is done yet, etc. It's gotten to the point where I have a whiteboard with the status of all the computers so they'll hopefully stop bugging me. They also expect me to be able to do everything the previous owner could do. I'm fucking in my early 20's, have a degree in a non-relevant field, and only got my A+ in October. I can't do everything. I can barely do what I do. A lot of the time I find myself thinking ""fuck, I have no idea what I'm doing or what's wrong with this thing!""

Now they want me to go out and do a house call to some business to update their servers. I've never touched a server in my life. I have no idea what the fuck to do. The guy who hired me is a server guy, but he's never in the store, and I think he gets irritated whenever I need help or I can't do something. I strongly get the feeling that I was the first person to respond to the ad in craigslist and that they hired me on the spot because they had computers pilling up in the back.

I would like them to hire more techs, but I'm afraid they barely have enough money to pay me. (They originally wanted to give me $12/hr) The thing that makes it complicated is that when the owner died, he left a widow and 2 small children. I think this business was their only source of income. (It was sudden cancer too, so I don't think they were prepared for it.)

So yeah. I want to quit, but then I'd lose my income and be forced to move back in with my parents. *shudder* Not sure exactly what to do. All I know is that every morning when I wake up and go to work, I'm automatically in a bad mood and hating life.

**tl;dr** Got hired on as only tech for a repair company, completely overwhelmed, want to quit.

In this position too, I've wrote custom batch files, macros, dug into tons of standards, policy changes (for the good), and so forth. 

In my free time, I do volunteer work for a local homeless shelter by offering my skillset to them, and currently working on revamping their whole website. I have 2 'servers' at home (G640 and P4), one is running WHS2011, and the other Debian with a LAMP setup on it, virtual box for multiple learning environments for BackTrack Linux learning and such.

Longer Version


I'm 17 years old and at a cross road in my life. I'm not entirely sure what to do with my future, my one passion in life is computers but I am way to terrible at math to pursue Computer Science or Computer Engineering.  My other degree of choice would be Political Science which I love (the schooling of it) but I don't see myself going anywhere major in terms of career choices. I'm not entirely sure but i'd think it'd be very disappointing to my parents if I go for something outside of a more lucrative and formal 4 year degree. But I do know how expensive college is and I don't want to waste time and absurds amount of moneys pursuing something I  know will be a waste of my time. 

Anyways my question to you all is does anyone here have a job in IT that doesn't involve a Comp Sci. or Comp Eng degree? Do I have reasonable job outlook with an Associates in Science in IT (looking at something broad like ""Computer Information Technology"" or maybe ""Networking Services Technology""). Is the pay decent?

I can't say that I'm really all that surprised, I've always done my job and I've always done it well, but since my ""manager"" keeps trying to play ""technician"" and keeps breaking customers' computers, we end up losing more money than we bring in.  What little money we do bring in, goes up in smoke (either marijuana or tobacco) when it SHOULD be used to pay us on time!  At least I did finally get my meager $0.30/hr increase, a full 30 days after I was promised after 60 days of employment, so now I make $8.70/hr.  Oh, and they cut my hours, so now I work part-time.  I can't really file for unemployment, as they've been paying me under the table.

I am located in Michigan, and I'm not sure exactly what to do.  I've tried applying at other computer repair stores in the area, but none of them have contacted me, and I suspect it's due to the negative reputation that my current place of employment has.  My lease here ends in June, at which point I'm moving back in with my parents in Arkansas, and we've discussed the possibility of me starting a repair business out of the house.  I think I'm a little young and don't have the funds to start a storefront, nor would I want to tie myself down to one location for the foreseeable future, although financial stability would be quite nice.  I've created an account on LinkedIn, where I have a recommendation from one of my co-workers.  I've applied to a few jobs via LinkedIn, Indeed.com, and Dice.com, as well as sending my resume to an IT recruiter here in Michigan as soon as I saw his post on a private forum, and my fingers are crossed that I will hear from him.  I've also been applying to jobs here in Arkansas in the meantime, because it would be nice to have a few interviews lined up for as soon as I arrive back in town in June.  I've even considered the National Guard, it appears like they have a PAID computer training program that comes with it's own share of benefits.

Since I'll only be here for the next 6 months, I don't know if it's such a good idea to start up my own business here, there is a lot of strong competition but not a lot of employment here in Michigan.  I've gotten one other potential job offer from a very helpful Redditor that also visits this subreddit (I won't call you out!) for a part-time position in Texas, but ideally I'd like to find a full time position because I'm trying to save up some money to have a bright future.

In any case, /r/computertechs, it would be nice to hear what some of you guys have to say, because my plans are up in the air at the moment.  There is no official word yet on me being unemployed, but all signs are STRONGLY suggesting that things are headed in that direction.  I.E. both of the websites for both of the stores I work at (we have multiple locations) haven't been working for MONTHS, my co-workers haven't seen our boss for WEEKS, his girlfriend is poorly managing both stores and a ton of our customers have been leaving bad reviews for both of our stores.  For example, all virus removals are now OS reloads, even when an OS reload isn't necessary, that's what we're instructed to do, and I'm morally and ethically against it, but at the same time I NEED to pay my rent!!!  I'm CompTIA A+ certified and have over 5 years of hands-on repair experience, so if you'd like to help me network and connect through LinkedIn, I would certainly appreciate it.  If you have any helpful advice, I'm all ears.

From my perspective, I tend to look at purchasing home computers very simply:

1) Find out what they want to use the machine for, then advise them 
    on the appropriate specs based on what they actually need, i.e. you don't 
    need a high end machine if you're essentially buying a Microsoft 
    Office + Facebook machine, which seems to be about 90 percent of 
    users.

2) A Windows PC is essentially just that at the end of the day. 
   Regardless of brand or manufacturer. You can find the same 
   range of hardware in all the major brands, and they all ship with the  
   same Operating System. I concede however, that some brands 
   might ship with more bloatware than others right out of the box.

I have a feeling that many of you might take issue with the second point, and I would genuinely love to hear your thoughts on this! I think that any constructive input you guys share would be enlightening.

I want to reiterate that I am talking about Computers for personal use here. Obviously in the business setting we take in to account other factors such as image stability and business support, but I feel that these are irrelevant in the case of someone who wants a home computer.

Thanks to you fellow techs! I look forward to hearing from you!

**TL;DR: Everything I do that remotely touches on networking always ends up breaking apart in my hands for reasons that mystify myself and everyone I know.**

I guess I'm the sort of person whom Satan decided to single out as a personal target.  I can put a computer together just fine.  I can keep my installation running smoothly for a long time.  Hell, I managed to make a box tough out Windows Millenium for two years with nary an ill effect.

Give me an RJ-45 cable however, and my life becomes like the movie Final Destination.

I have every trouble in the world dealing with my office network.  I'm the only person to whom this happens.  For the longest time, I could not connect to the office VPN and the tech tried everything on it before giving up.  I was given a new workstation later on, only to see the problem repeat itself despite a fresh installation.  Then came the added complexity of connecting to different client machines using several different VPN softwares.  All my coworkers could get the two most popular ones working just fine.  On mine however, SonicWALL would work two or three times after install, and then would never be able to connect anywhere again.  I installed a virtual machine only to run on SonicWALL, with the same results.  The tech ended up making a clone of his own VM and giving this one to me.  What do you know: SonicWALL took the shit after barely a day.  My tech is utterly convinced I did something to the VM, some sort of manipulation for the thing to stop working on my machine.  But I hadn't.  I had connected once to verify it worked, then shut down the VM and turned it on the next day to go fetch a file on a customer's server.

I am the only one who needs to input his password everytime I connect to the sources repository, even if I check the ""save password"" box.  When I run the software we're developing, I'm the only one to experience various seemingly random connection/SQL/application server errors that no one can explain.  And this happened on both latest machines I was given.  Only recently did the office solve my Wi-Fi woes - they switched to a new management/software protocol or whatever it was and I was asked to test if it worked.  To my astonishment, I connected.  I had good reason to be surprised: for the past year, my machine had been the only one to fail to connect to the wireless network and no one could understand why.

At home, it's not much brighter.  I've gone through seven routers so far and I need to start shopping for an eighth.  Here is how they all went:

* 1: Linksys Wireless - Couldn't wireless its way through a gyproc wall.
* 2: Linksys 4-port - Randomly entered into a panic mode and refused any and all connections, including to its internal admin page, until it was unplugged for a full minute.
* 3: D-Link DI-624 Wireless - Crashed and self-rebooted at such breakneck speed that I was banned from a chatroom for join-flooding at 2:00 AM while I was asleep.
* 4: Inexq 4-port - Modifying the virtual server parameters caused the router to immediately crash.
* 5: Homemade m0n0wall box - Both NICs physically failed after a week.
* 6: Bell Sympatico router-modem combo - Oftentimes lost connection for no apparent reason, was unable to save port forward settings.
* 7: Linksys-Cisco WRT54GL - Supposedly the holy grail of routers.  My fucking ass.  One of the physical ports became inoperative, and then the device spontaneously reset itself to factory settings after giving me a dazzling light show worthy of a deadmau5 concert.

I keep hearing people going ""router (x) sucks balls, get router (y), it's the last one you'll ever need in your life.""  You can't believe how often I've heard that.  I listened to equal amounts of love and hate for Linksys, D-Link, Belkin, Buffalo, you name it.  Everyone I know has used the same router practically all their life, for several years without failure.  I go through a router a year on average.  To this day I have never been able to find one that works perfectly.  There is always a glitch, some way to instacrash it and it happens to be on the feature I need at the moment.

I don't even listen when people suggest devices to me anymore.  I know that whatever I grab, it'll be another fistful of dollars down the drain, things will work fine for a while and then the router will take a giant shit for no apparent reason.  It doesn't matter what they tell me.  They can say the router is impervious to nuclear bombs for all I care.  In the list above, a bunch of them were claimed as ""the last router I will ever need, period.""  They oftentimes were the worst performers of the bunch, becoming flat out inoperative after a few months.  The best ones, go figure why, were the spare shitboxes I borrowed from friends as a quick fix and which then proceeded to last for an unexpectedly long time until I got fed up with whatever feature I was needing on them and didn't work and never had worked.

I don't even try to do what the office techs suggest anymore.  I simply invite them to sit at my workstation and have at it.  So far, I have a perfect record of them working upwards of an hour of setting things up only to leave with no solution and a bunch of miscellaneous installers and diagnostic tools on my machine.

Nobody can comprehend the extent of what happens between me and network devices, myself first of all.

As far as I'm concerned, networking is black magic.  Plain and simple.  It works because of reasons that escape my rational thoughts.  It stops working from one day to the next and I'm clueless why.  I've stopped trying to understand; I know I'd be fighting a worthless cause.

If you read this all the way to the bottom, well, thanks.  I hope it's made you feel lucky and cherished for a while.  Maybe when you plug your next network in and it works well on the first go, you'll get to appreciate it a little more.",,False,,t5_2soz7,False,,,True,t3_m847x,http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/m847x/my_incredible_bad_luck_with_networking/,

These PCs will be used by people who are seeking jobs, for doing things like searching job listings, editing resumes, etc. 

I need to lock down the computers so that they don't get all messed up by the users (you know how public PCs go), but the computers aren't domain-attached. One of them runs Win 7 Home Premium (so I can't set local group policy either since that's only available on Win 7 Pro), and the other runs XP Pro. 

I'm trying to meet a few criteria in completing this work. First, since it's a non-profit organization, I need to do as much as possible to keep their costs low. Second, I'd like to do the same thing to both computers so that I can more or less treat both computers the same instead of going with one solution on each. As to technical details, we need people to be able to run only basic office-type software (calculator, Office Suite, internet browser, etc.), and we also want to block them from visiting undesirable websites. 

I was looking at doing Deep Freeze and Win Select for locking down computer access and setting a fallback image for when people mess things up, and then K9 Web Protection for blocking internet access. However, those first two are $45 each, and K9 is around $20... $200+ is probably a little steep for their software budget. If that's really the best way of accomplishing this, I can probably convince them to do it, but I thought I'd check with you guys first. 

What are your favorite ways of locking down PCs designated for public access?

***Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions guys! I think we will put Deep Freeze on both PCs for keeping the system in good shape, and probably K9 to lock down web access. To start, I'll probably just go with using user account settings to limit their access to core OS functions and let the Deep Freeze restore prevent major issues. If the users mess things up too bad, I'll look at doing some further tweaks to limit their access.*** ",,False,,t5_2soz7,1369262015.0,,,True,t3_1eu4i0,http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/1eu4i0/preferred_ways_of_locking_down_a_public_pc/,

After that ive been replacing old P4/xp workstations with newer core2/win7 machines, i now have only one (mostly unused) workstation with xp remaining.

I know little about active directory or domains in general and what features i should be using. The server now serves little purpose in my opinion (aside from file sharing) and all features remain unchanged from before i took over:

* DHCP server
* DNS server
* Users are managed by active directory (nothing else is as far as i can tell)
* File services (a couple shares that applications use and one common share for the entire office to share or store files)

Our company is more of an on-call place, where people call in and either bring in their computer to be repaired or we'll go out to their house and fix it. It's solely a tech support company, not a parts sales company (although we attempt to sell parts in addition to services).

At my new job (which I'm still in training for), I'll be required to do opening stuff, check in customer's computers as they come in for appointments, fix said computers, ship some off to be repaired if the repairs are more serious, and just all around manage the shop while the other employee works out in the field.

I'm not sure what else to put here. So if you need more info, just ask! Thanks for any input!

Upon driving past, I spotted a computer tower, so I turned around to go check it out.  

Now for the record, I live in the country, so to find a computer literally just sitting on the side of the road is tempting.  I stopped to ask if I could take it, but no one was home.  So I went home.  I went back about an hour later, but still no one there.  At this point, I had decided that if it was in the trash, it was okay for me to take.  So I put it in my truck and drove home.  

It's an emachine T1140 with a 1.10 GHz processer, a 20 GB hard-drive and only 256 MB of RAM.  I hooked it up with some assorted cables I had laying around and it worked fine.  Turned on, POSTed fine, and began to load the OS until the loading screen finished, then the screen went blank and said ""Not supported format.""  I booted it with VGA Mode enabled and it worked fine, so I had determined the problem was the refresh rate.  Easy fix.  So now it was all working just fine.  No problems whatsoever.  Being the nice person I am, I decided to try to return it to it's original owners.  I went back, and still no one there.  I left a note with my name and cell number in case they wanted it back.

**tl;dr - Found a computer in the trash.  Fixed it.  Now not sure what to do.**

First question: How long should I wait for them to call back before I just wipe off their data and start using it?  I'm planning on waiting a week, and if they don't call by then, I'm gonna clean it up and either sell it or use it for kicks and giggles.

Second question: If I do keep it, what should I do with it?  It's too slow with too small of a hard-drive to really do anything with.

Third question: If I don't keep it, should I sell it as a unit or disassemble it and sell it for parts?

I work at a rather large company that doesn't do anything related to IT but we have a decent-sized IT department due to the size of the company and our network. A position opened up recently for a ""Desktop Analyst"" which I applied for and got an interview.

I'll preface this by saying I've only done three interviews in my life and I've only had two jobs. My interviewing skills are probably terrible but I plan to do some searching around for general advice before the interview. I've been working at this company for over two years and I think if I do well in the interview I have a great chance of getting the position. I mainly want to get some advice related to interviews for IT positions.

I don't have access to what was listed with the position anymore as it's been taken down. Basically, though, it said that it entails installing / troubleshooting windows, providing some level 2 support, and a few other things that I can't really remember right now. Our company uses thin client/terminal servers so it says you need to have an understanding of them. I've never worked with them (other than using the thin client while working, no experience with terminal servers) but I have a general understanding of the concept.

I just finished school (2 year degree) for computer networking and am working on my CCNA. Honestly, I haven't done much pc troubleshooting, etc. lately because I haven't needed to, but I do know how to do a lot of things. I'm trying to get my foot in the door in the IT field and get some sort of experience. I'm wondering how they usually test your knowledge in interviews for these types of positions. This position isn't technically entry level but it's close to it. I was told I'm going to be interviewed by 4 people who are currently in IT (all will be present at the interview).

This position is at our rather new location that is being populated with new people. I don't know what kind of IT department they have at that location, but I think initially some of what I might be doing is setting up new PCs there (obviously that's just temporary). After that it'd probably just be providing support for the people at that location.

One option i have is to leave the motherboard in working order and mess around with parts on the machine as this allows the person to replace parts to test if their theory about why it isn't working is correct or not.

Another option they asked me was to overload a capacitor and have them identify what is broken. I don't agree that much with this one, simply because if the motherboard is gone, 99% of the time you're simply replacing the board and not going to solder on a new item.

My real-world experience so far, in terms of physical issues have been:

* IDE belt head broken at motherboard end. So I've already opened the connector, and cut off the last 6-8 wires then closed it making it look like nothing happened unless you look carefully. When the machine starts, it just says Boot failure, no Operating System available, so that works.
* Removed 2 RAM pins, one on each side. Doesn't even post now.
* Loosely connected the AT power connector, I'm thinking about somehow removing one of the 20-pin wires from the plastic head.
* Removed all thermal paste on the cpu/heatsink.
* Stopped the CPU fan from spinning (it's not broken, just paper wedge holds it)

I would assume one issue would be the number of people who don't have boot-to-usb set before boot-to-hdd, but they may have a workaround for that in the form of some friendly guide.

However, the 3 pc limit is weird. Do they write to the USB stick the time and date of the last access by a certain computer (I guess they may include the MAC address to identify it)?  If so, does that mean that a smart virus could write to the USB stick a way to propagate instead? I wouldn't want to recommend it to the Frequent Fliers if it turns out it can be infected easily.

I start training in a week. However, today they called me back stating that an L2 position opened up. Due to my past experience and my resume, they would have no issues just changing me over to that and wonder if I am interested. They left me a VM and I plan to call tomorrow with my answer. The L1 position is $13.30/hr and the L2 is $15/hr.

The L1 is a day shift, and L2 is a graveyard shift. Also instead of training being in a week, training starts this monday for L2.

Normally this would be a no brainer. More money is nice. However, I have never worked in an L2 position, and am unsure of how much harder it is over an L1. I have always wanted to, but in this job I got I am also dealing with things I have not dealt with for a while. Both positions prefer Linux experience, but not required. The L2 position also states, while Linux is not required, it is preferred and even a cert. in Linux is preferred. As well as other certs. The only cert. I have is an MCP. Though I probably have the experience to match other certs.

I have never dealt with Linux in a support role, and my only experience is messing with it a bit on a virtual machine using VMware.

To give you an idea of my experience. I have almost seven years of technical support experience for various companies. I used to work for Dell in Gold Technical support/Pro Support (Their highest, most expensive, level of support). I have an MCP that I passed back in 2006 without even studying for (though this may not be unusual, I am unsure). Really the only thing I don't know much about for these jobs is Linux.

My main concern is going into the L2 position and not knowing everything they expect me to know. Is this a valid concern seeing that they already said I have the job if I want it? Do you think I can learn/pick up on what I need to know as time goes by? Another, lesser, concern is it being a graveyard shift. Those of who may know, would an L2 position have enough perks, other than the obvious pay raise, over the L1 position to warrant going to a graveyard shift over a day shift?

The owner died the month before and I was pretty much the only one working on the computers trying to keep the store going.

The owner's brother closed the store down four months later and gave me a lot of the stuff sitting around the shop. This included several hard drives. Well I plug in one of the hard drives today to transfer some files to it and I see that there are several personal user folders there. I think they're from four different people. 

I opened up one of the folders and saw that they had lots of pictures that could be sentimental (baby pics, family pets, trips to Europe, etc etc..) along with various work/tax/school documents. 

I don't know if the owners had all of these things backup and don't need these files, or if they think they've lost them forever now that the store is no longer there. 

So far I've managed to find a resume for one of the users and it contains contact info. If this is stuff they'd like back, I'd like to give it to them, but I don't want to get in trouble.

I'm afraid that if I contact them out of the blue and say ""Hey, I was a computer tech at X store and I discovered all your personal information on a hard drive that was given to me after the store closed, do you want it?"" that they might accuse me of something or try to screw me.

What do you guys earn?,15,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/r8r6l/help_renegotiating_compensationbenefits_what_do/,"So here's the deal. My organization (8 employees / 3 stores) is being sold, giving me the opportunity to renegotiate my compensation/title/benefits. 

We're a local organization of three stores, that is part of a national (loosely managed) franchise. 

I function as the store manager, and lead technician for one of these locations. I've been with the business since 2006. I don't have the official title, but only because my boss doesn't believe in titles. He's told me repeatedly to put manager on my resume. 

I'm currently making 12.75/hr with no benefits (health etc.) and 2 weeks/yr vacation. 

The reason I've put up with sub-standard comp. is the flexibility afforded to me. I've been able to come up with any schedule I want to work around college, at time working as little as 3 days a week. 
The new owner is an individual that has some technical knowledge, but comparatively very little. He also has no small business management experience, although he just retired as a VP from a corporation. 

With the new management having NO operational information, they're going to rely on myself and 1 other manager (from a different store) to show them how the entire business runs. I'm going to use this opportunity to solidify my title as manager and ask for increased compensation. 

I plan on offering a guarantee (possibly contract) ensuring that I stay with the company for X time period, ensuring a smooth transition. I also have tons of ideas for growth and development that I'm planning on pitching, both accomplishing thing I'd like to see happen, and demonstrating my leadership/development skills.

A family member has run a few tax prep stores since 2004 and unfortunately their office computers are from the same time period. This means they are about 8 years old. They've got 1GB of RAM, Windows XP, 40GB hard drives with Celeron processors. They are pretty much archaic and buying 10 new ones isn't completely in the budget.

As horrific as I find Celerons to be, the main problem is how slow they are - you can hear the hard drives grinding around constantly. Hard Drive SMART data shows each drive has ""Power On Hours"" around 4-5 years each. They can pretty much croak any time now. Defragging doesn't do anything at this point other than probably shortening their lifespan even more.

My main idea was to ghost the old drives onto new ones which would probably speed things up tremendously, but even then, I don't think it's worth it.

The other thing I considered was trying to get them to pony up the cash for new ones. I was able to put together some components and figured out a decent custom-built desktop would run them about $550 each including Windows licenses.

Lastly, it would probably be fairly ghetto, was to build a VMWare ESX box of some sort and install multiple copies of Windows and have them remote access Windows virtual machines from each existing desktop..but again this probably isn't a good idea.

Does ComputerTechs have any suggestions on how to bring a bit more life to old computers, or is ponying up $500 for 5-10 computers a better option at this point?

Yes, you. Here's my situation. Background: A+ certified, roughly 2 years help desk xp. I lost my job back in August. I just got hired yesterday for a part time tech position. The posting on craigslist said the salary was between $12-15/hr. In the interview, he didn't really touch on salary, saying that he wanted to speak to more candidates, but that the job would be 10-5, M-TH with an hour lunch. (24 hours a week) They hired me the very next day and today was my first day on the job.

The company that hired me is really small. The owner, and main tech, just died three weeks back, leaving only an employee who specializes in networking, and his wife, who runs the storefront/phones. The main tech's brother has taken over the business for the time being, but doesn't really do much with computers. 

I started today despite not having been told an exact salary. I asked the woman who runs the storefront (the only other person in the office with me today) if her husband had said anything about hourly pay and she replied with ""I'm not sure. I think it was $12? Is that ok?"" I told her I'd have to discuss it with him.

I've burned through all my savings trying to stay afloat since I lost my job in August. I'm $1500 in debt to my father, and I still have another two months in a rent that's running me a total of $700-$800/mo depending on heating bills. 

I know that $15/hour is the industry average for new techs. Even if I was getting paid $15/hr for 24hrs a week, I'd still just be **barely** keeping my head above water with rent/utilities/food/gas. Given that, I really can't do $12/hr. That would cover rent, that's it. Forget food/gas/clothing/anything else. They said that one of my job duties would be to grow the company when I'm not fixing computers, since they only have 3 business clients and a few walk-ins. 

This, combined with the low pay, leaves a bad taste in my mouth because the last company I worked for couldn't afford to hire me either. My last boss hired me at only $10/hr with the hope that she'd be able to get more business and the ability to actually pay me the same level as everyone else. ($4-7/hr higher than what she was paying me) After 9 months of being on 120 day ""probationary pay"" that job fell through.

Also, the fee structure is so cryptic you have no idea how much they are charging until well after the fact (because it varies by card) I've looked into ""Interchange plus"" pricing which seems to be the most fair way... but these have monthly fees associated with them, we don't do a TON of credit cards, (I'd say 20 a month?) so im not sure if the monthly fee are worth it

when we do remote support, we started emailing invoices to customers. We found a plugin for quickbooks that will email a customer an invoice and provide a paypal link. it works great even if the customer doesn't have a paypal account. The fees are reasonable (I think $0.30+2.9%) but I'm not really a paypal fan... I hate how it takes a 5 days or so for the money to get in my bank account and how I have to manually ""grab"" the money from paypal. (also, if I go to buy something on ebay or a place that accepts paypal, it always defaults to take the money out of your paypal balance FIRST, before it will let you use a credit card or your bank account.. which makes keeping track of this a nightmare, I always make sure to empty the paypal account before making any purchases so I can use my credit card.)

My parents were really pushing me to go to college so I ended up applying and getting into cal poly for manufacturing engineering. The reason I didn't apply for computer science was that I didn't do all that well in HS, only had a 3.2. One of my dads friends mentioned how his daughter got into the college she wanted to go to by applying for manufacturing and then switching, which is what I planned on doing (Looking back this was a stupid idea but I really wanted to go to cal poly). Things ended up not going that well and it looks like I might get kicked out.



Anyways, back on track. Like I said at the start I have always wanted to go into tech support, so I was just wondering what would be the best way to do that. Should I go straight into looking for jobs or should I try and get some sort of certifications first?

Full story:  Last Thursday, a girl needed her internal video cable replaced on her laptop.  We had prearranged for the $15 cable to be here by the time she brought in her computer to the college helpdesk.  With a one-hour turnaround, our full-time technician replaced the cable, tested it, contacted her.  When she got here, once again we booted it, showing that the problem was gone...the display no longer flickered when she moved the screen.  She took it home, and we thought that was that.  

Fast-forward to yesterday, she comes in and the laptop has NO video on the internal display.  No backlight, no video, nothing.  Dead.  Works on external screen.  She said she used it over the weekend to write some papers on, and it was fine;  But when she booted it monday morning to print the papers, the screen was dead.  

I hooked it up to an external display to let her pull her papers off, and then proceeded to dismantle things.  After re-seating all the cable connections, I took a really close look at the connector to the motherboard and realized it didn't look quite right.  It's so tiny I could barely see it, so I took my Lumix and snapped a couple macro photos of it.  

http://imgur.com/a/HpHNx

I'm diagnosing that port/connector as FUBAR. I don't think there's any way we can repair it, and considering it's a 2007 laptop, not worth the cost or effort to replace the motherboard.  

But what I would like to know is this:  What in the hell caused that?  it looks to me like it shorted out and melted out between a couple pins there.  Any ideas/explanations/comments/""I had this happen to me before"" stories?  

Thanks!


**ETA**  With a high-powered magnifying glass and a needle, we were able to clean out in between the pins, and after reassembly, it WORKS!  It's never going to be the same again, really, but it's better than nothing, I suppose.

Here are the specifications:

*  Model: Compaq Presario CQ60-211DX
* Processor: 2.16 GHz Intel Celeron Processor 585
* RAM: 4GB (Upped from the original 2GB)
* 250GB (Upped from original 160GB)
 
TL;DR at the bottom.

The person initially told me that there was an image when the laptop was turned on, but that it was dark. This made me assume that the inverter was bad, and if you look at the picture, you can see that the inverter is exposed. I thought I'd take a chance on the purchase since inverters aren't too expensive. 

First, I brought it in, fired it up, and discovered that the only things wrong with it, at first glance at least, was that the inverter was exposed, the screen was detached from the hinges, and the bottom of the bezel was broken. I screwed the screen back onto the hinges, and screwed the bezel back on. I then upgraded the HDD and RAM.

Next, I booted it up with the new HDD, and noticed that the fan was loud. I tried blowing the dust out and rebooting, but I got the same issue. ""Crap!"" I thought. I knew I'd have to take it apart to get the dust out of the heatsink. I got down to the heatsink, got the dust off it, cleaned off the heatsink, CPU, and GPU, and applied Arctic Silver 5 to the CPU and GPU. I put it back together and booted it up.
 
I then began to notice that even though I could hear the fan turning, it was getting extremely hot; hot enough even to cause graphic skipping and automatic shutdown. I shut it down a while to let it cool, and then ran HWMonitor when I booted it back up. I was astonished to find that the CPU was idling at 87C and that the GPU was idling at 85C. Under load, I was even more astonished to find that the GPU was going up to 103C. Needless to say I had to go back in.

At first I thought I had not put enough thermal compound on. Once I got back down to the heatsink, I checked what I had put on, and decided to put a bit more on the GPU since the compound was replacing a thermal pad. Also, I noticed that I had not looked inside the heatsink fan. Once I took the fan apart, I noticed a big clump of dust. ""That'll do it."" I thought to myself. I then put everything back together.

After that, I fired it back up and reran HWMonitor. Removing that final clump of dust had done the trick. The CPU was idling at 36C/48C load, and the GPU was idling at 40C/55C load; mission completed.

Here's what it looks like [now](http://i.imgur.com/t6Np6.jpg). All in all, I spent a few hours getting everything fixed up, and I could do it all because I'm a tech.

We are working with SharePoint at the moment, but it is more than we need and it's costing us more than I think it should.

Can anyone recommend a service that would host these files, preferably giving us a bare-bones client portal style interface, allowing clients to download and view the files after logging in.

A little background first. I am a college graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Homeland Security, with a ""Cyber Security"" track. (Yes, I know ""Cyber"" is a buzz word but that's what it says on the piece of paper. Upper management tends to fawn at it. Go figure.) I went to a medium sized telecom company as a Security Administrator Intern to get my last six internship credits, and stayed there for as long as they could manage to retain me. Once that job ended, I moved to a new company as an IT Operations Technician.

I've been handed a job offer by my old company that I went to for that internship. They want me to be an IT Security Analyst I, working full time. This seems like a great opportunity. Compared to my current job, I'd be getting comparable benefits, a slight pay raise due to the shortened commute and lack of taxes (getting a job in a tax free state rocks). The only thing I'm losing is my current company's PC Reimbursement program and a week of vacation per year. And yes, IT Security is what I want to do for a living.

But the problem is I feel a loyalty to my current company, almost to the point that it's making me debate turning down this new job offer. Have you guys ever run into this before? My current company's never done wrong by me. It's a great environment with great co-workers and a great boss... It's just an extremely long commute, and not the field I want to be in for the rest of my life.

I guess what I'm saying is, what are your thoughts? Do you, /r/computertechs, think it's worth it to move, despite the unexplained loyalty? Thanks for taking the time to read this.

For years I've been using a ""One-Click VNC"" solution (basically, VNC configured to automatically connect to my DynDNS name, and converted to a single EXE file via WinRAR).

I don't know which version of VNC it uses (I got it from [here](http://www.vncscan.com/vs/oneclickVNC.htm) back in 2006). But it's getting old and slow and (most importantly) it disconnects any time a UAC prompt comes up in Vista\7 (which is often, because I'm troubleshooting some issue, right?). The UAC thing hasn't been much of a problem, as most of my clients are still running XP. But those XP boxes are starting to die, and my clients are replacing them with Windows 7 computers... so it's only going to get worse.

So.. what remote access apps do you guys use? It needs to be: a) free (like I said, I'm an independent IT guy, so my budget for this is $0); b) easy for end-users; c) doesn't freak out at UAC prompts; d) isn't detected as a threat by AV software (my home-grown VNC app sets off MSE every time, which freaks out residential customers); and e) hopefully doesn't set off a million Windows security warnings.

I'm leaning towards TeamViewer (I like the speed and relative simplicity of the connection process), but I don't like the ""why not upgrade???"" ads they show ON THE CLIENT MACHINE after I disconnect.

Thanks in advance, guys! I try to use RDP whenever I can, but there's always that one company or client that refuses!

**EDIT:** Thanks for the tips, guys! Keep 'em coming! I should add that this software is something I'll only use a couple of times a month, tops (another reason it hasn't been a big issue until now). The clients who call me most frequently already have some kind of remote access (Remote Web Workplace or DesktopCentral, mostly).

We need a software that will ask the user for permission when we connect to prevent anyone from getting mad about us being intrusive.

Another big plus would be a software that can relate to Group Policy in some way. The most important thing is asking for permission though.

Another plus would be a software that runs as a service so we can look at the computer if the user is unable to login to windows, our version of SCCM is not capable of that.

One last thing, a lot of the people that we will use this software on will be off network, possibly connected through VPN, sometimes VPN is the issue though. So a software that can connect to a machine when it is off network is needed as well.

Does anyone have possibly reliable solutions that will fill these categories?

I've been doing individual/small business IT work for a while now, but recently got a job at a large university.  I was told they have a KMS server for new installs/reinstalls of Windows 7, and they provided me a key that matched exactly what is listed on Technet about KMS keys: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff793421.aspx  (FJ82H-XT6CR-J8D7P-XQJJ2-GPDD4)



I've been using the key with media that I make from a Windows 7 Pro SP1 retail image from my Technet, and then updating with RT Seven Lite. I hate new installs taking more than 30 minutes...  The ""retail"" ISO I get from Technet for Vista and 7, in my experience, successfully activates pretty much all key paths. That is, unlike XP where there was separate media for OEM, Retail, Volume, and Upgrade.



Anyway... once a machine is on our network and pulls an IP on its subnet, the KMS key I entered while using my retail media activates Windows successfully. I've had no problems at all.



Well one day, I mentioned how I made my updated media, and a co-worker on the same level as me freaked the hell out. He said ""no, no no! You *have* to use *our* media!""  There's nothing special or altered about ""their"" media. It's just a copy of Windows 7 Pro similar to mine that accept all the same keys, except it's really out of date. No SP1, *no* alterations* whatsoever. If I were to start out with their image and *then* slipstream everything, it always becomes a mess of a resulting image by the time I'm done.



So my thinking is that the people think I'm using pirated media or something, which I'm not, or they don't understand their own stuff and are incorrectly thinking something is magical about their media.

I'm writing a script for a series of short films that would become basically, a whole movie but in four parts. 
     
I know quite a bit about computers but little to nothing when it comes to networking or any computer knowledge at an enterprise level. I've tried doing research, but nothing has really taken. So I'm here to ask some questions and to ask advice. 

I'll explain so far what I have and then I'll explain what I need. (bear with me, this is all going to sound stupid, and this is why I need your help) The first act is to have a small government server lab essentially get hit by a DDOS. At the same time, I need to have my main antagonist slip in a few pages worth of volatile code. 

One of the first problems I encountered was the fact that I know most government servers are not connected to the internet for this very reason. So in order for a DDOS to happen, and for him to get access to the servers, he physically needs to be there. Which is fine, because I was hoping to turn this into an actual plot point. 

However, the biggest problem I have is figuring out what this actual code is and how to make it time sensitive with an immediate sense of danger. I don't want this project to end up coming out like a bad episode of CSI. 

So if any of you have any ideas on how to improve my idea or a completely different idea that would work, I'm open to all suggestions. Even ones pointing me in a different subreddit. Thanks so much!

edit: I should mention that the DDOS is just a cover up for planting the code. Its not relevant to the code at all. Just a means of distraction. If there is a better distraction you can think of, let me know.

edit 2: Thank you guys so much for your replies. I like a lot of these ideas and they've given me a nice place to start.

Budding young tech here. I want to get some practice with virus/spyware/badstuff removal as it seems to be the area I'm most lacking in currently. Most of my experience with this stuff is on the preventative side.

I figured a good way to go about this was to set up a few machines in VirtualBox and go out into the depths of the internet and get myself infected. The problem is, I'm having trouble catching anything out there. 

First, I tried to put myself into the shoes of a teenage user by downloading Kazaa and Limewire. Unfortunately, those seem to have been shut down, at least in their previous forms. I'm also having a surprisingly hard time catching anything by browsing random porn sites and just clicking every link I can find.

I suppose it's possible that I *have* caught something and just haven't noticed any symptoms yet. In the meantime, I'm looking for some guidance. 

How do people manage to get all these infections? Can anybody suggest some shady browsing I could be doing to speed this up a bit? I can't even seem to find a site with a link to a fake virus scan.

* Flushed the DNS

* Upgraded IE

* Reset TCP/IP Stack

* Reset Winsock 

* Tried another web-browser

* Delete all saved networks then re-connected 

* Check Internet Settings (Proxys etc)

* Full scan with Malware Bytes

* Disabled Firewall

As suggested in the title there are three general solution types I usually use. I'm looking for both a birds-eye view discussion of my options, and the gritty details of the bullets listed below.

* Password Recovery
* Create Administrator Account
* Wipe user password

Password recovery

* Password recovery is usually done by running OphCrack. I only have the free rainbow tables for Win7. Does anyone know if I can use the NTLM rainbow table hashes from https://freerainbowtables.com/ in lieu of the free tables from the OphCrack project? Is there any smoothing that needs to be done to make this work, or is it implemented in a different way completely? Are there any other tools that can do better brute forcing? What are the best methods for Win7 recovery?

Create Administrator Account

* We can use the commercial Kon-boot to login bypassing the password, and create a new user. Alternatively you can do the Utility hack where an inserted malicious app does privilege escalation for a backdoor command line, enabling you to add user accounts via the command line. Or you can use an offline registry editing tool to enable a disabled Administrator account. Are there any other easy methods to create another account with Admin rights?

Wipe user password

* You can use ntpasswd or ntpwedit to overwrite the user data, however it does it in a bit of an invasive way, potentially adversely affecting certain user rights, and access to encrypted drives in the process. Does anyone know all of the limitations here? Are there other tools that can be used?

Am I missing any obvious techniques?

My first actual IT related job was in the Best Buy geek squad.  It wasn't ideal, by far, but it gave me start in the field to some extent.  I did mostly the front end ""what's wrong, here is the price, etc.."" gig and found little enjoyment in it as most in depth repairs were sent off the a repair center.  I ran some programs for virus removal and shuffled paperwork, but that wasn't for me. 

My next IT related job was working for a contracted company in a warehouse environment.  For the most part, I enjoyed that job.  I setup the OS, installed software and deployed equipment and did basic bookwork of who got what asset, what happened to the old equipment, etc.  My main beef with this position was mainly the environment, as I struggle in a warehouse/blue collar environment and pay which, considering it was contracted, was subpar at best.

My current position is help desk.  There is plenty to like about this job.  I like helping people and I'm exposed to a wide array of problems.  True, many are password resets, but I like the job for the experience I get of learning how to talk with users and read what the actual problem is opposed to what they are saying.  As much as I like it, this job isn't my final end all career type job.  Talking on the phone all the time is not my thing.

I guess the purpose of my post is to get some direction on what types of jobs are out there and what direction I should head in terms of education to better myself for that field.  I feel I would do good in a break/fix environment, but I have no idea where to start in terms of what to learn, certifications, etc. 

TL;DR  The IT career field is deep and I have no clue what direction to take.

Any suggestions or advice would be great.

I could set it up for each user, but we have a little over 100 users.

**SOLUTION**

What I did was, I browsed to a users folder which I had already manually set the Homepage and installed the Add-On (Which is located at C:\Users{username}\AppData\Roaming) and copied the Mozilla folder. I pasted it into a new account I just created, and pasted it in the same location (Even though the folder did not already exist) and it pulled everything across!!!!

What I did to fix any new users that hadnt previouslly logged on to the Terminal Server:
I physically made an AppData folder, and inside that folder, made a Roaming folder, and then pasted the Mozilla folder that I had previously gotten from another user who was set up. I done this for the Public, and Default (which is hidden) folders within the Users folder on the root of C:\

So to be perfectly clear, inside the C:\Users folder on the Terminal Server (Windows Server 2008 R2 x64), there will be all the users folder's who have logged onto the Terminal Server. There are also two defualt folders, called Defualt (which is hidden), and Public. Within these folders, I MADE an AppData folder, and inside that folder, made a Roaming folder.

I'm thinking I want to create something that will auto login to each RDP session (I was thinking a batch file, but it needs to login to multiple RDP sessions AND input login credentials, so that may be out of the question), and then login to a special account that I will set up on each server that will autorun something that will check for updates, install them, run a reboot batch file, and log off (this logoff can be skipped if need be).

My question is what is the best way to go about this? I want it as lightweight as possible. Right now, I'm thinking of just using batch files all around, but I'm not sure if I can make it so one batch file would be able to logon to multiple RDP sessions, and if I could, I'm not sure how I would get it to input login credentials. Also, I have no idea how to automate the windows update process. Since installing updates requires an 'enter,' and batch files can't send keys, I'm looking at maybe writing something in VBasic.

Anyone have any ideas? Also, we're running Server 2003 and 2008.

Thanks!

 - Call the company and see if they have some sort of disk or something.
 - Buy Win7 operating system and just format and install it.

If I format it though, what should I do about all the drivers I'll need. I worked on a 10 year old computer once, and it required ethernet drivers....... I really don't want to deal with that shit again. Since the computer is only a year old do you think it won't need that driver?

She asked how much and I told her since she was a teacher and a friend of the family I would do it for $30 (dirt cheap IMHO).

Already messaged her with an update that it wasn't looking good but I am about to give up for the night.

If you're interested in that thread, it's [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/1jw729/frustrated_from_trying_to_land_a_help_desk_gig/).

First off, thank you to everyone who responded to that thread.

Now, the update: 

I got a call back from an IT staffing agency about a job as a helpdesk level 1 for a PBX phone-service company. My primary duty would be supporting end users with that service, but the company does a lot of other services as well, such as cabling and internet service providing. I got an in person interview and absolutely nailed it, and they say they are stopping their search with me for now and just need the VP to sign off on an official offer. 

However, I got a call back from a place that I applied for that I think is probably a slightly better fit. It's a computer consulting firm that basically offers a vast array of IT solutions and provides help desk support to clients post-install. I had a phone interview with them, it went really well, and I just got back from an in person interview. They say they have kind of a drawn out interview process to try to get to know the candidate.. I'm guessing there is going to be at least one more interview, if not two. I think I did really well in that interview too, and I feel like there is more opportunity for advancement in this place. Both companies are growing, but company B just moved into a brand new place (which was beautiful and huge) and are probably growing faster. 

The problem is, the first job (let's call them company A for future reference) pays a dollar more an hour, and is only 10 minutes from my house. It's a 3-6 month contract-to-hire position, but they strongly hinted that I would be offered a full time position if I did a decent job, which I'm pretty sure I would. The timetable for this job interview/acceptance process is going to be a lot faster than company B. 

Company B is a straight full time position and offers full benefits after 90 days, but it's about 25+ minutes away from my house. Their interview process is much more drawn out, which I wouldn't have a problem with if I didn't have this other job sitting here waiting. 

Knowing my situation and how it's taken me about a month and a half to even get call backs, I'm not sure how picky I can be. If I turn down company A, and company B ends up not offering me the position, then I'm right back to square one and I will feel like a complete dunce. 

Should I call company B and tell them to hurry up, or is that something that they may not want to hear? I kind of got the feeling like they don't really want to be rushed in their decision. or should I call company A and risk telling them that I want to hold out for an offer from company B? I feel like that's a huge risk as well.

I just don't really know what to do, or how to go about proper etiquette informing all parties.

TL;DR I got interviews at 2 places, basically got a job offer from one company, but I think another company whose drawn out hiring process may be a better move in the long run. Not sure if I should tell first company to wait, or just take the first offer since I've had difficulty landing a job to this point.

Would something like Microsoft Security Essentials suffice on these computers? Or is that a bad idea, is there any other recommendations of services? Or, should we just stick to NOD32 (I don't even know where NOD32 ranks in terms of usefulness of antivirus)

Things I'd like to be able to do:

-Stream audio from my PC to my livingroom stereo. Switch midway to my bedroom stereo with as small an interruption as possible.

-Preferably have the audio stream not be tethered to files, but the sound from the computer (so I could stream Pandora/Spotify etc.)

-Stream movies/video to my TV (with the same room-switching abilities above preferably)

-Been thinking about Bluetooth so I can stream stuff from my phone too. This is something I'd like, but not a deal breaker.

Anyone have any suggestions?

I'm about to graduate with a Creative Writing bachelor's degree into an awful economic climate, and the reality of that is really sinking in. I got an email today informing me of the Masters in Information Technology program at my school, saying that it is only a 32 credit-hour program. I could potentially do that in one year including summer semesters, and it's a very appealing idea to be qualified in such a useful field.

I have no formal training with computers but, like a lot of people who grew up in the internet age, I have a decent grasp on how to use them (when I took a required basic technology course last year, for instance, it was all stuff that I had known for a long time.) I am generally good at school; I have about a 3.8 GPA and have gotten A's even in subjects that I'm not particularly skilled at, like math.

I'm sure many of you have a Masters in IT-- how difficult do you think that would be for someone like me? Would I simply be unable to do it without prior training? I know that programs vary from school to school, but I would guess that mine is about average-- a 32 credit-hour program at a very large state university.

Working with so many machines on a daily basis, screwups are bound to happen.

Mine happened like this:
Client in the medical field, had a pair of $20,000 machines that were controlled by vendor-provided Dell laptops. Not irreplaceable, as we could install the software and hardware attachments on any laptop, but considered very important as these machines were needed on a regular basis for diagnostic procedures billed at $2000/patient.

So I had laptop A, did some routine maintenance on it, and went to client site to drop it off and pickup laptop B. As I'm getting in my car I reach in to move something out of the way so I can stick my  laptop behind my seat where it usually goes. Then I drive away to visit a vendor just a few minutes away.

When I get to the vendor and exit my car I look in the back seat and realize that laptop B isn't there. The horror. In a near-panic I search my entire car, under seats, in the trunk, all the places I knew it couldn't be as it should just be in the back seat.

I realize that when reached into my back seat to adjust things I had put it down in the parking lot next to my car. And left it there. And possibly ran over it when I was backing out. And it may have been stolen by now.

I jump back in my car and speed the entire way back. I thought about calling the secretary but the thought of asking her to search the parking lot for the possibly crushed laptop, and the shit I would catch if the management heard about it made me decide against it. I just prayed it would still be there.

When I get back to the parking lot, I don't see the laptop. Fuck. Did it get stolen already? It's been out here 15 minutes. I see a middle aged manager type walking around the parking lot holding a laptop case. Sweet jesus yes thank you. It's the laptop. I walk up to him and say ""Excuse me sir.."" and get the laptop back. He had just pulled in and seen it. If he had given up and gone to his office there would have been no way for me to find him, and the laptop didn't have any identifying information on it.

My guess is that her laptop came installed with Leopard (10.5), and I can't do a fresh install with the Snow Leopard (10.6.3) disc that she gave me.

While I'm at it, since I don't have much experience with Macs, how can I become an expert at Macs?

At my job right now (sales/logisitics for a clothing company) I spend about 50% of my time working on IT issues and have become the default ""Computer Guy"" for our office. Because of this, I have found that I enjoy working on computers, feel very comfortable doing so, and would enjoy the opportunity to make it a career. Additionally, I have always built my own computers, and have dabbled in more than a few programming languages for fun. 

Can anyone give me advice on how to get into this field? I have a B.S. in Business (great unintentional pun) from a good university and I'm thinking of signing up for CCNA certification. Any other certifications I should look for? What about job postings or desired positions? Lastly, just any advice from an inside look would be appreciated. 

Note: I would really like to go into networking, but am open to any other IT related field if you guys think it would be promising to look into.

I am a recent graduate with a bach. in Software dev. At the moment I have an internship going (unpaid :(   ) so I figured a good way to get some money on the side (afternoons/weekend jobs) would be to start up a simple little home pc shop.

I have done small to medium repairs on my own and family computers for free over the years, but I do not know if I want to include any kind of larger repair service (do not have the $ to afford startup gear if its a hardware issue). What I did plan on including though is the following:

* Home network setup
* Virus/maleware removal
* Custom builds
* Data Transfer
* Software installation (eh...we have a large group of elderly people here)
* Recommend with what budget you have what desktop/laptop to buy

After I get some initial funds from doing a few jobs, maybe it would be a good idea to then invest in tools for repair jobs (PS testers etc). I have a usb-sata-ide already that I borrow from a friend, and I already have a generic toolkit of screwdrivers and zipties/cutters. 

I figured a flat rate for most jobs would work good, and with the custom builds I would get a budget, and then collect a percentage     (enough to cover the parts if I have no budget to work with) ahead of time, and then the rest after completion. If I did get into repair, Id probably charge 30-40 an hour to undercut the local (hugely overpriced) store that has 2-3 employees working there. I applied back there when I was 19 looking for a summer job, back then it was....nasty to say the least. 

Flyers will be put in the 2-3 grocery stores within the 2-3 towns around here. Will be ordering business cards and setting up with Google Voice. Anything else you guys can think of that I am missing that I could include/need to do? Hopefully this is in the correct subreddit. Thanks for your time!

My laptop HD is failing, I coudn't get past the Windows logon screen, it loaded way too long. I booted Ubuntu Live 11.10 and I could actually browse my files. 

Right now, most of my files (except my music) I copied over on a small portable USB HD but before I resorted to that option, I tried copying the files over on a shared folder on a Windows PC in this network. I also tried making the folders I wanted on my failing laptop HD shared.

After I did that, the Windows PC couldn't get in the Ubuntu laptop, because the folders had certain permissions. So in the shared window, I checked everything so all permissions were granted. Now the Windows PC didn't ask for a password anymore, but it did gave an error: Can't connect to UBUNTU or something like that. 

The music folder I connected to was present in the 'My Computer' screen on the Windows PC, but because I couldn't get in and decided I would just use the USB HD instead, I deleted the folder from 'My Computer'.

What I didn't know was, I accidentely DELETED EVERYTHING INSIDE MY MUSIC FOLDER CONSISTING OF 14.000+ SONGS.

tl;dr
1. Windows laptop HD fails, cannot get past logon screen
2. put Ubuntu Live 11.10 boot cd in laptop, manage to browse my files
3. make folder with said files shared using Ubuntu Live 11.10 boot cd
4. Windows PC sees shared folder made in Ubuntu Live 11.10 boot cd
5. Windows PC cannot connect to said folder
6. I delete the folder from Windows PC's 'My Computer'

I usually order from two major wholesalers locally (Spain), but the few drives they show in stock are insanely marked-up. 1 Tb's seemto be in especially short supply. I found a few at reasonable prices, drives that were rebranded oddballs, upgrades and the such. An example are a a handful of Lenovo 1 TBs (7200), some MemUp, and Storex. These drives seem to fly below the radar. Also, I'm thinking of buying up a few externals in the 1, 1.5, and 2 Tb sizes, although I'd probably be getting 5400 greens, and there is the issue of warranty...

TL;DR: If you can't get reasonably priced drives, look for rebranded drives or externals.

Oh, a warning: WD My Passports SE have a custom board with no SATA header. They are full-on USB 3.0. I imagine that to get standard drives it would be best to stick to non prime manufacturers.

OH, BTW, If you have to use externals, and don't want to void the warranty, want to keep them outside, but have them go full speed, look for eSATA/USB combos. They have fallen out of favor, but they provide a cheap solution. eSATA back plates are cheap, an all motherboards support SATA.

I have seen this error caused by DNS before. A quick ipconfig /all showed me this.

Even though the workstation is set to DHCP from the SBS server at 192.168.1.2 it is using the wrong DNS (it should be using the SBS server). Preformed a release and renew, and got the correct DNS server showing in ipconfig instantly. Reconencted to the domain without issue. Then I ran a few malware scans figuring I had a DNS hijacker. Removed some found malware and left assuming the problem was resolved. 

I got called back two days later for the same issue. Ipconfig showed the same results as before. I double check my DHCP server to make sure its configured to hand out the right DNS. I also verify that the workstation in question has an active lease. Then I haul out process explorer and process monitor along with my rootkit tools, but find nothing of interest on the workstation. 

This acts very much like a rogue DHCP server on my network, but I can’t have a rogue DHCP server because …

* 1.	The windows DHCP server is running and working correctly. It would have shut down if it detected another DHCP server on the same network. 
* 2.	The workstation has an active lease showing on the windows DHCP server.
* 3.	IPconfig lists the DHCP server clearly as 192.168.1.2

Right ? Well no. Completely wrong as it turns out. Logging into the Linksys E300 router I discover that DHCP is in fact enabled with the DNS servers I encountered. After questioning the staff I am told that a technician for the ISP was upgrading their service recently and changed settings in the router (apparently enabling DHCP in the process). 

**tl:dr** XP workstation accepting and using only the DNS settings from a rogue DHCP server even though ipconfig reported it was using the proper domain controllers DHCP server. 

I am unsure what lessons to take away from this, anyone have any thoughts or similar experience ?

Acronis told me the clone went fine, put in new drive into original system, and I get the blue dell banner and something about loading something ""2"", and then hang. Tried this 3 times, and several times, acronis told me it failed, I think twice said it was fine. Each time I reformatted/repartitioned the drive.

I tried Ghost, and it said it worked fine...3 times. Each time, I either get ""error loading kernel"" or the ""loading p(something, I forget the acronym)"" and then hang. Google tells me Ctrl+F11 here starts system restore. I don't WANT THAT.

I tried Clonezilla from boot disc, said it worked FINE, same error. I ran spinrite on the entire drive, said 0 errors.

I finally reformatted, used an OEM recovery disc to reinstall, and copied over data minus programs.

I'm guessing maybe I had some sort of damage in the mbr or something of the master disk, but it ran flawlessly on its own. I've cloned probably a hundred drives, even drives with recovery partitions, with no errors ever in the past. I'm assuming the cloned disk had sector pointers that were incorrect.

I even tried Falcon4's ""dell mbr fix"", and it told me it couldn't help me because my values were wrong.

* Setting up a new PC for them.  We have a wide range of job functions here, most of which require specialized software.  I've included everything I can in the system images that I use, but almost universally a user will need additional software installed.  Further to that, setting their mail up, their home directories, etc, requires that I log in as them.

* Diagnosing an issue local to their PC (presuming they aren't around).  Some issues are going to be with their profile specifically and won't be system-wide, so it's often necessary to log directly in as a user.  If they're around, I'll get them to do it, but if not, I will usually get their password from them beforehand or via text message or something.

How can I get around these scenarios?

Here's the story: I'm working on a RAID 0 array after booting to an Ubuntu live cd, transferring files from the array to an external disk. The array and two disks it consists of are fine, no corruption or failure.

While transferring files, I noticed the Users folder was massive (my profile over 400 GB from video editing), so I decided to skip copying that as I wouldn't be able to fit that and everything else onto the external disk at one time.

Once the copy was done, I deleted everything but the Users folder from the array. I go to copy the users folder to another external disk, and it's now only a few hundred kilobytes, vs 400+ GB. What gives?

I'm thinking I may have inadvertently deleted something, so I need some help with undeleting files from a RAID 0 array (2x 1 TB disks) in Ubuntu.

I've google'd the issue, and all tutorials use a single drive, not an array. I try typing /dev/mapper/nvidia_jecacfcg1 instead of /dev/sda1, or whatever their example is, and all I got was:

The text reads: 

&gt;Why must I absolutely and always reformat my SD cards?

&gt;The reason I am asking, is that I was a volunteer photographer at a local festival. And with brand new SD cards and a shiny D7000, I rounded my 10.000th frame only to discover that a few had becometh rainbows instead.

&gt;After much empathy and reassuring talks with the other photographers, we came to the conclussion that I had never formatted the cards, and I reasoned why I should?

&gt;Now I know, that formatting my card is important. But the exact reason why leaving that out, would destroy a frame or 7, is beyond me?

I’m still having problems with imgur, however, I do not think showing an image with 40% pink lines is going to help much.

I have since reformatted my card and shot 750 frames, just to be sure. And I have yet to see a single broken image. So regurlar quick-formatting keeps everything working. And why is that? 

A few of the pro's I talked to, mentioned that they format their cards everytime they start a new shoot, just to check the cards for errors.

He had taken his old computer's hard drive and put it in a cheap Chinese external enclosure.   It worked fine for a couple years until the power supply on that began to have intermittent failures, which damaged the hard drive. Even inside our test machine, it was having a heck of a time transferring files via drag-and-drop in windows and linux, so I figured this would be a perfect time to give ddrescue a try.  I had heard about it  in late January in this subreddit.

we were able to pull an almost perfect image off it in ddrescue, however, and then simply used 7zip to pull the files out of that image.  I'm sure there is a more sophisticated recovery method for extracting the good data from the image, but this actually worked quite well, as it appears the damage to the hard drive was rather minimal (in which case I'm not sure why it was being so flaky in windows and linux) 

But anyway just wanted to give that utility a shout-out and my highest endorsement.  I didn't even have to get into setting the amount of retries (we just used the -n switch) or worrying about splitting blocks of data, or skipping areas of the disk, etc.   Though I think those would have come in handy with a more badly failing hard drive.

She needed the files for her new computer and decided to go with a program called SpiderOak. They offer 100GB worth of storage space for $5/mo.

First of all, let me say that this service is *ridiculously* slow. It took it almost two hours to upload 2GB. Their [very own FAQ](https://spideroak.com/faq/questions/1/how_long_will_the_backup_take/) says that you should only expect to be able to upload around 10-15GB per 24-hour period.

Now onto what I found.

I was trying to upload a file that SpiderOak said was 290.49MB. Just for kicks, I decided to check the file's size on my HDD. I found out that the actual size is 277MB. Interesting. But wait! What's this?! [290,485,789 bytes?](http://i.imgur.com/xNVen.png) That sounds familiar. Oh yeah. 290.49MB.

So apparently SpiderOak considers a gigabyte to be 1,000MB when it is in fact 1,024MB. This may not sound like much, but think about this.

$5/mo. for 100GB worth of storage.

100GB @ 1,024MB per GB = 102,400MB

100GB @ 1,000MB per GB = 100,000MB

So the way SpiderOak calculates a gigabyte actually costs you 2,400MB, or about 2.34GB.

It's late here. Did I do something wrong? Am I missing something? If everything I've done is correct, how are they getting away with this?

Edit: Just to add a bit more, I did these file size checks on a couple other files, and they all showed the same evidence.

Edit 2: I just found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/mef5e/somebody_please_explain_this_gibibyte_thing_to_me/) and my brain exploded. I had no idea that what I'm so used to calling a gigabyte is actually a gibibyte, and that what I'm seeing in Windows are actually IEC prefixes.

As I understand it, 1 GiB is 1,024 MiB, and 1 GB is 1,000MB. I never even knew there was a distinction. TIL.",,False,,t5_2soz7,True,,,True,t3_q6izv,http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/q6izv/interesting_thing_i_just_discovered_with_an/,

* Do you often conduct repairs while seated, seated in a high stool, or standing?

* What does your current repair workspace consist of? (pics welcome!)

* How do you handle static electricity? Have you lost any parts to static?

* Do you repair computers professionally or as a hobby?

To achieve this I will be taking the following steps over the next few days:


***Moderators***


I'll be needing two moderators with the following qualifications:

* 
Must be doing some kind of technician work in a professional capacity.

* 
Will be available at least 2 times a week to check on the subreddit.

* 
Have a overall professional candor about them. (I don't mind mods having a discussion about their methods, tools, etc., but I want to keep the overall tone of this sub civil/professional).

Optional weighted qualifications:

* 
Knowledge of how to edit the style sheet for a subreddit.
* 
Web design knowledge

I may even add a third mod simply for the two above qualifications.

Since we are not that large yet, modding this subreddit should not be to much of a hassle, but I understand that a lot of us are professionals that have other obligations. 
All of this will be taken into account when selecting a mod. 

Please message me via ""message the moderators"" with your request to become a mod. 
I will need some proof that you are a professional before I elevate you to mod status. I will let you know what you will need once you message me. 
I will also use other criteria to chose candidates that I will not display here. Thanks in advance to anyone who applies for wanting to help this community.


***Tone***


I would like this subreddit to have a mostly civil/professional tone. All are welcome, but if one is not a professional, please don't present yourself as one.
Everyone's been great so far, and I doubt we'll have any issues with this in the future. 

As explained below, I'll be working on a way to vet pros so that this won't be an issue.
Maninly, I want everyone to be able to share their tips, tricks, solutions, and experiences, and for us to be able to have fun and learn from one another.

***Computertechs Page***

I do plan on personalizing this subreddit. Since I'm more of a hardware/software guy than a web guy, I'll need some help on this end. Mainly with the CSS style sheet for the page.
Also, I would like to be able to vet professionals by putting a symbol beside their name if they've shown to be professional technicians in any capacity. 
Again, if I don't get a mod, I'll need help with this as well.

Also, I will be updating the side panel with related subreddits, tools, websites, other things I may think about, and your suggestions. I will be making a separate post for that though.
Please don't hesitate to jump over to [user suggestions for r/computertechs](http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/j79df/user_suggestions_for_rcomputertechs/) with any suggestions you may have for this subreddit. 

Thanks again to anyone that has contributed these past couple of days, and to anyone that has frontpaged us.

I've looked at proprietary software like MODES and Adlib and the cost seems to be prohibitive. On that basis, I'd really appreciate some insight from someone who has experience with either CollectionSpace or CollectiveAccess, which seem to be the two dedicated open-source options.

I've loved working with computers all my life, built my own PC for gaming, generally have been the go-to guy with all my friends/relatives when it comes to troubleshooting computers. 

That said, I'm ready for a change. I've got an associate's in Business Computer Systems and Management, which doesn't really mean anything nor did it teach me much that I didn't already know about computers, but I suppose any degree is better than none. 

I'm looking to get into Desktop Support to start because I am fairly certain this would be my ""best"" area to start, but eventually want to move to virtualization/VMware as I've read that's the ""future"" of IT and obviously want to be a part of that wave. 

Anyways, now that I've gotten all that rambling behind me, I'm just wondering if any of you have any study tips/resources that have helped you earn your certifications. I've already got the MCTS 70-680 Cert Guide written by Don Poulton, which was recommended on here whilst I was lurking a few months back, and I'm liking it alot so far.

I've landed my first real business client and I want to do this right. 

His business has CCTV, box is in the closet running to his router via CAT5 in his office.

The people that set it up did some work on it, had to keep from laughing as I was inspecting it all. Apparently they didnt want to crimp CAT5 jacks on the ends of this 85ft cable so they cut a normal 2ft cat5 cable and SPLICED it onto the 85 footer! They seperated the ends well enough but only used masking tape to protect the exposed wires. I'll take some pictures next time I'm there in a few days to show you, its quite a site! On top of that, his business is a auction house in a outdoorsie type barn, and the cable is totally exposed, has been eaten through by mice.

Anyways, I cant run powerlines from the closet where the CCTV is because there is no available power jack to plug into. I want to use a LAN to wifi converter/adapater to connect the CCTV box to his router. There is a power strip that runs through the wall into a wall jack that I can plug this into, the wall jack is just not practical to plug a powerline into, incase I have to go in and reboot it, I would spend half a hour moving stuff to get to it.

I've looked at amazon and found these two devices:

So what is the deal?  There is no way for the whole drive to have been formatted between the time that she said it stopped working and when she gave it to me.

That being said, I can probably get one of them for either dirt cheap ($20 or so) or probably even free.  In that case, I was thinking it might be worth trying to reflow and turn it into a cheap little HTPC with xbmc or something on it.  Just for kicks and giggles.

What do you folks think, worth a shot?  Would be minimal investment.   Would I be better off buying a heat gun or just using my apartment oven?  The latter method i'm only out my time and whatever I spend on the laptop itself.

I work on laptops at work insofar as RMA work, swapping system boards, etc (I'm HP certified but work on both HP and dell fairly confidently) but this ""oven"" method sounds totally crazy.  That said, I'm really curious to see if it can work!",,False,,t5_2soz7,False,,,True,t3_qv3hn,http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/qv3hn/ghettoreflow_a_gpu_using_an_oven_can_it_really/,

I understand how computers work, and love all aspects of IT (especially networking).

I was just hired for my first formal IT job. I'm going to be sort of a jack-of-all-trades IT guy for a company and I was wondering if anyone had any pointers/tips?

Just anything you wish you'd known when you started. Really anything is acceptable; like I said, I'll be handling pretty much anything that's thrown at me.

Thanks!

See I live in Canada and there is some content on the internet that is restricted to U.S. I.E. full tv shows from broadcasting websites and streaming website with copyright content; Pandora being one of those. I can't access Pandora from home, which is normal, but here is the thing. For about a month I was able to access Pandora.com from work. I tried logging in before but was granted with the usual ""this content is restricted to U.S. IP addresses"" but now it works just fine. I had co-workers to try it too and it also worked. So basically my question is: Why does it work if our IP address is located in Canada?
