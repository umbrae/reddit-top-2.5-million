1369739558.0,371,self.Warframe,1f6yl8,PSA: You are probably not using your sentinel correctly.,421,50,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1f6yl8/psa_you_are_probably_not_using_your_sentinel/,"This is a PSA/Guide regarding sentinel AI. It applies mostly to Dethcube for reasons I will explain, but it should also apply to Wyrm and Shade.

I noticed that my Dethcube was shooting at things until they died, before reacquiring a new target, and shooting at it until it died...etc. This caused it to rarely use Vaporize, which is a great skill. The only time it vaporized anything was in the millisecond time span between shooting things - even if things were meleeing my face. I thought it was stupid, and that it should vaporize the minute anything gets within five feet of me, and shoot when it has nothing better to do. That's when I learned something.

The sentinels have a priority list of which skills they use at what times. This is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT and not very apparent in the UI. Essentially, the higher ranked skills are more important, and the lower ranked ones it does whenever it has nothing better to do. Each point on the list corresponds to a power slot in the corner of the sentinel's powers. If you have your sentinel's attack AI card in the top left corner, it gets HIGHEST PRIORITY, meaning things like saving your life with Guardian are only done when it's not shooting something. Shooting is more important. On Dethcube this is particularly bad, because it's gun never stops firing while something is in range, while the others stop occasionally.

I made an image to illustrate this point more clearly: http://content.screencast.com/users/Arsonide/folders/Jing/media/2736dcd4-d1a7-48ca-b09c-6d97e3f65df7/2013-05-28_0558.png

You will notice in my image, the correct setup has Guardian FIRST, because my life is more important than anything. Then I put vaporize, because it is the sentinel's active skill. Then Regen, though I imagine this could also be last, since the sentinel isn't firing when it is dead. Lastly, I put the attack AI card. My sentinel now vaporizes the second anything gets near me, and only attacks while vaporize is on cooldown. I also expect I'll be getting more shield refills from now on.

TLDR: Sentinels have a priority queue. Do not put your attack AI card in the top left corner, or your sentinel will perform sub-optimally...especially if it is Dethcube.

This is essentially going to render the normal warframes useless, since there won't be a reason to build them other than ease. I suggest that instead of needing to build Primes out of a helmet, a chassis and a system, you build it out of a level 30 frame of the same type (for example, a level 30 Frost frame+BP= Frost Prime).

The UI handles this by rapidly replacing the notification that is displayed, sometimes only showing the pickup you're looking for for a fraction of a second.

Why not make the text 30% smaller, and then have it propagate upwards as you pick things up, like an item pickup notification history.

With everyone scrambling for Void Keys and trying to piggyback across dimensions, I thought it would be a good idea to create a comprehensive guide on just what is inside these ancient towers. In this guide I'll cover the major rooms of interest, types of enemies, traps, and other things to make sure you get the most out of your void runs. If you catch anything I miss or have a screenshot to help illustrate a point, comment and I'll add it here.

First, let's cover what types of enemies you'll see in the tower. Enemies in the tower are re-purposed variants of the various faction's enemies. Corpus crewmen, Ancient Healers, Fusion Moas, Grineer Troopers, and Grineer Heavy Gunners are the familiar faces in the tower. [A standard Corpus Crewman](http://i.imgur.com/ZzOEAMj.jpg)

The levels of enemies vary from tier to tier.

TIER I has enemies ranging in level from ~15-~25 with enemies typically around 20

TIER II has enemies ranging in level from ~25-~45 with enemies typically around 35

TIER III has enemies ranging in level from ~50-~85 (Some as high as 100 have been spotted though) with enemies typically around 75

You'll also see reskins of the shield ospreys in the towers, or as I like to call them ""Stop fucking moving you little shithead."" They have slightly wonky hitboxes, so make sure you aim for the dead center of their eye if you have slower, more accurate weapons. [A stop fucking moving you little shithead in action](http://i.imgur.com/7Ul7cdw.jpg)

Besides the shoot bangs you see, you'll have to deal with a whole lot of traps the Orokin got from Ikea. There are Turrets, Death Orbs, and Laser Panels. Turrets function like their Corpus counterparts, except that they might pop out of bushes or out of the ground when you step on a pressure plate. Death Orbs are big round balls (duh) that will open any number of their side panels and shoot lasers at you. In addition, they can also work like shockwave moas and periodically do a groundpound. By shooting the top panel on an orb, you can stop it from moving. If you're extra pissed, you can shoot off any side panel shooting a beam to reveal a glowing vortex inside. Shoot the vortex to create a devastating explosion. Walking near an orb as a Prime Frame will replenish a large amount of energy for the entire team. [A dormant Laser Orb](http://i.imgur.com/lV7gJNZ.jpg). Laser panels are identical to the panels on laser orbs, except they move on little tracks. They can be shot off in the same way as the orbs can.

More importantly than the enemies are the treasures. Mods can and will drop from regular containers and lockers. Some containers may explode, however, so keep your distance when smashing boxes. If a mod FROM A CONTAINER DROPS pick it up immediately. It will disappear after a short duration. (credit to /u/Goth667 for suggesting this. After a few tests I determined he was right.) RED AURA MODS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

Treasures aren't always there in the open though. The Orokin are going to make you work for your money by hiding them in various rooms. I could go into detail about all the secret passages and shortcuts hidden throughout the levels, but I'll leave those for you to find and stick to ones that yield goodies.

Pressure plates are scattered all over the tower. Some are in plain sight, others blend in to the floor. Usually the plates will activate the rooms traps, or trigger a timed run. Sometimes though, the plates will open a nearby wall or floor panel with some lockers or containers inside, so keep your eye out when you step on them.

There are five major puzzle rooms I've found so far in my ~30 runs.

**THE FILIGREE ROOM**

 /u/Noneerror provided screenshots and a description.

&gt;There's also a big open area wall run room. You have to jump up on the filigree, walk to the top point and then wall run the rest of the way. Then wall run back to the side you started from. It allows you to get into [this room](http://postimg.org/image/ppvcprquf/) room.

This room is marked by the large gazebo in the center of the room. Getting on top of the gazebo will allow you to spot the landing with the goodies. [Here is another screenshot by /u/Noneerror](http://postimg.org/image/otw61fvpd/)

I have gotten up there by jumping and wall running off the pillars on the middle level balcony to grab onto the gazebo roof side. This can be done by all frames, even the slow ones, without mods. Once on top, wall run where it was shown.

**THE WATERFALL ROOM**

This is a very small puzzle room (in terms of complexity), and I didn't notice it until a recent run. This room seems to spawn more on extermination missions.

This room is very large and ornate with multiple waterfalls and pathways surrounding a raised dais in the center. [A picture of the room](http://i.imgur.com/aqGHANb.jpg).Around the central tree are four pressure plates. Pressing one of them may lead to a door opening above an upward flowing waterfall [shown here](http://i.imgur.com/blzaL2H.jpg). Jump into the waterfall while running forward to gain a bit of height. This height will allow you to wall run up the opposing wall. At the top is a small room with a few lockers and containers, as well as a pressure plate. Pressing this will open a new room that is opposite of the upward fall [shown here](http://i.imgur.com/3RtXHev.jpg). Inside here is yet ANOTHER pressure plate, although it has never been active for me, so this may be the end of the run. (After more runs I've noticed that the room that opens first may be switched. Pressing the plate inside will open the other.) /u/MrJelle notes that the upper four panels may not work. If this is the case, a lower room will usually start out opened.

**THE CLIMB**

(I added this room after getting three mod drops from it.  It has no timer or puzzle which is why I omitted it originally)

[Here is a picture of The Climb](http://i.imgur.com/JwmANeA.jpg)

Screenshot belongs to /u/Steyrboy and I took it from his post. 

This room is a large open tower with a floor covered in water, several wall panels for jumping, and a laser orb suspended on a dais in the center of the room. Wall running across the room and up is viable, albeit tricky. Much simpler is to simply walk across the water floor (it's shallow) and make your way to an alcove on the opposite end. A raising wall is here, so activate it, jump on it, then wall run with the added height up the opposing wall. From here you can easily make your way across the platforms to either side of the room which can have anywhere from 0-8 crates.

**THE RUN**

(Occasionally this room will be there, but will not be active. Simply continue as normal)

This room is pretty straightforward. A pressure plate opens a small gate for you, while also activating the rooms traps. Make your way across the cryo floors to the other side before the door closes and nab your goodies. [A picture of the run](http://i.imgur.com/0bhwntk.jpg). [A picture of the reward room](http://i.imgur.com/nUIzl3R.jpg). About halfway along the course is a small alcove in the wall [seen here](http://i.imgur.com/ukVzj8m.jpg). Wall running into this room will yield a few more lockers and crates. This room can also be used to cheat the course with a team mate. A hole in the preceding room leads here, allowing a team mate to position themselves closer to the finish before the timer activates. [The hole](http://i.imgur.com/W7ZvT1J.jpg).

Along the side of the run are two balconies that can also be used to bypass the lasers and cryo floors (Credit to /u/shiny_dunsparce for this tip)

**THE PUZZLE ROOM**


This room has no timer, so take the time to wipe out all the enemies before solving. In this room there are four stairways. The landing on each stairway has a large pressure plate that is lit by a color (/u/Khrolek says that only the host can see the color differences on the plates. Make sure they are in the room before you try solving.
). If the color is blue [as shown here](http://i.imgur.com/ivPnfwh.jpg), press it so it becomes green. If you press the wrong panel, it will turn red and will restart (or stop working). Pressing all the plates in the correct order will reveal wall panels in the middle floor above [like this](http://i.imgur.com/vtITGE1.jpg).

 [A picture of the puzzle room. Note the tree.](http://i.imgur.com/IffzL2l.jpg)

**THE PARKOUR ROOM**

(This room rarely spawns in extermination missions. I've also heard of multiple rooms spawning per run, so always explore)

[This is the entrance plate. Be sure to have the whole team with you or else pressing the following plate will lock them out.](http://i.imgur.com/j9yiVtG.jpg)

By far the most difficult and notorious room so far. Upon entering the starting room, a pressure plate will open the adjoining room. Once you enter, a SECOND plate will shut the previous door and start the timer. A THIRD pressure plate will open a small gate and allow you and your team to forge a [treacherous room filled with lasers. Note the upper paths.](http://i.imgur.com/jDrR5rg.jpg) Wall jump across this room, avoid the few lasers beyond that, jump the cryo floors, and then you have a very large treasure room ripe for looting. [The treasure room is just above!](http://i.imgur.com/63wvLac.jpg)

Some shortcuts are available in this room: 

-The waterfall in the center of one of the rooms is flowing upwards. Slide jump into it to gain some distance. ""raddude"" discovered that a secret ledge is above the water. Use this to get some more goodies [The ""water-rise""](http://i.imgur.com/IFNWeL2.jpg)

-Side paths with laser traps are available and must be taken on the return trip, and can also be used by locked out players. (Thanks to /u/redrumq for noting this. Don't stop if you get locked out by your cell!) [shown here](http://i.imgur.com/9gdV4ye.jpg)

-The final laser room can be circumvented by taking the upper path on the side. This is a FAR slower process and is usually too slow to succeed. 

-The laser panels on the floor can be destroyed like normal, but this usually takes too much time. Use this on the return trip if you're afraid of failing.

That's every thing I've discovered in the tower worth noting (besides various shortcuts, minor treasure rooms, or pathways). If you have any other rooms, major points, or pictures please comment so I can add them here (with credit of course).

Don't rush the runs, explore every nook and cranny, and enjoy the scenery for Lotus' sake!

Now get to Void Running!

1374538579.0,149,self.Warframe,1iumi6,I was banned?!,188,39,139,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1iumi6/i_was_banned/,"That is the category you have to select when you want to submit a ban appeal. I don't think humor really fits such a serious category; it's bad taste, imo. Anyway, on to my post:

A month or two back, I was banned during one of those ban waves. I submitted an appeal, and within the hour DE_Glen responded. He basically said it was a false positive and that [hardware errors](https://warframe.com/hardwarefail) could trigger their ban system. He then promptly unbanned me. This seemed likely since my old-ish laptop was not built for gaming, and I do frequently experience crashes that could be linked to hardware failures. It also seemed dumb, for the lack of a better word, that their system would be triggered by these things. On the other hand, it must be effective at catching real cheaters if they are still using it, so I didn't mind being banned, especially given the short response time.

Today, I started a new job (boooo). When I got home, I immediately hopped on Warframe to unwind after a 10 hour day. To my surprise, I was banned **again**. I was pretty frustrated, but I knew it was just another false positive and hoped DE_Glen would be on to save my day. Indeed he was on, but this time he was not here to save me. Instead, he simply said that this time it was not a false positive, that I violated their EULA and I would not be allowed any more appeals, i.e. the ban was final and he would not even say what for. I replied back and asked if he could elaborate and recheck their systems. He replied back quickly, accused me of playing innocent, and quoted one sentence from their Terms of Use:

&gt;Please note that regardless of any notice, Digital Extremes reserves the right to discontinue the Use/Service or to terminate or suspend your account at any time in its sole discretion for any reason, or for no reason.

(This type of statement shows up in most Terms of Uses, but you don't see it exercised often, at least I haven't.)

The conversation pretty much ended there. Now of course I haven't done anything wrong, unless playing too much Warframe on a low end laptop is wrong.

Now I don't expect anyone to up and quit Warframe (there's no reason to), but I hope you will take this as a cautionary tale. It seems like it could happen to anyone, and judging by other people's threads, it does.

**FINAL UPDATE:**

After reviewing and re-reviewing, and speaking with other DE team members, they have decided to unban my account :3.

-The number displayed everytime a kill occurs is experience

-When fusing mods, fusing the same mod together will give you 100% experience towards leveling it. Fusing two mods with the same polarity (the little symbols on the top right) will grant you 50% experience and fusing two mods that have nothing related will give you 25% experience. (simmobl1)

-A great planet to farm experience solo (or even in group) is Venus - Fossa. Not only do the moas give you good experience (Around 260 per kill) but you then kill Jackal for additional experience. Here's a link to my short guide : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbxX7Q4uKfk

-Red orbs give you +25 health back, blue orbs will give you +25  mana when dropped from ennemies and +50 mana when dropped from containers. Also white balls will give you +100 Affinity (Experience) for your currently equiped warframe.

-You can switch position with your Decoy using your teleportation ability (jefrejtor)

-Charge damage IS NOT increased by the Melee Damage mod

-Half of the squad must reach the end for the countdown to tick

-Blueprints look like white affinity orbs with a pink color instead.

-Some abilities will also allow you to go through lasers, like Excalibur's dash and Loki's stealth (AvidLoLFan)

-Your warframe, your main weapon, your secondary as well as your melee weapon all have individual levels. Leveling any of these will contribute to leveling your profile level (Max level warframes and weapons do not contribute to your profile level experience)

-Your profile level allows you to unlock weapons that can then be bought, the highest level required is level 7 for the ""Supra"" (weapon acquired from clan crafting system)

-Crit chance mods will not grant you as much crit chance as it is written, instead you will gain a crit chance amount equal to the base crit chance of the weapon. (7.5% base crit chance on a weapon with a 100% crit mod increases your crit chance to 15% not 107.5%)

 -Armor penetration will allow you to deal damage to enemies in areas they cannot normally be damaged and/or deal extra damage. For exemple corpus crewman will take severe damage when shot to the head with armor penetration mods

-Ancient infecteds have weakspots in their arms and legs ! (confuseray)

-Holding shift and clicking multiple mods will select them all , allowing you to sell them in a bunch (WarFuzz)

-Grineer Seekers will drop down rolling grenades that will stick to you, by rolling (tap shift) they will fall off you (azkabaal) This is also true with leech drones when they're stuck to you. (Seymor569)

-Lasers and turrets are activated by cameras on Corpus maps. If any player is seen on any camera all the lasers on the map will activate. (azkabaal)

-Tapping shift to roll as an ancient is about to hit you will prevent you getting knocked down. You can also block them.

-Pressing ""H"" will switch your camera position , which can be sometimes useful to shoot enemies from different angles. (confuseray) Tip: Rebind this key to your middle-mouse button for easy access.

1369656887.0,127,self.Warframe,1f4tqh,Dethcube and why he should not be nerfed.,156,29,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1f4tqh/dethcube_and_why_he_should_not_be_nerfed/,"Ok, so with the release of Dethcube, we see a similar occurrence as the release of Vauban. He is super popular. Everyone likes him. There is very little wrong with him, and he's actually pretty good.

Now, the history of gaming dictates that such a feature of a game MUST be balanced, and rightfully so. However, what I hope that DE realizes, is that a PvE driven game does not need nerfs if it is feasible to buff everything else to that level.

Let's think about it for a second. In LoL for example, if a champion is too powerful, a counter is found. If a counter cannot be found because the champion is just way too powerful, it receives a nerf. In such a way, imbalance is not necessarily a bad thing. Just like the Dread bow can score incredibly high crits against infested, but it is pretty weak when used against either of the other two factions (no armor ignore). The weapon might be considered overpowered against the infested, but its uselessness against the other factions makes that ok, because it still promotes using different weapons for different purposes.

Now take Ironskin (I'm not going to say whether it is in a good place right now or not because that's not what this post is about). Originally, Ironskin was useful literally everwhere. It could ignore any and all damage, and provided immunity to knockdowns. Plain and simple. Overpowered. This is a kind of imbalance that ***must*** be nerfed, because there is nothing that can overcome its power.

Ok, back to sentinels, the point of this discussion. Sentinels are not OP, not even Dethcube. Just because he is better than the other two right now doesn't mean that he should be targeted for a nerf like an overpowered ability should.

Right now, Dethcube is pretty good. He can do decent damage (for a sentinel), he has a useful and functional ability, and he is absolutely adorable (ok, that might not be a balance issue, but still, look at that twitchy little guy).

Wyrm on the other hand is not very useful. His damage is laughable unless he has the absolute best mods available to him, his ability doesn't work, and basically everyone hates him.

Shade is good, but only for utility. His damage is pointlessly low, however his ability is good for escaping tricky situations, and before Dethcube, he was top of the pack in terms of popularity.

Now, about balancing the sentinels. What I propose, is that instead of nerfing Dethcube down to match the other two, the other two should be buffed to match Dethcube. I'm not talking flat damage, I think that Dethcube has that covered. Here are my proposed methods of making Wyrm and Shade more appealing without making Dethcube obsolete.

Wyrm:

 * Fix his stun ability already... seriously... this is just silly.
 * Give him another ability that acts like Rhino's current Ironskin. Make him taunt all enemies to attack him, and also give him damage reduction to withstand the hits.
 * The new Wyrm is a support tank. He can stun enemies for you to make short work of, or he can just make them all attack him instead, drawing the punishment away from you. Wyrm would not be used for his damage, but for his utility.

Shade:

 * Make his stealth last until after the first melee hit, so that you can have one shot of that awesome melee crit damage.
 * Have him use an ability similar to Banshee's sonar, except single target. This would create crit spots on enemies that deal extra damage if struck.
 * The new Shade is a pure support. He can make you invisible, or create targets for you to do extra damage to. Shade would be taken by people that enjoy micromanaging their damage. The ones who are fixated on getting the highest damage numbers no matter how complicated their methods.

Dethcube:

 * Right now, Deth is in a good place. However, I would give him another ability to match the other two as well.
 * Give Dethcube a damage/attack speed steroid. This would be a random burst of damage. Nothing huge, but enough that you would appreciate every time it pops.

Those are my thoughts and ideas on the situation, tell me what you think.

Edit: I accidentally a word.

**TL;DR: Wyrm and Shade should be buffed to Dethcube's level in their own way.**",,False,self,t5_2urg0,1369661452.0,,nova-flux,True,t3_1f4tqh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1f4tqh/dethcube_and_why_he_should_not_be_nerfed/,

1372708596.0,126,self.Warframe,1hg3r0,Putting more challenge into the game.,141,15,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1hg3r0/putting_more_challenge_into_the_game/,"Right now we Tenno can easily wipe the floor with what the game has to offer, and the elite among us have been able to complete defense missions up to wave 100 and beyond, fighting and killing insanely high level foes.  It's getting to the point where you have to go to great lengths to find a real challenge when you're sporting fully modded, potatoed and forma'd frames and gear.

I'd love to see more events in the game that are truly dangerous to the players.  Things that you might actually have to run from rather than blazing a trail through.

The Stalker is already one of these - it's genuinely dangerous and can kill you when it's after you.  A full team of four won't have much trouble with it, but it's a good example of what I'd love to see more of.

Here's a couple more ideas:

1.  Hyena packs.  The fluff dialogue when approaching Hyena indicates that these are 'causing trouble for Tenno in the field' and they 'hunt in packs'.  Now they do.  Anywhere from 4 to 10 of these can spawn in any Corpus mission and come after you.  Rare, but happens anytime on corpus missions.

2.  Ship self destruct.  The captain realizes the ship is lost and sets it to self destruct.  Exit before the timer ends or it's curtains for you.  Happens after completing the objective.

3.  Ship vented.  You know when you break the space glass and you start losing oxygen?  The ship captain wants to kill you and does this, putting a constant drain on your shields and then your life.  Happens after completing the objective.  Maybe you should bring those shield boost items / shield polarize ability, just in case.

4.  Phoroid attack.  Once in awhile an Infested just plain grows up mean.  Appears in infested missions anytime.

5.  Laser lockdown.  The Corpus realize you're on their ship and set the laser doors and turrets to be permanently on.  They no longer knock you back, but they do serious damage as you pass through them.  Hacking a console turns them off for 10 seconds.

6.  Enemy Horde.  An unusual amount of troops / infested are on this ship.  Constant waves of enemies start relentlessly attacking you, and they get higher-level as they do (as in defense missions).  There is no wave counter and no respite - the enemies keep coming and keep getting tougher until you fight you way to the exit or you die.

7.  The Ancient Golem.  An infested disruptor that *cannot be killed* starts coming after you.  He can be 'dropped' by killing him, but that only stops him for a few seconds as he gets back up again and resumes the chase.

8.  Stalker packs.  When one didn't do the job, send more.

9.  Hard Lock - happens when you get locked down in a room and someone destroys the hacking console (make consoles destructible).  Lotus will start working on a hack of her own, but it'll take a minute, and in the meantime you're about to get hit by an elite response team (several heavy gunners, bombards, infernos for a Grineer attack, for instance).

10.  EMP blast.  The ship lets out a pulse that disables all shields and removes all warframe energy, in conjunction with a serious attack by your foes.",,False,self,t5_2urg0,False,,excalibur-prime,True,t3_1hg3r0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1hg3r0/putting_more_challenge_into_the_game/,

- Capture missions (any)  
- Raid missions (any)  
- Defense missions (any) - depends on wave level  
- Shop  
  
The way defense missions work is that rewards are based on mobs' level in 5/10/15/... waves.
Depending on level it assigns it a tier. I don't know what the thresholds are at the moment.  

Below is a list of all the rewards you can get depending on mission type. Note that capture, raid and intel (spy?) missions aren't based on level.

Hello there Tenno. It's Kuenaimaku again to go over a couple of changes with the subreddit. A couple of tweaks here and there, and a couple of options for us to venture towards.


___

###STYLING TWEAKS
* Submit Button has been fixed and replaced with two buttons; one for each submission type.

* Added a self-post image so that readers can easily differentiate between albums, videos, and self posts.

* Added a new ""Announcement"" for people to keep up-to-date on patch version &amp; Livestreams

* Modified the ""Submit"" page to contain additional information on rules and tips:
&gt; * Fixed the tab menu positioning for submission type
&gt; * Added a rule summary in bold red above title element
&gt; * Added a on-hover event on title element to remind people to read said rules
&gt; * Added a on-hover event on text element (in self posts) to remind people to check resources first before asking a gameplay question

* Removed Flair in moderator box to prevent clutter

* **ADDED FLAIR FOR VAUBAN, VAUBAN-ESPIRIT, SARYN-HEMLOCK, AND BANSHEE-REVERB** (Frost Prime is on his way)

___

###MODERATOR &amp; RULE CHANGES

* **added** /u/BuildMyPaperHeart **as a Moderator**

* **added** /u/Shadai **as a Moderator**

* **added** /u/SirNastyPants **as a Moderator**

* We are now requiring that all reports must be accompanied by a modmail (use the link in the sidebar after reporting) to cut down on the number of false positives. If you do not comply, we will know.


___

### SUBREDDIT TRAFFIC

*Below are the traffic statistics for your subreddit. Each graph represents one of the following over the interval specified.*

* **pageviews** are all hits to /r/Warframe, including both listing pages and comment pages.

* **uniques** are the total number of unique visitors (determined by a combination of their IP address and User Agent string) that generate the above pageviews. This is independent of whether or not they are logged in.

* **subscriptions** is the number of new subscriptions that have been generated in a given day. This number is less accurate than the first two metrics, as, though we can track new subscriptions, we have no way to track unsubscriptions.

Added improved Solar Landmark system for Grandmasters.  

Expanded animation library for the Grineer (combat and ambient animations)  

MOTD now displayed in halls of the Dojo.  

Added support for /invite in chat, and inviting people who aren't on your friends list or in your clan.  

Added 2 options for consumable Fireworks items to the Market.  

Added Red White &amp; Blue color picker.  

Added game invite and add friend options to chat user list context menu.

**CHANGES:**
Doubled the length of alerts for rare rewards.  

Alert System 2.0 is live  

Stalker Bow and Paris 3D draw sounds now have fire rate multiplier.  

3D Sounds on Pistols and Sentinel now have proper mix effects.  

Improved NPC awareness transfer across host migration.  

Revised multiple melee weapon animations.  

Improved enemy waypoints on minimap to show true location instead of next closest nav location.  

Dojo pieces that are dead ends are marked as such.  

Enemies that had had elemental immunities now take regular damage, with multiplied damage for weaknesses (fire and electricity).  

Updated Warframe abilities to use energy color selected by player.
Grineer now play animation while activating security system, allowing slightly more time to interrupt.  

Improved anti-cheat detection.  

Replaced all known Corpus consoles with Grineer consoles in Grineer levels.  

Made session join failures able to identify when the failure was because the session is full; hopefuly this will make losing a void key join race a little less magical.  

Added missing sounds from Prime melee weapons (swoosh!).  

Only enemies that see the player will activate panic buttons, preventing enemies in other zones hitting activating the alarms.  

Reduced particle systems on some fog that were causing performance issues on low-end machines.
Warframe Buffs:
**Mag:**
&gt;Mag: Pull- Changed to pull all targets in front of the player.  
&gt;
&gt;Mag: Shield Polarize - Now radial instead of single target. Radial damage around enemy targets that suffer shield drain.  
&gt;
&gt;Mag: Bullet Attractor - Bullet attractors now become volatile when target dies before attractor is finished, these cause radial damage around the dead target.(needs more visual polish)  

**Rhino:**
&gt;Rhino: Iron Skin - 400,600,800,1200 damage caps. Removed timer.  
&gt;
&gt;Rhino Roar: NEW POWER: Radial damage buff for all players within range (10%,15%,25%,50%)  
&gt;
&gt;Rhino: Rhino Stomp - Rolled Radial blast and Rhino Stomp together. Rhino Stomp now does damage to enemies(150,300,500,700)  

**Volt:**
&gt;Volt: Speed: Now a radial group buff, All Tenno in a radius around the caster will get a speed and melee weapon speed increase (speed, range, duration all increase with fusion level). Range (15,20,22,25) Speed (10%,15%,25%,50%) Duration (5,6,8,10).  
&gt;
&gt;Overload: Higher damage output during entire animation.  
&gt;
&gt;Shock: Has proper chaining, fusion now increases the number of chains and the radius it looks for further chaining targets.

The reason so many people are purchasing Vauban and you're seeing him practically everywhere is because he's friggin fun to use (and send friends into orbit with). 

With many being 'one trick ponies', such as (old) rhino's iron skin, Nyx's chaos, Saryn's malt, Frost's snowglobe and Ash's smoke screen (debatable). While the others just feel lackluster, straight utility, or less capable late game.

What would you guys feel about changing up some of the frames abilities to make them unique and interesting?

A suggestion of mine would be to have unique passives across all the frames, for example: 

- Rhino cannot be knocked down, only stumbled by things that knock down other frames (shockwave moas) 

- Saryn, Ember and Volt are immune to damage by, or highly resistant to their respective elements, and are not effecting by their status effects (Volt can't be stunned by electricity, Saryn can't be poisoned, Ember can't be set on fire)

- Loki has a permanent shade effect: proximity cloak (not too sure about this one, might be a little bit OP)

- Enemies are less likely (10-15%) to target Nyx 

- Ash has a higher base crit chance on all weapons, (10%, up to 20-30% when cloaked. This might be OP by spamming spoke screen and pure dpsing bosses, i believe this can be countered by lowering his hp/sheilds/armor
to make him respectively an assassin)

- Excalibur has higher base melee damage that scales with level

- Trinity's health regenerates at a slightly higher rate than the health regen artifact (name of it escapes me right now) 

- Frost doesn't lose shields on ice levels, also his melee has a 15-20% chance to freeze a target for 0.4-0.6 seconds

- Mag's bullets slightly curve toward targets (would be devastating with something like the gorgon or grakata)

- I'm not too sure about banshee but i've mostly seen her with snipers so perhaps the further away from a target she is the more damage she does (think like 3% per 60 meters, as i said before i'm not sure about banshee so you can disregard this if you want)

- and lastly Vauban, I believe he should give his team a 10% decrease in the shield recharge delay",,False,self,t5_2urg0,1368973876.0,,excalibur-prime,True,t3_1emp9h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1emp9h/instead_of_nerfing_vauban_for_being_so_versatile/,

I also believe we should also thank DE; very rare is it that the developers are so in touch with their community.

**-Introduction and Explanation-**


In the past, the developers have stated that they want each warframe to be unique and have their own personalities. For this reason, DE created different models for each WF and different skillsets and base stats. They have even gone as far to say that they may not release opposite-gender versions of each warframe, so that they truly develop their own personality. **I believe that this is a great philosophy and I adamantly agree with this design decision.** If DE chooses to continue to follow this way of thinking, I'm sure in the near future that each player will eventually come to love each individual WF. Many currently successful games follow this design; TF2 and League of Legends come to mind. Players come to love a specific character or champion, and soon inside jokes and the like begin to grow, which are important in creating a closer community. In LoL, Riot has perfected the art of making new champions feel special; they flesh out the background, and make each champion look unique and have their own personalities. This is much harder to replicate in Warframe, as the different warframes currently have no need for back stories (YET! - I'm looking at you Primes...) and also there is no voice acting. But one facet of character design we can learn from LoL, are unique passives. While some champions share very similar passives, in most recent times, Riot has taken strides in learning to make champions feel very much different than other champions of the same role, sometimes simply by creating a unique passive. You see, in many champions, the passive dictates entirely how to play the champion. 

For example, let's take 2 similar champions of the same role: Graves and Caitlyn. These two champions are known as Ranged Attack Damage Carries, or ADC, and are known to be weak in the beginning, but if you carry them, they will carry you later. Although the two champions take the same roles, in lane they play quite differently. Graves' passive, True Grit, rewards him for being in battle by giving him more Armor and Magic resist, making him tankier as the fight drags on. Caitlyn's  passive, Headshot, makes every 6th or so auto attack deal extra damage to champions or minions. What we can derive from this is, that Graves' passive tailors him to be a champion who plays aggressively in order to get the most benefit from his passive, while Caitlyn sits back and calculates when the best time to harass. Unique Passives beget unique playstyles, and in turn create truly unique champions. 


**I highly recommend that DE take a look into creating unique passives for each Warframe.**

**-Ideas For Unique Passives-**


Although the skillsets of each individual warframe already do a great deal of work to make the gameplay and strategy of each WF to feel different, eventually they all start to feel the same. Press 1 to take out some enemies. Press 2 to do something gimmicky. Press 3 to use this ability that's sometimes better than 4. Press 4 to kill everything in a room. **I've gotten to the point where, as long as I have a good gun, I don't really care about which WF I'm using, all I really need to care about is my aim. DE needs to fix this.** By implementing unique passives, you can completely change how each WF plays.

Here are a few examples of passives I came up with; please bear in mind that I am aware some of these are basic, or some of these are inspired by LoL passives, and I am just displaying these to show how they affect a WF's gameplay.
___
**Ember**

Unique Passive: Rising Flame/Overheat/Pyromaniac. When the Ember uses an ability, the cost of its next ability is reduced by 10% energy. This stacks up to 5 times. After 10 seconds, all stacks are lost. While this passive is active, the Ember gains 50% less energy from all sources.

Current Playstyle: Right now, the Ember is a completely offensive AoE caster WF. The damage of her abilities however are minimal.

What does this change: Now the Ember is rewarded for using its skills, and a player must choose whether to go ham and spam abilities or save energy. In addition to the reward of the passive, there is a caution to it, in order to balance the mechanism. The energy gain reduction will prevent Embers from abusing its passive.

___
**Ash**

Unique Passive: Bloodthirst. When the Ash is stealthed, the Ash gains 10% of his melee damage done back as Health. Anytime, the Ash kills an enemy, it is rewarded with a stack that reduces the energy cost of his next ability by 2 energy. When the Ash uses an ability, or waits 30 seconds, he loses all stacks.

Current Playstyle: Ash can be played as a stealth WF, but because of its high stats and speed, people tend to just use him as a tanky WF that can dish out the damage. The Ash is currently in that middle ground between Loki and Rhino, where, its much much tankier than Loki, but has reduced stealth potential and less utility, and its just not as tanky as Rhino and doesn't contribute to the team as much.

What does this change: Now Ash's are rewarded for going stealth, and can use the passive to either continue to be in stealth or use his other abilities to wreck face. The Ash should be a Warframe who likes to build momentum and go on a killing spree. The Ash playstyle should be for people who just want to kill everything.

___
**Saryn**

Unique Passive: Corrosive Acid. Enemies damaged by Saryn's abilties, or melee if buffed by Contagion, have reduced Armor.

Current Playstyle: I think that the Saryn is actually in a very good place right now and has one of the best and balanced skill sets. She excels at both single target DPS as well as AoE damage. All she really needs is to be able to help the team as a whole.

What does this change: Now the Saryn is a much more valuable member of a team, especially against Grineer, Corpus and Ancients. Also, she feels much more like an Acid Queen.

___

**Mag - suggested by tharinock**

Unique Passive: Magnetic Charge. Whenever Mag uses an ability, he recharges the shields of all allies in an aoe nearby proportionate to the cost of the ability.

Current Playstyle: Mag is a support caster type character. Her biggest issue is that each of her abilities either is only occasionally useful or tends to fall off later in the game.

How does this change Mag: Mag will now be invaluable for keeping things alive. The shield recharge is hard to hit on an ally, but this splash effect can ensure some effect even if you miss. And the crush skill will be useful for turning around bad fights. Refilling everyone's shields along with a fairly long stun will be incredibly useful, and make Mag feel like a powerful support. Additionally, it will make crush useful when defending the cryopod against a swarm of ancients, since you can cc the ancients and recharge some shields in one go.

___

**Loki**

Unique Passive: Deception. For every enemy killed while stealthed, Loki's Invisibilty is extended by 1 second. This bonus is unaffected by Continuity. ""Also, when the Loki is downed, an invincible clone is placed nearby for 15 seconds. "" -Sc4r4byte

Current Playstyle: Loki is a high skill level warframe, and a master of stealth. Unfortunately he is extremely squishy.

What does this change: I think that Loki players should be rewarded for the high skill and risk gameplay. This passive will reward Loki's for playing stealth and allowing them to go on rampages. A good Loki will be able to clear entire rooms if he's good enough.
___
**TL;DR - Unique Passives will beget unique playstyles, and in turn will create unique warframes.

Now I'll try to explain why that happens.  

First, remember my previous topic where I posted all the percentages for rewards. I sorted that list alphabetically but in its original state, it's sorted however developers want. I'll post the list unsorted for Tier 3 defense rewards:  
&gt; Hellfire: 18.97%  
Heated Charge: 18.97%  
Convulsion: 3.16%  
Deep Freeze: 0.15%  
North Wind: 0.15%  
Shocking Touch: 0.15%  
North Wind: 0.15%  
Hellfire: 18.97%  
Stormbringer: 3.16%  
Cryo Rounds: 0.15%  
Split Chamber: 0.15%  
Barrel Diffusion: 0.15%  
Hell's Chamber: 0.15%  
Stretch: 0.15%  
Redirection: 3.16%  
Streamline: 18.97%  
Enemy Sense: 3.16%  
Enemy Sense: 0.15%  
Rush: 0.15%  
Focus: 3.16%  
Banshee Helmet Blueprint: 3.16%  
Banshee Chassis Blueprint: 0.15%  
Banshee Systems Blueprint: 3.16%  
Orokin Tier 3 Extermination Key: 0.15%  

The order of these items is important in a way. When you enter a defense mission (let's assume high level so you start at Tier 3), you get a random seed. Depending on that seed you get a value between 0 and 1 (from now on initial seed).
After completing 5th wave, you get a reward. Initial seed now determines what you'll get. The way it works is this:  
1. Create an interval between 0 and 1 consisting of all the possible rewards (notice the sum of % is 1)  
    * In this case, Hellfire = 0.0-0.1897, Heated Charge = 0.1897-0.3794, etc.  
2. Now find out where your initial seed fits in, and that's the item you'll get.  

On the next checkpoint (this case 10th wave) depending on the seed you'll get a new random number. This new random number will be added to the initial seed. That is if your initial seed was 0.5, the interval picking number will be 0.5 + random. Now what is important is this ""random"" value is the same for every checkpoint after. 15th wave would be 0.5 + random + random.

With this knowledge and the loot table, you can figure out what your initial seed was and on 10th wave figure out what the increment is (approximately). By extension, you can calculate approximate chance to get what you wanted.  

Example:  
* You start a defense mission.  
* At wave 5 you get Heated Charge. Now you know your initial seed was between 0.1897 and 0.3794.  
* At wave 10 you get Heated Charge again. Now you know your increment was approximately (between 0 and 0.1896 or between 0.8104 and 1).  
* Since orokin tier 3 key is the last in the table, to get to it you would have to play for at least 4 more checkpoints (20 waves).  
* If your increment is big the chance to hit 0.985 - 1.0 interval is really small.  

Example sequence:
&gt; 0.93  
0.14  
0.35  
0.55  
0.76  
0.96  
0.17  
0.38  
0.58  
0.79  
(rounded)

I hope this explained why you might be getting the same reward multiple times and why low % rewards are so rare. This should also explain why defense rewards don't scale with levels.

Boss drops looking like affinity orbs is NOT acceptable. It is why I am doing the mission. I do not want to miss it by chance. It should be something unique, big, glowing, flashing, noticeable.

1. Boss drop blueprint MUST show up on the rewards screen. Given the drop name is on your screen for 5 seconds right after you pick it up, sometimes I have to go to my foundry to check what I got after the mission.

1. This is minor and a smaller issue, but I would like to see how much of each resources I farmed during the mission.

1. My teammates names and *warframe names* must be present on a corner of the screen. I would  want it always but z-screen is good too. I want to know what are my teammates packing; if there is no Volt I know the shield was put down by Hyena, if there is a Banshee I should wait for the sonar before hitting the boss, if there is a Nyx I should not kill that mind-controlled Ancient. No I cannot tell the warframe type from a grayscale portrait.

1. Roll and Sprint should be separate keys. It is not a big deal most of the time, except when I am *reloading* or *charging my bow*, want a mini-sprint, and end up rolling. Also, please dont roll me automatically after jumping down. I was done 80% reloading, but I was running down stairs and the game decided it is a fall and I should roll and now I have start my 2 second reload from the start.

1. I want the mission type (Assassination/Raid/Sabotage) always on one corner of my screen. It is easy to forget what was my objective.

1. Minor point: When I break a container dont make the drops jump 5 miles away. They often drop into the abyss, it is PITA to run around and collect them trying to figure out which nook they decided to hide behind.

1. This is a separate discussion, but screen shake needs to be toned down, *especially* the friendly ones. It does not add immersion, it is not fun, it is annoying to the point of giving me a headache. Screen shake due to an enemy to throw your aim off is kinda fine though annoying. Screen shake due to an ally spamming fragor (sometimes from 3 rooms away) is *infuriating*. If I wanted a bunch of people to stop playing Warframe, I will join their game and spam hammer melee. Why should I be penalized for a teammates actions anyways ?

**Weapons!**
New Melee weapons - Ether swords, Ether Duel Swords, Ether dagger, possible Ether duel dagger

New gun: Duel Viper

Throw-able weapons, Daggers and Shuriken confirmed

Confirmed for future: Laser weapons!

**For warframes!**

New frames in the works, non shown off yet.

Ability changes for ASH number 1 with the implementation of throw-able weapons, and changes to his teleport so that he will appear behind enemies due to the implementation of Stealth attacks last update.

Confirmed, that much later in the future, we will be able to give our frames new abilities not currently available.


**MODS!**

Rarity above Rare has been confirmed, but are in the reserves for a undetermined point in the future.

Confirmed knock back mods, that will allow us to get up quicker

**STAGES!**

New tile sets (around 6-11 I believe?) for Corpus asteroid base missions.

New tile sets for Corpus outside world missions.

Confirmed that new music is in the works or shall soon be under way.

**GENDERS!**

They hinted at this, but there was talk of Ember/Blaze. Unsure at this time.

**PvP!**

Confirmed that they still are not working on PvP at this time.

**New bosses, new stalker bosses, new factions?!**

New bosses in the works, one confirmed to replace the current Saturn boss, Golem with a new design.

They hinted at possible new hidden fun stuff like the Stalker, but did not go into detail.

Confirmed new factions, though they may not arise in update 8
****
**LORE?!**

Animator Designer Geoff is in the works of a new trailer for the game, that will supposedly also include new lore!

**CLANS!**

Confirmed pooling of resources for clans. 

Confirmed Gifting (seems to be only Platinum gifting atm)

Confirmed Clan leaderboards and list of existing clans

Confirmed that clans shall be able to create their own dojo's that will take resources, plat/credits to create. In this dojo, we shall be able to design it with cool stuff, and tile sets straight from the missions we go on. You shall be able to invite friends outside of the clan, into the dojo if you wish

Possible Clan quests/missions

Confirmed Clan vs Clan! (Not PvP). It seems that it will have a RISK type gameplay, where clans will fight for control of territories, how that will play out is unknown.


**PETS!**

New pets have been confirmed, though prbly will not show up in update 8.

New pet skills, such as being able to hack terminals has been confirmed.

New pet customization! (make em look pretty or something)



EDIT: Stuff I forgot to mention

**RESETS!
**
We will not be getting resets this upcoming update 8. But they did explain what the reset will entail. Pretty much you litterally lose everything. All frames will be taken away minus w.e starter you choose. All weapons minus the Vandels (Lato vandel and Braton Vandel) will be taken, same with mods, and even our precious potatoes (the orkin cata and reactors). They only thing we get to keep is that any plat we ever spent will instantly be refunded. That's it. Not even resources. And this is a permanent, one time thing, so if you decide to do it, but afterwards, you want to go back to how you were, you are screwed, due to the data either being completely gone, or simply to hard to track down. 

Also, forgot to mention that another throw-able weapon included will be the famous Glaive!

Finally, we are unsure when update 8 is going to be out, but we will be getting a update this friday, most likely containing the Ether weapons, and Duel vipers, with some probable fixes.

Oh, and on the topic of fixes, they shall be working on the server issues, changes to Global chat to make font better, and looking at player names on the chat bar side easier/better.


OH! almost forgot again

Confirmed new game mode, Capture! Not sure what it entails, but it's there. Also change to normal gameplay, in order to stop assholes who simply run through, leaving lower leveled players/ people going slow behind, they have made it so that you cannot start the mission complete count down until at least half the team is at the extraction point. They also plan on some changes for when people DC after they have beaten a boss in order to stop the host migrations and stop people from losing their items.


EDIT 2: Crap, forgot a very big thing with weapons (possibly frames too) in the future!

They talked about being able to prestige (like in call of duty) with weapons, so once you reach max level, you can prestige it. The point of prestige-ing is so that you can unlock another polarity slot of your choice, enabling for even more/better mods!



EDIT 3: DAMNIT! I keep forgetting important things &gt;_&gt;

Just remembered, a important topic!

**STEALTH SYSTEM!** 

They had talk about soon making the stealth system much better when many other things are finally done. One such change that we can expect (not with update 8 though) is that one day, we will be able to turn off the alarm system, thus returning all enemies back to a non-alert mode! Much like Metal Gear solid, if you stay hidden long enough and such.

Also, for those interested in more Parkour oriented levels, we will not be seeing those for a long while until they fix/better the current parkour system. This is because to many people are either bad/unfamiliar with it, and that it can be pretty buggy, so having to be forced to progress on those types of levels will bring endless frustration

Personally I'd like to see it reworked or removed all together.
Best of all was if it were optional, but award more of a reward. For example on raid missions that give a guaranteed mod, it now gives two. Or perhaps it adds resources common from that area? 

Perhaps a vote that the players can decide if to continue or to head for the exit.

It's a small change that, in my opinion would better the game. For example, if I'm rushing through a potato alert because I don't have much time to play, the last thing I want to hear is ""This just got interesting.. "". By making it an optional feature the players them self could opt to head straight for the exit or take the longer path for added reward. 

Also from a RP perspective it would make more sense for the Lotus to prioritise the main objective, that is after all why we went there in the first place. Adding second objectives only endanger the first one. The objective change completely in the event of more valuable intel, but when the new main objective is complete, make the old one a optional secondary.

I love Warframe, I have a level 7 account, and have tried many of the frames including the top tier ones - Vauban , Banshee etc.

I have obviously levelled a lot of weapons to get to level 7 and have a fair amount of the Dojo weapons.

It's just I feel as if there is no real endgame, and being able to one hit every thing is too easy. I can solo most of the bosses in less than a minute with my forma'd Gorgon.

I am concerned that many others will be finding the same thing and get bored and leave. I really like Warframe, but I feel that adding a few weapons or frames every now and again will not stop the long term issue that the game is having with endgame stuff. I think Clans could be taken further, and so could pvp - clan wars?

Is anyone else feeling the same way? I don't want to give up on this great game yet!

1373732856.0,83,self.Warframe,1i81vi,The *real* problem with the new Aura system...,92,9,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1i81vi/the_real_problem_with_the_new_aura_system/,"I understand that some people are upset that we now have another mod that counts against our 60 (or 30) skill points available per Warframe. While I'm not crazy about it either, this really comes down to a balance issue, and we knew that things like costs, usefulness, and strength of mods could change throughout the beta.

So that isn't my complaint about the new system. Here *is* my complaint:

**The new aura system with polarities in place, forces each player to choose from a smaller subset of auras. There is now considerably less variability and *swappability* available to give the team different percs based on they type of mission or race being fought.**

For example, I have mostly been playing defense missions as Frost lately. As such, my primary responsibility to the team is to keep Snow Globe up and the cryopod defended. Given this need for energy, I *have to* have Energy Siphon equipped. So that means I'll need to forma my Frost so that he has the Energy Siphon polarity for his aura slot. But now, from a functional standpoint, that means that I can *only* run with auras that have the same polarity as Energy Siphon. I don't know the breakdown on the aura polarities, but this cuts down my viable options by 2/3 to 3/4. 

So after I've forma'd my aura slot, I'll be pretty well locked in to one of 4-or-5 auras [(edit: please see Korthe's comment for a better breakdown of aura polarities](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1i81vi/the_real_problem_with_the_new_aura_system/cb1wstl)). And this is going to be the case for everyone. People are already talking about Rifle Amp and Steel Charge and how these finally seem viable over Energy Siphon or Infested Impedance. That's great...we've wanted more functional options. ***But once that person formas to the polarity for Rifle Amp, they'll be pretty much locked into one of the ~4 auras with that polarity.***

Hopefully they get this straitened away. One of the great things about this game is having so many options available. Though the artifact system definitely needed work, it was nice being able to [""sideboard""](http://wiki.mtgsalvation.com/article/Sideboard) in a multitude of different abilities. The system as it stands now is actually a step backwards...it removes available choices and viable options.

1366666017.0,79,self.Warframe,1cw20h,[STEALTH BRAINSTORM] It needs work. A lot of work.,95,16,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1cw20h/stealth_brainstorm_it_needs_work_a_lot_of_work/,"Currently, stealth is far too unforgiving, and you usually have to rely on luck to keep the ship unalerted for the duration of a mission. This is coming from someone who has over 1000 hours dumped into the splinter cell franchise, so I'm no klutz.

It's lacking in a lot of areas, and some things need to be tweaked to make stealth both possible, viable, and rewarding. I mean come on, we're space ninjas. We should be stealthy.


MOTIVATION:

If we're talking pure numbers, playing stealthily gives you LESS affinity, as there are less enemies to kill, and you take longer with the mission. The solution would be to award the player more affinity for killing unaware targets, and even more affinity for stealth take-downs. Enough to compensate and even surpass a player who is going all out.  A stealth kill should award you 300% affinity, and a stealth-takedown should get you 400% affinity.

ALARMS:

The alarm system needs work.  All it takes is for a grineer or corpus to brush an alarm button with his arm hairs to send the entire ship on alert. Sure that's 'realistic' but we're playing a game here. It should take a full 5 seconds for an enemy to trigger an alarm, and perhaps a countdown timer should appear above his head, or a minimap warning.  Same should go for putting the ship into lockdown.

You should also be able to disable alarms or shoot alarms TO disable them, much like cameras. I see no reason why this can't be so.

ALERT:

If an enemy sees me, it should alert other enemies in a small radius of perhaps 5 meters... not an entire quarter of the ship.  For example, today I was crouch walking around with my paris, and I lined up a shot on a buzzsaw grineer. He went 'huh?' a half second before the arrow hit him in the face. A few seconds later, an entire platoon came rushing in ready to fight from a room waaaaay down the hall.

This is how I think it should go:   ""On Sight"" Alert:  Radius of 5 meters.  Gunfire Alert: Within audible radius.

Hell, the 'huh?' should make people come and investigate curiously, not cause them to go into FULL COMBAT MODE ENGAGE LETS KILL US SOME TENNO.

TAKEDOWNS:

Takedowns that dont kill an enemy should knock them down without giving out an alert, lining them up for a ground finishing move. Stealth takedowns should also do double charge damage... because it's stealth. Your space ninja, on an unalert enemy, should be able to line up to attack a vital organ no problem. That's the entire point of stealth, to attack on your own terms.

REACTION TIMES:

Need to be lowered, just slightly.  Not 'hur dumb' low, but enough to make it possible.

We're playing space ninjas, we aren't ACTUALLY space ninjas in real life.

LEVEL DESIGN:

Levels need to be designed with stealth in mind, especially doors.  The levels also would do good to be a little less linear. Not the linearity is a bad thing, but this game *wants* to be a bit more open. You can just feel it.  For stealthy-flippy ninjas, open levels are almost an obvious design choice.  People really seem to like the defense levels and the new ice levels.  We could use more levels that have hallways that still connect to the same room, rather then just one long hallway with a few random branches leading to storage lockers.  It would also help if the waypoint was simply a direction, and the hallways weren't dead ends. We'd have an idea as to where to go, and multiple choices on how to get there.  The 'hold my hand' waypoint system really limits how much fun you can have with this game.

SENTINELS:

The shade's Ghost feature is great, but if you're behind cover, a shade hovering in the wrong spot can ruin your stealth, and you can't directly control where they hover. When you crouch, they need to hover lower to the ground. Much lower.

1375389061.0,79,self.Warframe,1jioea,Lack of consistency in the mod system.,84,5,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1jioea/lack_of_consistency_in_the_mod_system/,"Mods are pretty much the biggest influence on game play and the system is just riddled with inconsistencies and trap itemization paths.

The prime example of this is, of course, critical strike. There are some weapons that have no crit chance innately and therefore gain zero benefit from crit chance or crit damage mods. This would be fine, if that information was accessible and clearly displayed to the player. The problem is, you have to consult the wiki or google docs weapon sheet to find these numbers. 

The same problem comes into play with mods like Continuity, Stretch and Focus (and others most likely) where the interaction varies from ability to ability without any clear indicator mentioned in the UI as to what the actual effect is. Continuity for example will actually give you additional projectiles on Nova's first ability. It also does not increase the duration of Vauban Tesla which instead has a fixed duration. Neither of these ""exceptions"" to the rule are explained to the player. 

What this creates is an environment in which players actively think they are coming up with cool builds to fit the style they want to play with. Maybe someone wants to have a Tesla army that last forever and turn the game into a tower defense game, if that player doesn't make the effort to research his build outside of the game, he might not even notice that the Tesla is, in fact, decaying after the base duration. 

Solution: When in the Arsenal swapping out mods, mousing over a mod card (focus, streamline, continuity, etc.) will highlight all abilities affected by this card in a **RED** outline. After the mod is equipped, mousing over the ABILITY card will now show the normal tool tip, as well as the MOD INTERACTION bonuses in **RED** at the bottom of the tool tip. 

EX: This is what a Tesla card would look like with FOCUS equipped.

Tesla 25 energy

Deals 80 / 100 / 120 / 150 Electrical damage per arc.

**FOCUS 30%: Deals 104/130/156/195 Electrical damage per arc.**

As for Critical strike, that fix is even simpler, just make it so that our weapons display a full rundown of every single stat on the mod page. 

EX:

Sobek:
Damage: Total damage done (Base damage/Element 1/Element2/Element3) i.e. 100 (60/20/20) breakdown would be colored to reflect what type of damage it is. 

Range: More numbers

Critical strike: number

Ammo capacity: banana

Reload time: Q

Puncture distance: LOL one uses this jk. ^^^sadface.

Multishot: numbers 

Obviously, I am lazy and do not have photoshop skills or I would put together a mockup. I think the concept is simple enough.

This is so stupid and is constantly reoccurring. Instead of just trying to fix every stuck-glich individually they need an unstuck button. Something that maybe teleports you back to the nearest basic floor you were in. Maybe have ""Safe points"" where once you cross there you can be teleported back. 

OR HELL JUST A BUTTON THAT BRINGS YOU BACK TO THE START OF THE LEVEL (or where you last assassinated target, etc etc for the run back). SOMETHING. This shouldn't be hard and would make the game much less frustrating for everyone while also making it seem more legitimate. If they go full-release on the ps4 without a unstuck-button they will VERY LIKELY get worse reviews if the reviewer manages to get stuck even once.

1372610222.0,75,self.Warframe,1hdcuw,[Suggestion] Warframe Ability Specialization,82,7,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1hdcuw/suggestion_warframe_ability_specialization/,"Suggestion: Have the choice to specialize a Warframe's abilities, once they are maxed rank, with a unique quality. So once you hit rank 3 you'd, for this example, have maybe 2 or 3 options to choose from to make a modification to a Warframe's ability that might suit your gameplay, or maybe to specialize towards the faction you wish to fight.

Examples:

**Slash Dash:**
 
*Specialization #1*: Choose change damage to an elemental type; i.e. AP, Fire, Ice, Electrical.

*Specialization #2*: Throws out an energy blade in a direction at the end of the Slash Dash (probably going the same direction you were, or maybe either side)

*Specialization #3*: You gain bonus melee damage for several seconds after you preform Slash Dash



**Sound Quake:**

*Specialization #1*: Gains Innate Armor Ignore or Armor Piercing (not sure which would be more preferred)

*Specialization #2*: Extend the radius of the stun effect, but the damage. (CC at a farther radius to help teammates farther away)

*Specialization #3*: Pick a dubstep track to play for the duration of the Sound Quake! (Ok, not serious, but I couldn't think of another, and this would still be awesome haha)



**Decoy:**

*Specialization #1*: Decoy explodes after duration expires

*Specialization #2*: Decoy gains the secondary the real Loki frame has, and fires live rounds for reduced damage (not sure how the damage would work, maybe half of whatever the damage the player's secondary can do?)

*Specializatoin #3*: Decoy will also make a fake of another random teammate. (Not sure about this one. Just throwing a 3rd one in there.)


So there are a couple examples. I don't want to make this post too large with examples. There's a lot that could be altered with this idea; maybe specialization only for ults, not every ability. Some of the examples aren't great, but just to get the idea across.

I just wanted to gauge the populous of the Warframe Subreddit on the idea. I think it might be nice because it would justify having multiples of the same frame ability as you could have 2 or 3 maxed mods for each ability, but each specialized differently for different factions, missions, etc.

Let me know what you guys think, or possibly add your own suggestions if you'd like.

Thanks for reading if you got this far!

Notice how poorly it scales. That's why you should farm the highest level mobs that you can kill fast.  
For information 50 exp is base for Moas, Crewmen and Techs (possibly more).

While I'm at it I'd also like to point out why I dislike Wiki. They actively discourage using datamined information. Here's a quote from wiki:
&gt; Any numbers/stats on Warframe Wikia are here purely by player input. Digital Extremes does not insert information on this wiki and thus none of it is official or finalized. Using ""data mined"" information is discouraged. The numbers/stats that have not been made officially public by Digital Extremes are numbers/stats that they plan to change on a regular basis. These numbers/stats can quickly become out of date. As with all information on any wiki or on the internet as a whole, be warned that it might be out of date within the hour, or just simply wrong as a result of vandalism. Thank you for your understanding.

Well it's true and personally i think it is unfair on people who legitimately grinded to try and hit top 100...Anyway, that's my opinion. Here is what they were doing and you decide weather it's fair. ( I share this now as the event is over and in a hope DE fixes it for future events )

First they go to Merrow, they run through the level and they then get to a tileset where you hear DERebecca say something like ""Careful, the grineer are approaching""
They then clear the next room, which more than often would have drones. 
Then they run back to the previous room and stand in the same place as when DERebacca warned you about the approaching grineer. around 10 seconds later she will say the same again, when they run into the room they just emptied, it is full again with enemies and drones.
Rinse and repeat..In doing this they were able to get a good amount of drones to spawn constantly.

This was all on the video that has since been taken down..Like i said, personally i think it is exploiting the game mechanics and people who have done it have been rewarded for it.

I really hope DE fix this for future events otherwise it's is going to be constantly unfair.

Anyway, any thoughts? Do people think it's ok for them to do this, or not?

I suggest this because in a boss battle after it dies, someone can ground pound with their melee item or shoot the blueprint on accident, and it can become unobtainable because it can go through walls. This will draw it to 1 central location where this can still happen, but it is less likely, because it will be easier to see(making it easier to avoid shooting it).

Upgrading this mod will increase how far it will attract items. It should not use up much space, as it will become widely used over time(for farming). I drew this diagram (excuse my expert paint skills) for example: [Clicky Clicky.](http://i.imgur.com/dLP7PwI.jpg)

Red is without an upgrade and it goes up by upgrade: orange being 2, yellow 3, green 4, and etc. I feel the devs should govern how many times the range should be able to increase.

By attract I don't mean *^slowly* gravitate towards you I mean it will make the pickup **rush** towards your feet quickly, making all the pick-ups for other players in that location.

*""Wait, Tenno, something isn't right here. It's a trap -- I can't extract you.""*

Well, shoot. Your ride's scooting out so it doesn't get shot down, and there's a short wait, while the game checks your team size.

**If it's three or under**

Then your objective is simple. The objective isn't here, it's just a trap. Your team has to move to a special trap room (it holds the controls for the guns about to blow your incoming ride out of the sky) , then proceed to hold it against a few waves of enemies, then beeline it (timer) to the extraction room. Rather than a destructible object, there's area or two that, if enemies are in it, a progress bar fills. It empties slowly if there are none. If it fills, fission mailed.

But...

**If you have a team of four**

The mission is different. The objective *is* here, and it's been used as bait. You need to secure both it, and your way out. Rather than your original objective disappearing, you now have two different objective markers. And you need to split up and do them at the same time. Everybody on defense, the objective escapes. Everybody on objective, the ride gets shot down. The faster the objective team progresses, the harder a fight the defenders have on their hands, as the waves spawn faster.

The small balls that attach to you and explode.

I'm talking about the fast moving, hard to shoot assholes that jump at you and cause you to stagger. Over and over and over again, until you deal with them.

Slide dash only works if they're like right in front of you on a flat surface. Many times you'll slide dash at them up a stairway or a hill and they'll completely ignore damage.

They will sometimes completely ignore radial javelins. Sometimes being about half the time.  Or it could be all the time, I haven't used it that often against them, but it does feel like -every- time.

I only have Excal so I've only used those abilities against them.


Here are some changes that I think would make them less frustrating, because seriously they're worse than *cliff racers*.  Any of these changes by themselves would make them less frustrating, but all are recommended.

* Make their health very small so that they're much easier to deal with.

* Make them controlled by Seekers. If you kill the Seeker, the rollerball is deactivated. Limit the seekers to Latchers OR Rollerballs, and limit Rollerball supply to 1.   ((Other changes are not necessary if this is used))

* Slow them way down. They should only speed up when they're lined up for an attack. Or have them spin out when they miss an attack, giving you a chance to fire at them.

* Don't make them part of the initial patrolling enemies. This ruins any possibility of stealth gameplay right off the bat. (This should happen regardless of other balance changes)

&gt; Maybe if they ""burn out"" on their own? Say, every time they do that obnoxious ""jump attack"", they use 1/3 of their energy? When they reach 0, they self destruct?
This way, worst thing that can happen is you get stunned 3 times before being able to move on.
^/u/DesignNomad

&gt;How about we get rid of the Latchers and the Rollerballs and combine them into one thing.  A large ball that jumps at you, exploding, which knocks you down.  It should do damage, and the knockback can get you into trouble and push you out of cover. ^/u/Subhazard

-

&gt; if you were able to slow them down with a freeze mod, woulnd't that make them less annyoing, or actually not annyoing at all? Seeing as how slow mobs move with just 1 shot, I think that would make people a lot more happier than just getting rid of them in general. ^/u/K3ro6430

""Backward,"" you ask, ""what do you mean?"" I mean, the reward this time is a less tangible object. The reward is game-wide access to new maps, but it doesn't feel like an event with a reward; what it feels like is punishment with a possibility of overcoming. IMO, DE should have released the tile sets, new areas, and all the new content along with a temporary event themed on said new content. This would feel much more like a celebration rather than this grindfest we have now.

This probably comes off as a little unappreciative, I know, but I'm honestly just thinking DE would've had a much more successful event if they had done it this way instead, don't you?

1375831582.0,65,self.Warframe,1juh38,New tile set idea - hull exterior,72,7,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1juh38/new_tile_set_idea_hull_exterior/,"I was playing with a few clan-mates just now and this idea came to me for a new tile set, upon discussion they all seemed to like it so I thought I'd put it forward to you guys too.

We invade these ships all the time and I think there's even more potential DE can get out of them. We know the Warframes themselves are capable of supporting the Tenno in space because of the extraction process. I think it would be cool to see missions set on the hulls of the ships themselves, taking out say a communications antenna or something more vital to the ship, maybe even rescuing a Tenno whose own extraction ended up going badly and who is now stranded, surrounded black-hawk down style on the hull.

This, though a lot of work, would present a lot of potential in both art and level design for DE, here's a few ideas I had:

* New environmental hazard: asteroid belt/meteor shower, perhaps small amounts of randomized shield drain, could even make the rocks actual projectiles coming intermittently from a single direction so the Tenno and their enemies could take cover from them effectively.

* Presuming artificial gravity or even magnetized Warframe feet there's some pretty cool level design potential, of course there couldn't be open access across the entire hull because that kind of goes against the semi-linear nature of the game's level design but who's to say one tile on this massive ship couldn't take you say from the side of the ship to the underbelly with gravity changing accordingly? Would be cool to even be able to briefly make the leap of faith into the great beyond before being teleported back to the ship.

* There is so much potential for awesome visuals, imagine looking up to see a nebula, huge planets, passing meteors and comets, maybe even a Grineer armada engaging the corpus fleet. Those huge cannons from the galleon tile set firing away around you as you battle through external defense turrets and any of the mobs that could presumably survive in space.

* New enemy potential is also a big area, with the freedom of a lot of... well... space above there's potential for a lot of flying mobs, Grineer with jet packs for example, bigger bosses like huge ship-defence drones or even mech-like Grineer units meant to repel any boarding attempts.

* Mission types could be spiced up and even added to, that black-hawk scenario I mentioned could replace the traditional rescue for this tile set, sabotaging shield emitters through external access points hidden behind panels, taking out weapons from the outside, even blowing a huge hull breach in the ships hull where the barracks is located and watching all the unprepared Grineer or Corpus get sucked out into the void of space.

The potential for a tile set like this is huge and I feel it fits with the Tenno's role of subterfuge and stealth, who expects 4 Tenno to attack a ship on their own from the outside?

* Shield Drain
* Laser
* Sonic

The basic damage is called Bullet. This is what most guns have.  
Explosion is stuff like Ogris explosion, grenades, Thunderbolt.  
Four of these are on almost every mob's armor-ignore list: Armor Piercing, Serrated Blade, Physics Impact and Poison.  
The others are self-explanatory (somewhat).  

Every mob has its own list of protected body parts. If you hit a protected body part, the damage (no matter what type) will go through armor formula provided it's not on ignore list. After that (doesn't matter if damage type is on ignore list), every mob has its own table for damage type modifiers for specific body parts. Examples:

* 0 bullet for head part (corpus crewmen)
* 0.5 electricity for any part (ancients)
* 2 fire for any part (most if not all infested)
* 1.5 bullet for head part (ancients)
* 3.0 serrated blade for any part (most light infested)

At this point, the damage gets multiplied by a multiplier depending on where it hit and what type of damage it is (examples above). 
Then each mob has its own weak spots (e.g. head) which multiplies the damage again (e.g. 2 for head).

Examples for disrupting ancients (300 base armor):

* 100 fire damage hitting a level 5 disrupting ancient's torso would be reduced to 25 (100 * 100 / (100 + 300)) then multiplied by 2 due to the multiplier for a total of 50.
* 100 fire damage hitting a level 5 disrupting ancient's head would be reduced to 25 (same as above) then multiplied by 2 due to the multiplier and then again multiplied by 2 due to hitting the head for a total of 100.
* 100 bullet damage hitting a level 5 disrupting ancient's head would be reduced to 25 (same as above) then multiplied by 1.5 due to the multiplier and then again multiplied by 2 due to hitting the head for a total of 75 damage.
* 100 poison damage hitting a level 5 disruption ancient's torso would not be reduced because it's on ignore list then multiplied by 1.0 due to the multiplier for a total of 100 damage.

Here's in game testing that proves this (its scaling is wrong tho): [Ancient Disruptor Wiki](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Ancient_Disruptor)

Example calculation for level 31 Grineer Lancer getting hit by Dread with level 8 Serration and level 5 Hellfire (352.5 normal):  

Lancer damage multipliers: 

* Fire: 1.25
* Electricity: 1.25
* Armor Piercing: 1.5
* Bullet (only head): 1.5

Big numbers incoming for accuracy:

* Calculate armor: 30^1.4 * 0.01 * 200 + 200 = 433.88359045497134889406398538164
* Calculate damage reduction: 100/(100+armor) = 0.1873067496133020223968174056274
* Round damage:  
normal -&gt; 352  
fire -&gt; 352 * 0.9 rounded to the nearest integer = 317
* Apply armor and multipliers:  
352 * 0.1873067496133020223968174056274 = 65.931... * 1.0 = 65  
317 * 0.1873067496133020223968174056274 = 59.376... * 1.25 = 74.22... = 74  

And we have ourselves the real numbers. It always rounds down for damage. Damage can't be &lt; 1 if multiplier is &gt; 0.",,False,self,t5_2urg0,1372841289.0,,,True,t3_1gwrac,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1gwrac/armor_and_elemental_damage/,

To that end (and a couple others coincidentally), I would like to see some ~~Cards~~ Artifacts added that can be selected prior to missions and shared across the other Tenno in your mission. These names are off the cuff and meant to be taken lightly.

Such as :

* Farmer Bob - +chance when materials pop for them to be rare(r).

* Farmer Rick - +quantity of any material drops.

* Farmer Tom - +chance of materials popping.

(Another set could account for the 'research' materials that can drop as well.)

* Rifle Engineer - +chance for rifle mods

* Sidearm Engineer - +chance for sidearm mods

* Shotgun Engineer - +chance for shotgun mods

* Sniper Engineer - +chance for sniper mods

* Martial Engineer - +chance for melee mods

* Crafting Expert - +rarity of mods

The following would all likely be VERY small modifications, but could create a telling difference in some situations.

* Workhorse - +stamina % for all Tenno

* Spirit of the Wolf - +runspeed for all Tenno (shoutout to Everquest!)

* Electric Personality - +electric damage for all Tenno

* Spicy Meatball - +fire damage for all Tenno

* The Cooler - +ice damage for all Tenno

* Piercing Gaze - +piercing damage for all Tenno

* Known Assassin - +level of mobs in instance -or- more elite mobs

* Six of One ... - Two mods as rewards, pick one lose other.

Ok, that's all I've got for now. This really isn't for brainstorming or anything, just some ideas I had that would make the game a lot deeper and give the players at least a semblance of control over their instance runs. Maybe DE will see this and hopefully they've already got something similar to this in the works because the crafting is tedious and farming materials is also QUITE tedious with no real control over drop rates, as we've seen.

I play a Frost with Rush (+25% speed) and Marathon (+100% stamina) mods, so I'm not super slow, but was made to feel like it in this group.

Two of the players, an Ash (no surprise there) and a Rhino rushed the level, leaving me and the other player trying to catch up while fighting all of the grineer they hadn't bothered to kill. This resulted in me not actually ever seeing Ruk, so I couldn't get any of the drops as I didn't know where he had died, and was too far away to actually get any experience from the kill. What made it worse was that I'm currently farming Ember BPs, and had had a run of nothing dropping, so it feels like that run may have yielded a BP.

Whether that would have been the case or not, these two players rushed all the way to extraction, which started the timer as I was getting to the room where Ruk had been. I managed to make it with around 15 seconds to spare, fighting off the grineer as best as I could. The last player only managed to get to extraction with about half a second left, and probably had to fight through the stronger grineer which I couldn't kill as I was sprinting for extraction.

Please be considerate of other players guys.

Talk to us about this DE.,91,29,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1f4lx4/scorpions_theyre_simply_unfair_talk_to_us_about/,"Warning: The following text is going to come off as a bit angry, as I find it hard to even think about the Scorpion without nearly bursting into flames.

Okay, were Scorpions made to make Rollerballs seem less of a pain in the ass? Is that why their tag line is 'makes the hurt feel good'?  Is this just a massive troll?

Because they're seriously bullshit.

They have little to no windup, they attack and target almost instantly, at pretty long range, THROUGH geometry and objects, and take control away from the player for several seconds.

This is lazy, this is infuriating. This is especially infuriating after you guys said you were going to do less stuns.  Your customers have been -screaming- about coming up with more inventive ways of challenging the player other than ripping the controls out of their hands. We've given you pages upon pages of suggestions.

I was going to make this part of a much larger post, which talked about the good, bad and ugly of Update 8 (which is mostly good!  No, not good, incredible) but this bullshit really needs it's own spotlight.

DE_Steve, you hang out around here a lot, can you explain why you guys decided to create such an INFURIATING enemy?  I can't tell you how many times I've been stunlocked into death because of these assholes.

While I'm at it. Stunlocks, and undodgeable attacks *need to fucking go*.  This is a game that gives a beautiful range of movement and adaptability to the player, and instead of CHALLENGING the skills that make this game so fun, it makes them completely void with undodgeable attacks.

Phorid's scream and missile attack are undodgeable. The scream can nearly kill an unmodded loki in one go, and the missile attack pretty much one shots most frames.

Okay, back to scorpions. One shouldn't give criticism if they don't have a suggestion to make it better.


There's a number of things I think that could be done.

To those reading, these are multiple, separate suggestions, don't read them as 'all or nothing'

Longer windup:  They pretty much attack instantly upon sight+range now.  Give the player a chance to actually respond to the threat.  The Shockwave Moa's have a windup, why can't the scorpions? Why do the grineer need so many stuns?

Escape: Taking control away from the player is bullshit. It's lazy design. You know it. Everyone knows that. If you don't think so, it's because you're making excuses to rush something out the door during crunch time. 

Give the player the ability to shoot with his primary while on his back OR give the player the ability to quickly tap a button to wrestle free from the lasso  OR give the player a timed prompt to break free, earlier than usual, which requires finesse, and less mash.

Projectile Based Grapple:  Make it so the scorpion must aim and fire the grapple, rather than instantly targetting and hitting the player, giving the player the ability to dodge (like the ancient arm attack. THAT'S fun.). If the scorpion hits and obstacle, she must reel in her grapple and try again.

To that end, to celebrate the decanting of my newest Warframe, the Ash, I've went on a nostalgia spree. I've purchased a brand new MK1-BRATON (15kcr) and LATO (10kcr). I was going to pair these with a SKANA (15kcr + 15kcr), but seeing as even that has to be crafted now, I decided to instead go for a CRONUS (drop + 15kcr). I have also unequipped my Sentinel. All gear started at level zero, using only mods that dropped and would fit (read: none - warframe powers only).

**THE TEST:** Consisted of completing the following missions, in order: Terminus, M Prime, Caloris, Elion, Lares, Tolstoj. Missions were completed solo, making sure to explore to slightly more than a reasonable degree, ""stumbling"" upon several semi-secret rooms.

**THE RESULTS:** Completed with one death (courtesy of Vor's teleport sneak attack). End levels: Ash 7.05, MK1-BRATON 4.0, LATO 3.25, CRONUS 3.95 (sliver away from 4). Gained seven mods, including one Rare (Sundering Strike, dropped from Vor) and Redirection (dropped off an Infested). Gained Cronus blueprint. Gained 8,862 credits.

**CONCLUSIONS:**

**A:** Not able to purchase *anything*, not even craft the CRONUS (15kcr). Not able to upgrade to BRATON (25kcr), not able to upgrade to AKLATO (25kcr), not able to sidegrade to SICARUS (20kcr), not able to sidegrade to STRUN (75kcr). Don't even get me strated on craft requirements for some weapons. I've already faced and defeated a boss (unlikely, for a player just starting out) and I can't even switch up from the starting guns. This is *greatly* demoralizing.

**B:** Grineer Planetoid tileset is introduced alongside either a boss, or a whole new enemy group, giving no opportunity to familiarize. Consider changing Caloris to Planetoid tileset.

**C:** CRONUS, and by extension SKANA, are very bad weapons to start with, specifically because you fight Grineer, which leads players to believe non-charged melee is utterly useless. Please consider A: Doubling slashing damage vs. light-armored humanoids (some Grineer, Corpus crewmen) the same way it's tripled vs. unarmored Infected and B: Introducing new low-level (&lt;5) Grineer mobs (placeholder name: Grineer Conscript), who are equivalent to Lancers but wear Light armor. Decrease amount in favor of Lancers as level increases.

**D:** The player is not sufficiently introduced to the Polarity system. Suggestion: Give the MK1-BRATON a single V polarity slot.

1373468557.0,56,self.Warframe,1i0e61,[UNOFFICIAL] The Aftermath of the Informer Genocide - Community Event Discussion Thread,63,7,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1i0e61/unofficial_the_aftermath_of_the_informer_genocide/,"Hey guys! I hope that you are all doing well and having much fun sniping baddies with your shiny new toys. I'd like to extend a special congratulations to those that managed to nab a spot in the Top 100, as well as those clans that managed to obtain a shiny Informer statue for their Dojos!

With the felicitations finished, I think that now is a good time to take a serious and analytic look at the Informer Community Event. While there are a few things that were enjoyable and fun about the event, I believe that there were a lot of problems that need to be acknowledged and assessed; hopefully, we can avoid some of the frustrations of this events in the next one and expand on what people actually enjoyed.

&gt; Let's start with the **PROS**.

___

* The Snipetron Vandal is a very good weapon; it is the best sniper out right now. Additionally, it came with its own potato and slot!
* They added Snipetron blueprints in for everyone (who got the twenty kills). 
* Getting twenty Informer kills was not hard.
* Offering a Dojo Statue really encouraged inter-clan competition. Additionally, the different challenge tiers for various clans sizes demonstrated DE's willingness to work towards creating a game friendly to clans of all sizes.

&gt; And now, the **CONS**.

___


* The nature of the Informers, as well as the set-up of the event itself, encouraged players to play solo rather than in groups. This sort of detracted from the entire experience - after all, Warframe is primarily a co-op PvE game! I don't think than anyone really *liked* hunting what were essentially glorified balloons. They did nothing but alert you to their own presence.
* Poor communication between DE and players on various levels. For example, no global kill goal was given. As a result, no one had any sort of idea how many were we supposed to kill in order to actually ensure that we got the Snipetron Vandal! 
* Killing the informers just wasn't very fun.
* The personal kill goal was very low (twenty measly kills), encouraging players to just kill the number that they needed and then stop. It really wasn't a challenge at all. While there were some incentives to keep farming Informers, I feel as though killing at least fifty would've been a better minimum.
* DE should have notified players that they were taking the Snipetron off the market in the first place - while it was cool that DE gave us a last chance to have at it, it would have probably been coolest if they gave us a heads up.
* What was the point of giving out the Snipetron AND the Snipetron Vandal? I know that this isn't a strict con, but... I don't know, it just seems a bit silly considering that the Vandal is entirely superior to the Vanillatron.
* There has been talk of people using exploits to get into the Top 100, obtaining an exclusive mod (Primed Chamber) that gives them a large advantage over others. While I know this is a PvE game, I'm sure that people will agree with me when I say that this isn't exactly fair (although, I know that many will also argue with me on this point).

&gt; **SUGGESTIONS.**

___

* Incentivize killing the special mobs by increasing their chance to drop mods, giving them a chance to drop a unique mod, boosting the XP gain - anything! Just don't make them balloons again!
* Make the special mobs fun to play with/kill. When the Fusion Moas came out, they actually came out to fight you - and they also launched drones! While they shouldn't be touting as some sort of game-changing, super-fun mob, they were inarguably more fun than the Informers.
* Create different personal reward tiers (25 drones, 50 drones, 100 drones, etc.).
* Communicate better with us, DE! We know you're capable of it! At least let us know how many of the damn things we need to kill!

1375751917.0,57,self.Warframe,1js4bf,My 15 problems with Warframe,88,31,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1js4bf/my_15_problems_with_warframe/,"My 15 Problems with Warframe


1.  Molecular Prime:  Need to remove the 60 second debuff.  Nova is fantastic at taking out groups of trash-mobs and should remain that way.  The 60 seconds of double damage to highlevel mobs and bosses is icing on an already splendid cake.

2.  Fix the blue generator room:  The one in the Grineer Galeon that has every single new player running in circles for 10 minutes.  The stairs aren't very apparent to new players and they shouldn't have to be.  This room doesn't make sense.

3.  Orthos Prime:  Requires more resources then an Orthos but has the exact same stats.  It's the only prime weapon that functions this way.  

4.  Research Requirements:  Please add another object to the clan building process.  A system where we need to use 2 Fieldron, 3 Other buildable object, 10 gallium, 6000 ferrite or something like that.  Make the requirements for the Other buildable object something other than control circuits and plastids.  The focus on plastids and control circuits is waaaaay to high.  Adding another object and lowering the fieldron costs would make that better.

5.  Add Credit Sink:  I know the average Warframe player doesn't have this problem, but there are quite a few of us sitting pretty on millions of credits.  Anything to relieve that would be awesome.  Exclusive weapon skins that cost huge amounts of credits is one idea.  They don't even have to be creative.  Putting a flame decal on my Braton would be an amusing use for a million credits.

6. Don't Patch on Friday:  I loved hearing that update 9 was hours away a couple weeks ago.  If technical problems arise that delay it till the ass of night, DON'T PUT IT OUT.  If you are going to be in the office for the next 2 days, don't leave the community with hugely messed up drop tables.  Those 2 days of seemingly limitless morphics and control modules were game breaking.  If you can't patch early Friday, patch Thursday or Monday.  Give yourself enough time to make the game stable after large updates.

7.  Enemy Armor Scaling:  This has been explained to death so I'm not going to go into detail on this point.  

8.  Prime Frames:  Also a point that has been talked to death.  Please make a level 30 version of the frame a requirement in the prime blueprint.  Frost Prime removes the need to own a Frost.  

9.  Increased Upper Limits on Mods:  I love how Serration and Hornet Strike work.  There needs to be something to do after you have unlocked all of the weapons and mods.  For me, this has been throwing mods at leveling Serration.  Increasing the cap on some of the mods would allow us to greater customize our weapons and that growth is already kept in check by the experientially increasing level requirements. 

10. More Transparency in Statistics:  At this point, most of us are huge fans of Pwnatron's stat sheets.  This shouldn't be necessary.  Give us this information in game when selecting weapons.  What kind of damage a gun does and how that damage type effects different enemies is vital information.  

11.  Remove Mod Button:  This feature is more important than a consignment store. It's more important than new maps.  It's more important than more weapons.  Having bundles of weapons makes this problem worse.

12. Event Contingencies:  Stop trusting your math.  There should always be a fall back scenario in events with limited resources.  The Formorian ships dying 13 hours before the scheduled end of the event was devastating to some players.  It arbitrarily punished people who were reasonably unaware of the exact event conditions.  This could have easily been addressed by having an additional Formorian ship appear in the event the players destroyed the initial ships.  If you want to keep the player base happy,  any event that functions as a competition should have very clear rules and a definite start and stop time.

13.  Paris Prime Sound: Small point but it seems to be universally agreed upon.  The Paris Prime sounds awful.

14.  Fix Mod List.   There is no reason to show us duplicate mods in the configuration screen.  We can't place duplicate mods on our weapons and frames.  Please stop having me go through 3 pages of Ammo Drum for no reason.  If we have more than 1 of a mod, only show us the mods with differing levels.

15.  High Mastery Weapons:  With the addition of a few weapons we will be able to access Mastery 12.  I loved seeing the requirements on the Lanka and Acrid when update 8 rolled out.  Please give us a weapon or weapon skin for every possible mastery level.  Even if it's a small flame decal on the stock Lato.  High mastery level players have put huge amounts of time into the game, it would be cool to have something to show for it.

16. Add Charge Bar:  The Ogris and Lanka need a more visible charge bar, preferably in the HUD.  Adding a blue light in front of the Lanka does nothing when the light cant be seen while aiming.  Not having a charge indicator can be annoying with bows but can be weapon breaking with weapons that fail to fire without being charged.  Without sound, these weapons become very temperamental. 

All that said,  I love Warframe.  I've been a GrandMaster for a month or two now and I wish nothing but the best for DE and Warframe.  The accessibility and candidness of the Dev team is what convinced me to put money into this fantastic game and I haven't regretted it for a second.

The map is 2000m according to the maximum waypoint distance before you reset and fall again. I was getting 2-3 resets per second. That works out to ~5 km/s.

1373590781.0,55,self.Warframe,1i4ejp,"[CONCEPT] Mandala, the Tenno Mystic",65,10,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1i4ejp/concept_mandala_the_tenno_mystic/,"As we all know, most of the Tenno, powers aside, are very similar. Warriors to the core, wielding blade and gun against all who threaten them... But what if there was one Tenno, reliant upon her powers, who was a more... meditative sort? That's what I suggest here with ""Mandala"", a Warframe based on Shinto priests.

Now, I'm not the best at working out how her powers would work, but, because of the inherent fact that her powers punish the aggression of enemies, I would imagine that she has a high starting shield value, even if her health and armor are more lacking. Maybe...

Shields: 150
Armor: 50
Health: 100

Her powers would be the following.

Slot 1: **Disable**

*Mandala punishes a single enemy for their aggression, violently destroying their weapon in their hands. For those without a weapon, they're faced with their own aggression turned inward, injuring them, and stunning them temporarily.*

Energy Cost: 25

Damage: 30/40/50, Armor Ignored

This power, when it first strikes an enemy, does nothing. It doesn't even trigger alertness. Instead, that enemy's weapon starts to glow. When they're alerted, and attempt to fire, however, the weapon explodes in their hands, dealing damage, and Disarming them. If used on a disarmed enemy (whether because of her or Loki), they instead are stunned when they attack, taking half the normal damage.


Slot 2: **Guardian Seal**

*Creates a floating defensive seal that catches enemy fire in front of Mandala, and once released, propels those projectiles forward in a storm of death.*

Energy Cost: 10 per second, maximum of 5 seconds before automatic release.

Damage: 25 damage, +combined damage of captured projectiles

What this is is basically a small barrier that Mandala stops in one place, and maintains in front of her, catching enemy projectiles until she releases the button, or it automatically releases, propelling the combined firepower forward. Less effective against slow firing enemies, DEVASTATING against enemies with a high rate of fire. It's similar to Nyx's Ultimate, but one a smaller, more focused scale. The width of the resulting wall of bullets would be similar to Frost's Ice Wave, for example. It's a line, rather than a cone.

Slot 3: **Open Palm**

*Mandala dashes forward, slamming a palm into an enemy, releasing a burst of energy, and sending them and those around them floating harmlessly into the air where they can be picked off at leisure.*

Energy Cost: 75

Damage: None, ragdolls enemies and floats them in midair for 3/5/8 seconds.

Not much to say here. Mandala dashes forward, and strikes forward either at the end of her dash, or if she hits an enemy, sending them and their buddies floating into the air. The range isn't very impressive, maybe 10/15/20 meters in game. It doesn't actually HURT the enemy, just disables them for a few seconds.

Slot 4: **Nirvana**

*Mandala reaches out, and punishes any enemy that attacks her or their allies.*

Energy Cost: 100

Damage: Not listed. Similar to Miasma.

Duration: 6/8/10 seconds

This is Mandala's Ultimate. The screen changes perspective to view Mandala and her surroundings from above, while a... well, [mandala](http://jqgaines.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/img_77431.jpg) (yes, it being a lotus is intentional) forms in the color of her energy, covering a large area. Any enemy that attacks in this area has her teleport next to them, and strike them with an open palm, vaporizing them instantly. On Bosses, it just does a LOT of damage. Not sure how much.

But yeah, basically this is the rundown. She's a Warframe that actually is at her BEST once the enemy knows she's around.

1371442110.0,56,self.Warframe,1ghtku,About puncture....,60,4,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1ghtku/about_puncture/,"So, as well all know, puncture is pretty much pointless at the moment. 15 points for .35 meters of puncture? That's just barely enough to go through a shield, let alone multiple enemies. The issue could always be solved by increasing the range, but even then enemies still have to be close for that to be effective at all.

With that, I propose my new idea.

*(As a minor side note, lowering the cost of the current mods would be more than enough. 6 or 7 seems a bit more worth it than 15.)*

My idea would be to do something along the lines of what Killing Floor does. Instead of just having it travel a certain distance, make the bullets/pellets go all the way through the enemies. **However, add a percent amount of damage that actually goes through.** So a level 0 mod with puncture could have 20% puncture, meaning your bullets/pellets will travel through indefinitely; however, only 20% of the total damage will follow, and so forth for the next enemy. Rifles could have a max of 80% or so while shotguns could get 100% (let's be honest, you're not gonna snipe anyone with a shotgun anymore). That would definitely make the 15 it costs worth it.

If anything, puncture definitely needs to be brought up. It's by far the most worthless rare mod in the game. It needs a change.

**Edit:** As a side note, also give weapons with puncture mods the ability to shoot through thin cover like rails and anything else you could normally easily shoot through with the current puncture mods. That way shooting through cover doesn't need to be sacrificed.",,False,self,t5_2urg0,1371472624.0,,excalibur-pendragon,True,t3_1ghtku,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1ghtku/about_puncture/,

I want to focus on Defense missions here.  I recently trawled through a ton of feedback on the forums [here](https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/32244-defense-maps-module-loss-upon-failing-a-simple-solutioncompromise/), where one of the eventual conclusions that I think is valid is that there is no reason to continue past wave 5 or 10.  Defense missions are not quick, and a loss on wave 13 is costing (ballpark guess) 20-30 minutes or 15ish mods + experience, with the only potential benefit being another 95% chance for a Hellfire mod.  However, the only thing people are asking for is guaranteed rewards; reverting the recent changes for defense maps, or implementing checkpoint systems for loot dropped, etc.  This bothers me because I think defense missions have a lot of potential, and loot security just dumps the mode with the rest as a mindless sprint + destroy.

After much rambling, this was something I mentioned in a somewhat related thread on the forums:

&gt;The game needs harder content for replay value and better tiered loot to reward higher difficulty. The new defense risk/reward system would be perfect if there was a tangible reward (eg, planet enemy 30+, wave 20+ includes alert loot table). As far as more time consuming development, more intricate boss mechanics would be my dream addition. Just take the Fel Reaver from outside Black Temple, give him a Corpus Skin and toss him in Pluto with a Scindo+ drop that has +5% damage and some flashy lights. 

[](/raritywhy)I **WANT** harder content DE.  I **WANT** to have consequences for risk (honestly, the whole jumping off the map sans penalty is silly).  But I'm not a complete masochist; give me a carrot on a stick and I will have a ton of fun working through the challenges to get to the end.  Sure, if I want to fight enemies that don't all die to two Hek shots I could play a defense for 50 waves, but when the only reward is 2 minutes of satisfaction and some karma on reddit I'd rather just make endless shitty memes until one manages to take off.

 Make the common:uncommon:rare ratio actually depend on wave number.  Or just make it depend on enemy level, since the enemy level depends both on location and wave #.  Just thought of this suggestion and now it seems more important than the rest of this post.

With the Paris and Dread bows, when using the Speed Trigger mod, you can see the effect of faster charging in the animation of the arm moving. Whilst the sound doesn't change.

The same goes with the charged weapons in the Dojo labs but without an animation. Which leaves you guessing when your weapon is ready to release the attack.

1. People have already touched on this but there doesn't need to be an energy cost for connecting hallways. This saves clans from having to put a reactor right off their initial hall. I know this can be demolished and moved later, once the functionality for that is in, but until then this is a pain. Let people at least get some wings constructed so they can have a reactor wing going fairly early on.

2. When constructing pieces in the build menu, show whether a connector will have a dead end. This will save a lot of time and frustration for architects. Mostly a quality of life thing, but a lot of time and effort has been wasted on dead ends thus far. 

3. The hallways you can build, while beautiful, need to have some function or community appeal. One thought I had was to turn a clan hall into a ""Duelists Hall"" or something along those lines, where there could be a duelists leaderboard within the clan or something to give a little sense of competition among clan members who PvP a lot. Other ideas: ""Builder's Hall"" (shows top donors to Dojo construction) and ""Raider's Hall"" (think global leaderboard as exists except clan specific).

4. Allow architects to plan ahead. If someone wants to make a research wing, they should be able to queue up all the pieces they want to complete that wing ahead of time, and clan members can contribute resources as items are completed or become available. 

5. Allow people to jump into missions with clan members from the Dojo. The Dojo right now feels like a place to go hang out and waste time, rather than actually playing the game. Clan members should be able to hop into missions together from the Dojo. One potential idea would be to have a ""Map Room"" which you can build somewhere in the Dojo. This room would have an interactive console that would bring up the standard menu map that we get at login, and allow for clan members to queue up together. Right now someone wants to do the alert mission and they have to leave the Dojo to invite people, which is rather clunky and unnecessary. This change would make the Dojo feel more like a mission control, or base for your clan, rather than a fancy vacation house.

 * **Cons**

* **Somewhat random flight path/physics.** It doesn't always fly in a line towards the crosshair, making it very difficult to reliably predict where it's going to go and what it's going to hit at close to mid range. Also, it has a tendency to discover the tiniest change in a surface's angle and then rebound off that angle, typically towards the ceiling. 

* **Not great for team play.** The Glaive follows the rule that projectiles are blocked by teammates' bodies. This means that it will ricochet off your teammates and *also off dead bodies that are still standing.* (E.G. people killed with frost damage.) These factors, combined with its dependency on FPS/ping (covered below) make it extremely difficult to use reliably with teammates.

* **Dependent on FPS/Ping.** The Glaive, like ~~most~~ all other projectile weapons, is difficult to use offhost due to latency and travel time. Also, it is severely affected by FPS. (I tend to get around 10-15 FPS in groups, and about 20-30 solo. I'm on a laptop, what can I say?) In a group and off-host, I could barely throw it in a straight line, much less hit anything with it. Solo, however, I was slicing and dicing all over. 


 * **Pros** 

* **High Throw Damage.** The base charge damage is 150, and reportedly 450 against infested. I know  that with a 125% charge damage mod and 20% electrical damage mod on my Glaive, I did 1105 damage against an unknown infested with a throw. (I didn't see which infested I hit, but I saw the number pop up.) EDIT: The throw does 3x damage to light infested, but normal damage to Ancients. 

* **TWO POLARITY SLOTS.** That's right folks, that Skana Prime is no longer the only melee weapon with two polarity slots! The Glaive has a V Slot and a Bar Slot, which makes it *perfectly* optimized for Charge Speed/Charge Damage, since Killing Blow (charge damage) is V-polarity, and Reflex Coil (charge speed) is Bar-polarity.

* **Looks and sounds badass.** This is the ultimate style-points weapon, and let me tell you, hitting an enemy at long range with a bank shot is *extremely* satisfying. Plus, the charge sound and in-flight sound are awesome. 

 * **Tips and Tricks** I will try to update this section a few times as I find new features.
* If you miss at first, don't give up! The Glaive will hit anything between it and you on its return path, so if you miss at first, maneuver so that the intended target is *between* you and the Glaive, which means it will hit them on the return path.

**Conclusion**

The Glaive is a very fun, high-damage weapon that is absolutely *infuriating* to use until you get the hang of it. It requires a lot of practice and patience to master (I haven't gotten there yet, but I can already tell that's the case.) 

* Final Note - There's a lot of bitching going on about ""Rah rah rah DE didn't give us a glaive alert instantly rah rah rah pay to win rah rah etc. etc."" and honestly, it's not justified. DE needs money just like everyone else, and by waiting to release an alert (probably in 24-48 hours, but don't quote me!), they ensure that people who buy the Glaive with Platinum have a day or so to enjoy it, get used to it, etc. before *everyone* has one, therefore making buying a Glaive a little more special, and more advantageous. Those of you who can't afford the Glaive, just have patience, you will have one soon enough! Please don't rage at DE for trying to make money, Steve needs to be be able to put gas in his car and afford a closet *full* of pink shorts!

**TL;DR** Glaive is awesome but takes a lot of practice. Also, don't be that guy that bitches about pay-to-win when the weapon hasn't even been out for a day. Nobody likes that guy. Fuck that guy.

EDIT: Apparently, off-host the Glaive also ricochets off of living enemies while dealing no damage. This has happened to me extensively in the past few matches, and it's very frustrating. :(

EDIT2: The Glaive hits multiple targets (if you can get it to ricochet in the right direction) both on the throw and the return.

Hello friends, my name is Twisted_Mentat (previously /u/Diali on Reddit) and I am here to bring you some news.  Test Clan Please Ignore, formed about one month ago here on Reddit, has undergone some management changes due to the previous Warlords taking a break from the game.  It has been left in my hands to manage alongside our current Leaders.

That being said, there's been a bit of a lull in these parts lately and I plan to revitalize our recruitment efforts to bring in new blood as well as liven up the chat and increase enthusiasm.  There are lots of things coming to Warframe in regards to clans and now is the best time to get a head start before Update 8 hits us.

If you'd like to join, make a post here and I will add you.  I will also be going back through the [old thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/18oojt/test_clan_please_ignore_if_youre_looking_for/?sort=new) to add anyone that may have been missed previously.

Also!  The clan Teamspeak is still available for those who want to get on and chat or talk with each other during parties.  It's been quiet recently but as we go on it'll probably become more populated as we get more things to do with each other.

It stacks multiplicatively. Examples:

* 1 player in the lobby, 3 join directly into the game: 200 armor * 0.95^5
* 2 players in the lobby, 2 join directly into the game: 200 armor * 0.95^6
* 3 players in the lobby, 1 joins directly into the game: 200 armor * 0.95^7
* 4 players in the lobby: 200 armor * 0.95^8

That is: armor * 0.95^(2n+m)  
Where **n** is the number of players in the mission lobby before it starts and **m** is the number of players that join after it starts.

According to this, maximum damage gain with 4 players having it in mission lobby is 50.73%. For pugs this would most likely be 29.24% (1 in lobby, 3 join after).

Stealth gameplay is incredibly unrewarding, and is in fact counter productive to the purpose of the game. There have been many-a-thread addressing this, and I think that if they implement a credit multiplier or XP multiplier for completing a mission in a stealthy way then I think the following is also necessary:

* When fighting enemies, if I can manage to break LoS, they should continue off in whichever direction I was previously headed. For instance, if as Ash or Loki I run through a door and immediately stealth, only to loop around behind them, they should continue through the door and right past me, leaving me free, and all baddies looking for me on the other side of the ship. *corollary 1* - *Enemies should split up when reaching a fork, with one group searching one way and a second searching the other, increasing realism and providing for a way to split up groups (grineer and corpus only)*

* Players should be able to hack consoles to turn off the alarm, after maybe 2 minutes of no LoS with baddies. This makes it possible to regain stealth.

* Players should be able to hack a console to turn off lights, but a failed attempt should result in the alarm being sounded

These are just my thoughts. Please, let me know what you think!

When we think Saryn, we think queen of poison. 3 of her 4 abilities use some sort of poison damage. Then i started to think about what could be done to help her in endgame (high level defense) because after about level 100 her ult only takes enemies to about half health (ancients). I was thinking that there should be more interaction between her abilities. Namely the ability to pop Venom sacs with her other abilities.

I think allowing contagion and miasma to have an impact on enemies with venom sacs would greatly improve Saryn's late game.

Example of the changes:

Venom: 
SARYN tags the target with a highly toxic spore that does poison damage over time.
Destroying the spore will trigger a viral infection to nearby enemies.

Change:
Saryn tags the target with a highly toxic spore that does poison damage over time.
Destroying the spore (including with contagion or miasma) will trigger a viral infection to nearby enemies.

Molt:
Shedding her skin like a snake, SARYN leaves a decoy behind to draw fire from enemies.

Change:
I would like this to stay the same but with one added ability, the ability to cast venom on the decoy, this will make it so attacking enemies have a chance to burst a venom sac on the decoy spreading the viral infection. 

Contagion:
SARYN channels high levels of toxicity into her melee weapon, transmitting disease and plague with each strike that connects with targets.

Change: 
Saryn channels high levels of toxicity into her melee weapon, transmitting disease and plague with each strike that connects with targets. If targets are afflicted with viral infection (venom) each successful hit will cause a toxic spore to be destroyed triggering a viral infection to nearby enemies.

Miasma:
Through noxious exhalation, SARYN pollutes the atmosphere with a lethally poisonous mist that corrodes all enemies in range, effectively disintegrating organic and synthetic matter instantly.

Change:
Through noxious exhalation, Saryn pollutes the atmosphere with a lethally poisonous mist that corrodes all enemies in range, effectively disintegrating organic and synthetic matter instantly. If targets are afflicted by toxic spores Miasma will instantly destroy all toxic spores causing the viral infection to spread instantly to anything that still lives. (in range)




I do not doubt that these changes may need balancing, but i think adding them will increase Saryn's skill cap and make playing her more fun. 

Now that i have written this up, let me hear what everyone thinks!
good or bad, let me know!

1372790528.0,49,self.Warframe,1hihwz,Sentinel Weapon Mods PSA - What mods not to use on your sentinel weapons,54,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1hihwz/sentinel_weapon_mods_psa_what_mods_not_to_use_on/,"First of all, according to both the wiki and the ""Stats 8.2"" datamined spreadsheet, every sentinel weapon has a 0% crit chance.

Taken from the wiki:
&gt;The bonus to critical chance is multiplicative with the base critical chance of the weapon. **The formula is (basecrit%)+(mod%*basecrit%).**

This means that **Point Strike** (Dethcube and Wyrm rifles) and **Pistol Gambit** (Shade's pistol) are entirely useless, since 0% + (any% x 0%) is 0%.

This *also* means that **Vital Sense** and **Target Cracker** mods are completely useless on Sentinel weapons.

Finally, taken again from the wiki:
&gt;These mods have been tested as NOT working (or unaffecting) on Wyrm's rifle:

* Ammo Drum (does not run out of ammo)
* Fast Hands (does not reload faster)
* Magazine Warp (approx. 7 bullets per magazine, does not increase the amount)

It is unconfirmed whether the same is applicable to the other sentinels, but it would make sense.

**TL;DR - Don't use Vital Sense, Target Cracker, Point Strike, or Pistol Gambit on your sentinel's weapons. Ammo Drum, Fast Hands, and Magazine Warp may also be a bad idea.**

If anyone can add to this information that would be greatly appreciated. I hope I have helped some of you choose your mods.",,False,self,t5_2urg0,False,,vauban,True,t3_1hihwz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1hihwz/sentinel_weapon_mods_psa_what_mods_not_to_use_on/,

1365849987.0,50,self.Warframe,1c9hyj,Tutorial: Get real-time desktop alert notifications directly from the developers.,68,18,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1c9hyj/tutorial_get_realtime_desktop_alert_notifications/,"So I'm going to quickly summarize how you can get desktop notifications (with popups and/or sounds) for your Warframe Alerts, so you can comfortably surf the Internet for lolcats without worrying about missing out on an alert. This is now a lot easier and more reliable thanks to the fact that Digital Extremes recently made an official alert Twitter feed.

So with so many options to keep track of alerts, you may be wondering why this tutorial is necessary. Well, the Warframe Alerts App is great, and I appreciate the effort, and the Alert Notification forum was great as well. They both have a serious drawback though - they require users to submit the alerts, and they require users to finish the mission before you can find out what the reward is. This often results in an awkward ten minutes of limbo for alerts, which is no longer necessary thanks to the Official Warframe Alert Twitter feed. This feed updates within a minute of most alerts appearing in game, and it has the reward listed right there.

Let's start with the program you will need. It is called Feed Notifier. This program is the least intrusive one I could find. It sits quietly in the tray using barely any resources, and updates at an interval you set, so it doesn't hog your bandwidth, and most importantly, it doesn't require any accounts, doesn't have any ads, is free, and generally is hassle free. The download for Windows is right at the top of their homepage, at http://www.feednotifier.com/

Once you have that installed, you're going to want to delete the default feed they put in there. You're installing this for a specific purpose, so I doubt you'll want that. Right click the tray icon, and go to preferences. Delete the default feed, and add a new one. Hit the add button, and in the ""Feed URL"" box, you'll want to put this URL: https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.rss?screen_name=WarframeAlerts

Hit Next. Change the feed title to Warframe Alerts, and change the other settings to your preferences. I suggest a polling interval of less than five minutes, since alerts are time limited, but you'll probably want something greater than two minutes. I keep mine at two. Hit Finish.

You aren't quite done yet. At this point, if you close the window, you will start getting alert notification ""toaster"" popups from your tray, with an associated sound to grab your attention. Clicking the tray icon will display the most recent alert. The problem, is that the alert feed also posts non-mystery (credit only) alerts. We can fix this, because they label mystery rewards with consistent identifiers: (Artifact) and (Blueprint) respectively. We will create a ""filter"" to block everything but these notifications. Alternatively, if credit rewards are your thing, you can scroll down to the end.

So hit the Filters button now, and click the Add button. INCLUDING the quotes, you'll want to set the filter rules to this: ""(Blueprint)"" or ""(Artifact)""

Uncheck the two options on the top right ""match whole words"" and whatever the other one is, and apply the filter only to the Warframe Alerts feed, by checking the ""Selected Feeds"" radio button. Hit okay, and make sure that filter is set to ""On"", signified by a check mark.

Lastly, if you want to change the sound to something more ""in character"" and/or scifi-ish, the WAV file is located at ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Feed Notifier\sounds\notification.wav"" (Depending on your operating system, you might want to remove the x86). I made one here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1032313/notification.wav

(The voice sample is from the War Friends Youtube video, which is hilarious - go watch it.)

1368736164.0,52,self.Warframe,1eh1e2,"I've loved this game so much that I recently passed the 240 hours or 10 days played mark ... but I'm becoming more and more wary of the ""nothing left to level"" dead-end.",56,4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1eh1e2/ive_loved_this_game_so_much_that_i_recently/,"I think the verdict is in that this game is without a doubt a ""gear-treadmill"".... albeit, an extremely fun version of one. That's not what bothers me as much as the sheer lack of direction if you acquire everything.

* DISCLAIMER: **NO I'M NOT LOOKING FOR PVP. YES I UNDERSTAND HOW LONG IT SHOULD TAKE TO LEVEL EVERY WF/WEAPON/MOD.**

While I do generally tend to be a bit 'hardcore' with games I choose to play I generally argue against any tiered reward system for 'hardcore' content... but I relentlessly campaign for there to be at least some rudimentary end-game content that serves as a means of competition that can be perpetuated - even if artificially imposed.

* *'Why do hardcore players need a perpetuating system? Why can't they just enjoy the game for what it is without a carrot to chase?'*

 **First off**, the obvious main reason is that a progression-based game without anything to progress is generally bad game design; after investing all that time and effort (and hopefully a bit of cash) to make that Frame better, that weapon stronger, and perfect that Mod-setup... and with everything in life, people inherently demand purpose &amp; value from their investments. The ""why can't you just enjoy using those items when you get them?"" rebuttal typically given at this point holds no water considering that if the game just gave you all such items from the start it would contain pathetically limited content.

Additionally, progression caps in progression game tend to fester a sour opinion of the game amongst those who - considering the amount of time devoted to it - should become its biggest fans. I know I don't want this game to grow a bad reputation, fade away, then lose any of the support that would go toward developing further content... but in this era of information sharing &amp; the importance of reputation, that's assured to happen if the hardcore base of players turn on any game.

...

**Secondly** - something I've noticed to be constant from one game to the next regardless of genre - is that regardless of their typically spiteful opinion of hardcore players ... the achievements and progress of the most hardcore players *always* serves as a net motivation factor for new incoming players. New players aren't stupid, they're just new; they know very well that progression is supposed to lead to somewhere and are always just as interested in where the road leads as those racing on it. Perhaps seeing the race inspires them to train &amp; prepare to compete themselves, or perhaps they are simply satisfied with knowing that their progression will always continue to lead somewhere... regardless, **new players are just as concerned about content 'dead-ends' as those nearing it.** What motivates new players to continue playing progression-based games is the reality that their character will become better today than it was yesterday, and ultimately measure their character against competition. As it stands, the PvE content is not competition.
_____

I don't claim to have the solution to the concern - merely emphasizing its existence - but really, all it takes is the implementation of a trivial means of competitive measurement. For the sake of examples here are a few suggestions off hand:

- Team Time-Trials &amp; Standings

While ""rushing"" is a bit controversial, time-trials are one of the easiest &amp; oldest systems of competition in gaming. While it wouldn't be a good idea for things like Assassinations/Rescue missions ... it would certainly be intriguing for Extermination or Defense mission. This would work really well with potential Stealth-based tasks that may require completing a mission without being seen.

- Defense Mission 'Leader Boards'

Quite simple concept of tracking the longest that teams have lasted in any given Defense mission. Easily measured in #Waves/#Enemies killed. Plenty of statistics could be incorporated such as the 'longest time defended before console takes damage', or 'quickest team to reach Wave X"". Theres virtually a limitless array of statistics in the form of standings would be more than enough to satiate the competitive urges of hardcore players. 

- Clan-Based ""Star Crawls""

This was my favorite idea I've had for a while which I've left to last to not bother anyone no longer reading ... but I really like the idea of being given a random pathway in a planetary system, being required to complete one mission after another in that order, having to use the same team of 4 players for the whole path, *and being given randomized restrictions along the way*. Restrictions such as only being allowed to use melee, randomized weapons, severely gimping 1 players' stats who must be escorted safely, or removing the map &amp; destination markers to force players to find the way out. The permutations would be practically infinite - great news to hardcore players - but the core function being to foster competitive cooperative teamwork that extends beyond singular missions &amp; extends to a chained sequence of missions. How such accomplishments would be measured and compared between clans/players would be debatable but the open-ended nature of the design leaves plenty of options.

.

______

**TLDR VERSION;** There remains an unrewarding hard cap on progression. The game in its current state leaves and players reaching that cap unsatisfied with the lack of content and purpose. Naturally it is the most hardcore players reaching this cap first. Hardcore players in any progression-based MMO - while not of any higher importance than casual players - inherently establish progression goals which motivate the new and lower level players by their competition. Displeased harcores typically translates into spiraling negative feedback that can starve the game from development resources it needs to improve content. MOST IMPORTANTLY - it would only take simple, trivial systems of competition to invigorate the most dedicated players and clans... and wouldn't require diverting very much time or resources at all to establish.

- Farming the Corrupters can be done from any Infested map, although it seems to have a higher drop rate the higher the level of the enemy.  That said, go do Xini.  By wave 15 you'll have enough of all 3 to join groups and get all 250 points.

- Each player can only equip one type (Alpha, Beta or Standard) of Corrupter.  Coordinate with your party to ensure that 1 of each is being brought to each mission.  Edit: As it was asked below, you equip the Corrupters like you would any of the ammo/health packs from your arsenal screen.

- Once you have a group of at least 3 (it's worth it, go to region chat and just coordinate if you don't have friends on) you will see a list of ships with % bars under them.  Go to the Planets named in each and click on the big ship floating there, this starts the mission.  Only players with some form of Corrupter equipped will be able to select the mission, but you can ride in if you're out.

- Once the mission starts you'll run along until you get to a big open room with 3 terminals in the middle.  Each of these terminals will have a prompt to insert an Alpha, Beta or Standard Module.  Do so as soon as you can.  Once the first is inserted it starts a mobile defense style countdown, each additional Corrupter inserted reduces the countdown and putting all 3 in reduces it to roughly 50 seconds.  Bringing all three means you get done faster!

- Once the countdown finishes, gtfo, obviously.

- At extraction, beside the credits you'll see a little symbol with a number beside it, that's your contribution to the mission, and it will be the same for all party members, depending on how many Corrupters you plugged in.   You get 3 points for just a Standard, 5 for a Standard + either an Alpha OR a Beta, 7 for an Alpha + Beta but no Standard, and 10 for all 3.  If you're running solo for some inexplicable reason (seriously, soloing this would take the max reward from 25 runs to 84, unless you are going to be doing this the entire weekend nonstop AND don't want a chance at leaderboards, pug it up in general chat) just bring Standard Corrupters.

- To emphasize: you get the points regardless of your contribution to the mission.  If you did cartwheels the entire time while your team plugged in 3 Corrupters, you get 10 points. (The author in no way endorses doing cartwheels the entire time while your team runs the mission.  If you feel the urge to do this please log off the game and lay down for a while until it goes away.)

- Each run seems to reduce the % of the ship by about 2, and they seem to regenerate something like 1% every 10 minutes, so try to focus your efforts on whichever one seems to be getting hit the hardest, otherwise your hard work is just getting regenerated.  Focus DPS!

1. ""Quantum"" - Antimatter seeking grenades that explode/implode on impact and deal damage to enemy and nearby enemies (more deployed as ranked up).
 
2. ""Matter Conversion"" Deals damage to a single target. If the target is killed, they become a 25 point energy orb. Higher ranks deal higher damage
 
3.  ""Gamma Ray"" By nuking one enemy with antimatter, Antimatter frame deals decent damage in a small area. (Gamma Rays are created by the annihilation of positrons)
 
4. ""Cherenkov"" The AM Warframe supercharges the matter inside target enemy causing them to explode in a bright blue (Cherenkov radiation color) explosion poisoning all enemies nearby (if dealing fatal damage) Causing them to radiate a bright blue (same as before) light that poisons all enemies nearby
 
5. ""Null Star"" Creates a mote of antimatter that  orbits around the Warframe which will seek out and collide with the nearest foe within a certain range. Motes last for a minute or until used. Maximum motes and number of mote spawned when activated increase with rank. Max Motes 2/4/8/12 Spawned per cast 1/1/2/3. Motes orbit for one second minimum before seeking a target.
 
6. ""Volatile"" Turns one enemy into a walking matter bomb, deals high damage to the target and small AOE damage to surrounding enemies when it dies.
 
CURRENT LEADER:  5.  ""Null Star""
 
2nd Power
 
1. ""Relativity Shift"" The Antimatter Warframe Shifts the molecules at target location in a phase of pure energy causing a blinding flash and a deafening bang that will stun enemies nearby. (Can not be used when in a hull breach situation since there will be no molecules to shift)
 
2. ""Flash"" Creates a few positive/negative particles in each hand and then claps creating a small explosion that blinds nearby enemies.Deals damage to enemies within 2 meters.*
 
3. ""Gravity Well"" Creates a medium-sized black dome over the targeted enemy and any enemies trapped within are crushed with intense gravitational pressure.
 
4. ""Antimatter Drop"" Shoot a contained bubble of antimatter. Slow projectile (but doesn't fall), explodes when shot or on collision. Amplified explosion if hit with a Matter Spike.
 
CURRENT LEADER:  4.  ""Antimatter Drop""
 
3rd Power
 
1. ""Vector"" Rains down with particles/gamma rays, doing light damage to nearby enemies, making them move slower for a while (Full armor piercing, no explosions but a nice after effect on the floor).
 
2. ""Wormhole"" The AM Warframe shifts the matter in the surrounding area creating a wormhole entrance at his current location and a wormhole exit at target location. The AM Warframe and allied Tenno can travel through this wormhole while enemies will be unable to see it. (Upgrading this skill allows for more uses)
 
3. ""Negative"" Coats your melee weapon with antimatter particles making it so that every time your attacks make contact there is an explosion,giving you extra damage and a minuscule AOE damage radius(charged attacks have a larger AOE).
 
4. ""Doppelganger"" Creates a dark-matter copy of any enemy the power is used on. This dark double retains all the abilities of the original however will fight for the player. The double will degrade due to reaction with matter in air and will explode on death.
 
CURRENT LEADER:  2.  ""Wormhole""
 
4th Power
 
1. ""Molecular Prime"" - Primes all enemies in a radius with antimatter. Upon death the antimatter and matter collide causing high damage in a certain radius. The explosions can kill other primed enemies and set off more explosions. Can kill new enemies in explosion radius. Good for chain reaction explosions. 
 
2. ""World Collider"" - Spawns a clone of self at target location. It then starts to sprint towards the caster, when they meet matter and anti-matter collide causing a massive explosion. the greater the distance traveled by the anti-matter clone the greater the damage.
 
3. ""Annihilation"" - Casts two orbs in both hands: White and Black (Matter and Anti-Matter). The Warframe would then make a circular motion similar to Yin and Yang and press the orbs together, creating a blinding flash with an instantaneous explosion that knocks back enemies similar to Banshee's Sonic Boom.
Enemies caught in the radius are dealt devastating damage while enemies within viewing distance are blinded.
 
4. ""Explosion"" - Converts all ground in front of you into antimatter. All matter touching this will trigger an explosion. Last upto 7 sec. 40 meter cone.

For example, i like to use Ash with rush and thief's wit, gorgon, and shade for material farming, and saryn with focus, continuity, stretch, dethcube, latron for defense mission. What if there were three (or more) preset load outs which could be changed (setup any way you like) by the player. Each load out would change the warframe, weapons, sentinel and mods associated with each. This would allow you to have a setup for endless defense mission, boss runs, material farming, void misssions etc. which you could easily switch too. The preset buttons could be placed beside the Inventory/Mods/Back buttons in the arsenal screen. Does anyone else find themselves switching around warframes/weapons/mods often?

1374038338.0,48,self.Warframe,1igunj,A radical warframe suggestion: Warzones.,64,16,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1igunj/a_radical_warframe_suggestion_warzones/,"SETTING:
Basically a warzone is a super level that takes up a large portions of a planet's terrain and has persistent events happening on it. A warzone can take up to ten or fifteen 4 person squads at a time, and instead a random tile set it is styled beautifully after the planet's terrain, like on earth you'll have a post apocalyptic jungle, on Neptune you'll be fighting on top of ships floating above the watery surface, and on mars you'll be fighting along the red sand deserts and its inner network of tunnels. Each warzone has its own unique infested fauna and is chock full of resources if you're willing to explore the warzone. Also unlike levels the warzone continually exists, is always unlocked from level one, and is changing with new events by the minute, with factions gaining and losing footholds to each other, fighting each other, and affecting their environment, even if not a single player is playing in them.

OBJECTIVE:
In these beautifully rendered expanse levels there are several posts, the overall objective while playing in a warzone is to have the largest percentage of these posts under Tenno rule, but this is not easy as the other factions like grineer and corpus will also make appearances and try to claim posts as well especially including the fact that the war never ends. And if you fail to maintain the largest share of posts disorder will occur in that planet's system and you may end up having jackals in mercury, basically the strength of the winning faction will be amplified greatly. But holding the largest share of posts in the warzone is not your only objective, as every squad has a different objective on entry, whether its to sabotage grineer mining machines (which you will see in action in the warzone) or steal a powerful weapon from a corpus camp, you'll have an ever changing objective in the great faction war to provide Tenno victory which you will be rewarded for upon completion. Levels in the warzone vary greatly giving new players an actual chance and high level players endgame content, a grineer commander may be level 57 but a non elite grineer lancer would be level 17 and so forth. Don't worry even if you can't survive a warzone you can help by completing as many missions as you can as it weakens forces in the Warzones. 

Note, that you cannot revive when you die in a warzone you'll simply have to cue in again. And only major planets have warzones.

EVENTS:
The most alluring part of these Warzones is the pure randomness of things on the battle field, while you have the factions openly shooting at each other in the fray, you and your squad may find a nest of hibernating raptors waiting to demolish the Tenno defenses, or a stealthed Hek platoon may ambush your team,or may find a bunker full of nano spores and so forth. All while dodging grineer tanks, fire from over head corpus ships, poisonous long range volleys from the infested. Your objective will change and it will come up to you to attack your enemy vitally, or save the Tenno forces. Not including the special one time only events that can occur in a warzone, like a warzone only boss appearing at nightmare difficulty (we're talking huge and able to kill in one hit) and suddenly all the squads have to converge to defeat it, and factions may even ally together in pressing events. Don't worry you'll get warzone specific prizes like titled helmets that boast of your glory in war.

So I present to you the following album: http://imgur.com/a/PMN0r

If you scroll through there you will see three loadouts (control, one element, all elements). The damage totals **clearly** show more damage on the ""all elements"" loadout. Much more importantly though, the ""all elements"" loadout shows damage from more sources (the number of damage mods applied).

Other notes:

* I didn't put serration or multishot on for the sake of simplicity
* No crit numbers were shown to pollute the data
* Several shots *were* fired but I didn't upload them all for the sake of brevity.

I believe this claim came about and was rightly identified by /u/Keetsune. If you kill a mob with an single attack with multiple damage sources, not all of the damage numbers are popped up.

I decided to make a huge post listing the prices and resources required for each room you can build. But first, lets go over the basics.

First off, you start off with 1 Clan Hall. It's a standard room, with one door at each end. You also get 100 Capacity and 5 Energy. Capacity and Energy are used to create rooms, and each type of room takes (or gives) different amounts of these resources.

Now, onto the actual rooms.

WEEK 1:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1cibfu/subs_weekly_bugs_thoughts_and_suggestions_week_1/



This is the third week of constant warframe.  I played during christmas for about a month after the holiday, but got bored due to the lack of content at the time (this was in closed beta).  This game is fantastic and has a lot of potential, but there are a lot of bugs and plenty of things to address!  There are also come core design changes that the game is BEGGING to have, just by how it plays right now.



**BUGS** (Boring part first)

----

The map will still 'lose' the waypoint sometimes, and the player  will have to guess where to go until they finally find the objective. This can be especially irritating during boss farms.  Wouldn't be a problem if the maps didn't use the same tiles several times during a mission, which prevents the player from making a mental map of the area.

During the 'fly-in' cinematic, strange colored artifacts will appear on the screen for most players.

Headshot counter on end-game scoreboard still very unreliable. Almost arbitrary.

Large melee weapons, like the Bo, Gram or Fragor will occasionally 'stick' to the player's hands while they try to use other weapons.  No gameplay effect, but very comical.

Phorid and Ancients will occasionally knock a player through geometry, which will either trap the player indefinitely, or knock them out of the map, killing them, and forcing them back to start.

Some of ember's abilities to attribute damage and kills to the player on the end game scoreboard, or with affinity.

Occasionally, wall running on a small object will violently fling the player across the room.

Bronco will occasionally get in a reload loop where it will constantly try to reload. This usually happens when the player is sprinting, and will stop when the player stops.

Fast weapons, like the dual zoren, will occasionally get stuck in a 'half-charge' mode, where the player will continue to do half charge attacks when the melee button is held. To stop this, player must stop attacking.

The Shade's 'ghost' ability will not give the player melee crits, because the player will lose invisibility during the wind up of their melee attack, rather than after the attack. Not sure if this is intentional.

During hectic defense on Xini with max number of players, occasionally mod effects will drop out of the player (like magazine size and sprint speed). This is only fixed when the game is restarted.  Exact trigger unknown.

**THOUGHTS AND SUGGESTIONS**

----

DE. I double dog dare you to make an enemy or boss who doesn't rely on stagger.  You guys put stagger and knockdown in everything, and I think you have an addiction to it.  This is an intervention. The following enemies have knockdown or stagger as an ability (not counting melee on grineer):  Phorid (2x), Shockwave Moa, Sniper Moa, Rollerballs, Ancients, Crawlers, Chasers, Runners, Leapers, Jackal, Hyena, Heavy Gunners, Bombards, Napalm Bombards, Lasers.

I mean, knockdown and stagger are fine when used properly, but when you've got them on almost every single enemy it becomes tiresome and annoying. Can't tell you how many times I've died because I've been stunlocked by Phorid and 2 ancients.

Knockdown would also be fine if it didn't take my **highly agile, super-inshape space ninja** a whole five minutes to stand up.  I can wall run, but I can't stand up quickly?

Here's what I suggest instead:

**Freeze**:  Hit the player with cold damage, causing them to move a bit slower. Rolling will help lose the cold damage faster.  Frost should be immune to this. (Btw, I think Warframes should have more innate stats and passives)

**Electrical Damage**: If a player is hit with electrical damage, their aim should be jostled during the duration of the damage, but they should not be stunned. Fuck realism.  Volt should be immune to this.

**Blind**: If a player is hit with 'blind'. You can do either one of two things. Cover the screen in gooey globs that slowly slide down the screen, OR, lower the brightness around the peripheries so they can only see a small distance around them.  Ash should be immune to this.

**Jam**: Jam the player's weapon for a short duration, forcing them to use an ability or melee, or switch weapons. Would be an excellent boss ability. Excalibur should be immune to this.

**Weakness/Lethargy**:  Should decrease jump height, running speed, and melee attack damage, and also slow down reload speed.  Rhino should be immune to this.

**Heat Aura**:  Around a fire-type enemy, it should deal heat damage, which slowly drains both shields and health at the same time.  Ember should be immune to this.

**Deafen**: An enemy can give out a loud shreak, just like the Phorid, which causes them to stumble, go deaf, and their UI should break for a short period of time.  Banshee should be immune to this.

**Pull/Push**: Players can be slowly sucked in towards an enemy, and the only way to escape would be to sprint in the opposite direction.  Mag should be immune to this.

**Poison**: You already have it.  Saryn should be immune though.

**Confusion**:  A enemy could split into many different copies, but only one of them is the real one. Loki should be immune to this.

**Possessed**: A player's controls could be reversed, or they could attack their teammates while the effects persists. Nyx would be immune to this.

Those are all the things that I can think of that you can use besides motherfuckin' stagger, which would also challenge and terrify the player.


::Moving on!::

**Stalker** needs to drop something when you kill him... or someting. I don't know, he needs something more to him. Perhaps he could be controlled by another player, dark souls style.

 ::Gametypes and Maps::

This is my favorite part, so get ready to get your mind blown.

Right now we need more gametypes, as what we have right now is really samey and homogenous.  Raid and Capture are the same Objective, just one has more screaming.  This game BEGS for more open gameplay. Here are my suggestions:

**Demolition**: The Grineer/Corpus have a communications array on a planet that needs to be destroyed (basically, a big giant sattelite.).  It sits on top of a mountain with little outposts all around it.  You can choose which side you want to approach from, but it's all open gameplay on the way up. You can stealth your way up, or go full out, but if you set off the alarm, giant turrets on the walls at compound you're trying to get to will start shooting giant balls of energy (Tribes Ascend style) at you.  Whoever gets to the top first can hack or destroy the turrets. Hacked turrets can shoot at enemies and everyone will get the affinity for it.  Inside, the player will have to place a bomb in the center of the compound which will cause the reactor inside to go critical.  The players will have a short countdown to escape as parts of the compound explode. To escape, they must *slide down the motherfuckin' mountain as shit blows up around them*.  Imagine it. You're sliding down with crap blowing up behind you, doing ninja flips over obstacles, and style-headshotting enemies in your way, until you roll into the exit and fly away just in time.

**New Maptype: City Block**
This would work great for Spy missions, and would really let players stretch their Orokin-tech legs with all the things to climb and jump on.  A cordoned off city block with many different interiors for the players to go in.  They would have to find different panels throughout the city block to hack to get the data-mass.  Players could split up, or take it on closed-fist style, but there would be countless of ways to approach each area. Grineer could really shiny as they work great in interior and exterior settings.  Ballista could set up on roofs, heavy gunners could sit at checkpoints,  and assault teams could ambush and close off players who move through the interior of buildings.  For the corpus, cameras could turn on powerful turrets which would target the player, but if the player finds the 'comm station' they could shut them all down, which could be a priority for a stealth player as it would no doubt be heavily guarded.  For infection, the cramped alleyways and countless dead ends inside the buildings would create quite interesting gameplay for the players who make the right and wrong decisions in these situations.  Additionally, an ancient in a small room would be nothing to trifle with.

**Map-Type: Desert Outpost**: Players could start on the outside of an outpost in a sand-dune desert, either at night, or during the day.  It would be guarded and patrolled, and players would have to find a way to sneak in, or just smash open the gate and wreck face. The players would have to hack key points in the compound in order to open up a door which would lead down into the planet's crust, where the boss fight or objective would take place.  On the way back, they'd have to fight up through this tunnel which would no doubt be full of enemies waiting to make them suffer... unless of course they stealthed their way through.


**BOSSES**

I don't want to get into the current bosses, as I know they're all going to be overhauled quite soon, but I had some ideas for some that you might want to hear.

**Sniper Sisters**.  The grineer could have four legendary sniper sisters which would be cool in a large open map.  The player would have to track each down and keep mobile as each sniper would try to cover the other. Stealthy players would shine, and so would clever fast-moving players.  Slower players would have to rely on teamwork.

**Chandlefear** A giant (like, taking up the whole god damn ceiling of a boss room) hanging amalgamation of flesh which would constantly fire  globs of acid at the player.  Once it runs out of 'ammo' so to speak it would hang low from the ceiling to 'rest' which would give the player time to melee the crap out of it.  Standing too close to the walls would expose the player to tentacles which would whack the player back towards the center, where sticky tentacles await to pull the player up for a snack. The only way to release the tentacles would be to shoot at the glowing blemishes at the corner of the thing's  'mouth'.

**Apotheosis** A giant mech operated by several Corpus.  Would be quite mobile and constantly try to strafe the player.  The player could only destroy it by 'stunning it' (done by attacking an energy cell on its back) and doing damage to the armored corpus inside. If a Corpus is killed, that section of the mech no longer works.  One arm should have a flame thrower, another a missile launcher, and the pilot should control the movement.





::**HEAVY WEAPONS**::

We need em. But not that badly. Just some ideas that would fit the warframe universe.  All heavy weapons should slow down the player (except for the Rhino), but have tremendous potential to wreak havoc.  None of these weapons are named, just described.

**Charge-Shot Plasma Cannon**  Basically, samus's arm cannon, except bigger. Would be carried underarm, like a minigun.

**Cone of Damage Cannon.** Not sure if it would be plasma, or microwave beams, or whatever , but not fire, as you would still be able to put elemental damage mods onto it.  Pretty simple concept really. Also under-arm, like a minigun.

**Piercing railgun**. A weapon which would fire a line of damage that would pierce through many enemies, and do severe knockback to whatever it doesn't kill.

**Grenade Launcher** Pretty self explanatory.

***Full experiment results available [in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1e3828/so_does_staying_together_on_kappa_make_a/).***

***Experiment Part 1 Data [available here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AtXUBcfcXc29dGI1QWo2bVhxUzUybW55RTlwRk5oS0E&amp;gid=0)***

***Experiment Part 1 Data screenshots [available here.](http://imgur.com/a/Nt7HT)***


________
**Hypothesis :**

If a team stays together at each defense point, the team will earn more XP. 

**Test :** 

Five rounds will be played together as a team. Five rounds will be played as each player sees fit. 
______
**Help Needed :**

I need three other players to be with me for five rounds. They must stay in the same room as the objective as best they can during the five rounds. You will serve as both teammates and witnesses to the experiment to prevent my own bias.

Then we will evaluate if the same three players will remain as part of the second part of the experiment. If a new team must be formed for the second leg of the experiment, I will post here for volunteers.

Finally, a second test of five rounds will be conducted. Players may mill about while the timer counts down at each defense point. 

**Tenno Requirements** :


A level 30 Tenno would be best, but if the player has weaponry to compensate, this is acceptable. It would also be optimal if the Tenno had a fully leveled damage AoE to help demolish waves of Grineer.

I will be playing as a level 30 Frost.
_________
**Backstory :**

While farming XP, mods, Rubedo and Alloy Plate on Senda :: Kappa, I have been of the understanding that more enemies will come to you if the team stays by the objective. **I believed the result was *more* XP, *more* potential for mods, and *more* potential for material drops.** I had an argument with another player while farming Kappa, and decided to try and figure this out once and for all. Thank you in advance for help, volunteering.

**Disclaimer** : 

If mods determine this post is not suitable for this subreddit, please let me know. Otherwise, thank you for the opportunity to work together and put my belief to the test.

***Update 1 (May 8, 4.00PM EST) : Time frame for this experiment will be from 8.30AM - 4PM EST (12.30PM - 8PM GMT).*** 

***Update 2 (May 9, 12.10AM EST) : Will begin sending friend requests in game when I sign in tomorrow. Please send a direct message with your username in game if you would like me to add you to the pool. I will likely take the first three players I see are online. Looking forward to updating you all tomorrow. Until then, fellow Tenno.***

***Update 3 (May 9, 8.42AM EST) : Sent requests to those who provided names. If I missed you, please send me a friend request in-game. I will be farming Volt parts until I have a full group and we can proceed with the first half of the experiment.***

***Update 4 (May 9 12.15PM EST) : Finally have a full group. Phase one commencing.***

***Update 5 (May 9 1.39PM EST) : Was just about to finish 3rd run when DE released update. Stuck just outside extraction until we get the green light.***

***Update 6 (May 9 2.43PM EST) : Finished the first half of the experiment. Have some raw data to sort out, and eager to start the 'Everyone Run About' phase tomorrow. After that, I intend to try and present the data in a spreadsheet form for easy consumption.***

***Update 7 (May 10 9.12AM EST) : Put the data into a spreadsheet format, also posted a link to the screenshots where I collected the data from. Going to see if I can whip together four rounds of willy-nilly Mobile Defense Kappa today. However, due to unforeseen consequences, this may not happen until next Friday.***

***Update 8 (May 10 4.38 EST) : Final update (for now?). Performed experiment with a couple of modifications. Thank you all for your input. This was a fun experiment, and would enjoy doing more in the future!***

I made it into a executable so you don't need to have Python installed on your computer or anything to run it.

It uses the mods that drop in waves 5 and 10 to determine what has a chance to drop in waves 15 and 20, and then uses subsequent rewards to refine its accuracy for future predictions. I'm not a particularly adept programmer but I have used this program a fair bit and haven't had it throw errors or fail to list a reward that then showed up as the actual reward.

If you're looking for defense missions that start with tier 3 rewards I believe the following are popular:

Corpus (can reward Master Thief): Narcissus on Pluto

Grineer (can reward Handspring): Casta on Ceres

Infested (can reward Thunderbolt): Xini on Eris 

Here's the program:

If you really want to encounter him is here a little guide.  
Take your fastest Warframe (Ash with max sprint for exemple) add a shade sentinel is a plus too.  
Go on Jupiter - Themisto and rush trough the mission, kill the J3-Golem quikly and rush to the exit ( this take around 2-3 minutes).  
Then go on Mercury - M prime wich is a low level raid mission (looking for orokin artifact) and rush trough the mission without even taking down the ennemies (this should take you around 2-4 min). Repeat M prime until the Stalker shows up (and he will) then go again for J3 (rince and repeat).   
Don't forget to go invite only, solo, or private, other pub player will slow you down.

Now, while farming, I've noticed something peculiar: if Raptor doesn't drop what they want, some players abort mission right there, which is odd, considering the extraction is never more than one or two tiles away from the boss arena tile. Now this was annoying, but tolerable. They just lost out on all the mods, credits, and resources by being impatient assholes. However, this latest run Raptor finally dropped the Chassis I was looking for. So everything's all well and good. But no. The host decides to DC and it has to migrate, which means I lost not only the multitude of mods that dropped and a lucky Control Module, but also that Chassis, all because someone was too impatient to walk another tile or two further.

* Weapons by themselves don't determine what will happen to the enemy you hit, **damage type** does
* Each enemy has its own damage type handlers, thresholds for each damage type and effects for each damage type
* Each enemy has a list of protected (armor) body parts; it can range from none to all body parts
* Each enemy has weak body parts, they can be protected by armor (read above)
* Melee weapons can hit twice with slams; if you're close enough you will hit with slam damage (affected by slam radius from my weapon stats spreadsheet) AND jump attack damage (affected by melee radius from my weapon stats spreadsheet)
* Expanding on the fact that damage types affect what happens to an enemy, if a melee weapon doesn't have knockdown damage type in either slam or jump attack, it will not knock enemies down (on slam attack)
* When playing defense missions (not mobile defense), maximum number of enemies per wave depends on wave number (among other things) and it caps at wave 10
* When playing mobile defense missions, maximum number of enemies is capped between 50 to 70 depending on what you're defending; staying in the room is thus the most efficient as enemies will not be getting stuck and will be spawning optimally
* When playing any mission, number of active enemies is limited by number of players and mission settings; player multipliers are (in order): 0.9, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0
* If you get near a spawning point, enemies will stop spawning/will not spawn

How about a map overlay that we can zoom in and out that shows all the rooms we've been in, so we know how to navigate.  would be a lot better than the current system, and would force us to explore without being completely lost!

Rather than a dash to the finish, the game would have more exploration.

Hell, do away with waypoint system entirely, and just have a minimap plus a map overlay that is revealed as you explore.  Straight up *apeing* this system from diablo and path of exile would fit this game well.

Hack a console in the map, and it will reveal the location (relative to yours) of the boss room/objective room.


I love you DE, but the UI and map has got to be the worst aspect of Warframe. It's a big sore spot in a beautiful game, and I think it's a priority.

I would say 'quit adding weapons and focus on upgrading the UI' but I know better than this. Different teams work on different things.  I just know that this should really be a priority.  The UI has the same bugs and the same design problems that it's had since I joined closed beta back in early december.


But remember, we love you DE.


((Some history regarding the map overlay.  Diablo was not the first game to have one. It was a popular map display system that was featured in plenty of games back in the day.  Doom, Heretic, Terminal Velocity and Duke Nukem 3D are some well known old games that had this feature.  Diablo took a step further and added lots of detail to the overlay, and making it's background transparent as a default.))",,False,self,t5_2urg0,1370931351.0,,banshee-reverb,True,t3_1g3sbx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1g3sbx/de_can_we_get_a_diablopath_of_exile_style_map/,

-Vauban's Bounce can also be used as a way to boost players forward. If you see a door, run through it, and place a launch pad on the side you're now on. Players that run through the door will now be boosted forward! Excellent if you're far ahead of your team and want to speed up your teammates. Use this with caution, though; if you're backtracking or you hit the wrong side, it'll slow you down considerably. Additionally, you can cast Bounce while wallrunning. Place a Bounce on a wall, wallrun into it (without directly jumping onto it) and jump off as you pass over it, and you'll launch yourself away from the wall very quickly, but without any vertical movement.

-Vauban's Vortex is bugged, currently, and it shouldn't affect players. However, you can take advantage of this bug to jump massively high. As you run towards a vortex, jump, and you'll float upwards with no regards for the laws of physics. Combine this with a high wall and a well placed Bounce for massive jumps.

-Playing as Nova, and see a spot that your Wormhole can't directly reach? Aim it at a wall! Sprint and jump through your Wormhole and you should be able to wallrun as you exit. If you're hosting, this might not work, since your camera automatically repositions to where you teleported from.

-Nova's Antimatter Drop can be shot to amplify its damage, dealing 4x the damage it takes at max level. This can lead to *massive* nukes of 10k+ damage, enough to kill almost anything.

-Nova's Molecular Prime also slows afflicted enemies and causes them to take double damage.

-Combine Excalibur's Super Jump and the Heavy Impact mod. Your Super Jump now has much more use!

-Ash's Smokescreen and Loki's Invisibility both increase your melee damage by a large percent.

-Ash's Teleport can be used to jump to teammates, not just enemies!

-Use Banshee's Sonar with an extremely quick weapon for massive damage. Flux Rifle and Spectra are exceptional at this in particular.

-Shooting through Volt's Electric Shield with weapons that don't have built-in armor ignoring properties adds an extra 50% electric damage. You can shoot through and take cover behind either side of the shield, as well.

-As a Nyx, tell your teammates to avoid shooting the targets you're using Mind Control on. Heavy Gunners can really lay down some pain, if you let them.

This post's soundtrack: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUOAxurw-lQ&amp;list=PL43C5A2E1CAD93C46

Last night after a bout of shouting at people outside my window and yelling at small animals, I had an idea for  a warframe whose theme was high mobility, and fast attack.  I also wanted to come up with a warframe that had spammable abilities.

I also think level 1 projectile damage abilities should be much much cheaper. As of right now, they're ALL too expensive to be viable, on every frame.

Almost all slot 1 damage abilities are completely useless right now.  With the possible exception of Frost's, but not really.

I also wanted to come up with a highly effective frame that didn't rely on being tanky or being a DPS slut.  Loki is the only 'high skilled required' frame in the roster right now, and I think he needs a friend.

ABILITIES
 (ALL COULD BE USED IN AIR, BECAUSE THAT'S THE POINT)



---------------

**SLOT 1** : Blast

Jet extends his hand forward and emits a high energy burst of concussive propellent that can cut through flesh and armor alike.

It would perform somewhat like a short range railgun, cutting through multiple enemies at once but only in a line.

**Cost: 10 Energy**

Range: 3 / 3 / 5 / 8 meters.

Damage: 50 / 75 / 150 / 200

**Cast Time: 0.2s**

------

**SLOT 2 :**  Dash Jet

Small engines in Jet's suit emit a powerful propellant, sending him quickly in a direction of his choosing.

Would operate similarly to slash dash, except it would send the player further in the direction he/she was already going, and at shorter range. This ability would be meant to be spammed often in order to dart between enemies rapidly. The player could also shoot and do melee while this ability was active.

It would do absolutely zero damage though.

Cost: 5 Energy

Range: 4 / 4 / 6 / 8

Damage: N/A

**Cast Time: Instant, otherwise what would be the point?**

----

**SLOT 3 :**  Afterburner

Engines on Jet's back would propel him forward in a straight line. As long as the ability is active, the player can shoot or use abilities (except for dash jet) in any direction while being propelled, but cannot change direction.

Cost: 15 per second / 10ps / 5 ps

Range: As long as the button is held and as long as the frame still has energy.

Damage: N/A

Cast time: 1s

----

**SLOT 4 :** Fuel Dump

Using an excessive amount of energy, jet can create a massive jet of plasma flame in front of him, doing damage in massive cone, rather than a typical spherical AOE.  Would have longer range than a normal, spherical AOE,  but would be directional. Less of an 'ohshit button' and more of a planned hit-and-run as it wouldn't work very well if you were surrounded.

Cost: 100

Range: 10 / 12 / 15 / 20

Damage: 1000 / 1000 / 1200 / 1500

Cast time: 1s


Base Stats: Same as Excals.

As we all know, certain mods are extremely rare and can make or break a weapon or play style. I'm talking about things like Thunderbolt and Multishot, and to a lesser extent, Flow and Continuity. These cannot be bought, and changes the power of weapons significantly. In the case of the Paris, it turns a useless weapon into something quite powerful. This makes these mods extremely high value, which is a property shared by certain ? alerts. 

 Random drops and alerts do not give the player any control over their progress, which makes farming them frustrating and unfulfilling. From my own stats, I have a 0.0027% of finding a multishot from the Grineer, which is stupid. It is a vital mod for gameplay that cannot be obtained with any reliability.

The true king has a much humbler name.",51,7,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1guzgv/do_not_worship_the_false_king_grakata_the_true/,"I often see people cite the Grakata as one of the highest DPS in the game *when fully modded*. While this isn't false per se, I feel that it's important to let people know that the Grakata isn't the only option for SMG style slaughter. The Braton can be modded to match the Grakata's damage dealing capabilities. Although the Braton loses in terms of lifetime per magazine and reserve ammo (overall ammo efficiency is similar if you do not use an ammo pack), it is *far* superior in recoil characteristics and cone of fire, giving it more effective range than the Grakata.

Braton:

* Serration
* Split Chamber
* Speed Trigger
* Vital Sense
* Base DPS: 2030
* +4 elements
* DPS total: 8729 
* Time per mag: 2.49s 

Grakata: 

* Serration
* Split Chamber
* Point Strike
* Vital Sense
* Base DPS: 2061 (1.5% more)
* +4 elements
* DPS total: 8865
* Time per mag: 3.0s

While the time per magazine is significantly less on the Braton, the difference in accuracy is enormous. You can literally hold the trigger down for the entire 2.5 seconds and still be more accurate than a medium-burst firing Grakata. It is for this reason alone that the Braton is the real SMG King; incredible damage output while maintaining an excellent cone of fire.

1367632781.0,42,self.Warframe,1dnnoj,Warframe on Linux,43,1,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1dnnoj/warframe_on_linux/,"EDITS:
One: Fixed my sound issue, xact was not installed correctly, I to force install xact_jun2010.
Two: Apparently with U8, 64bit mode works. Your mileage will vary, but it's working for me.

Hello Warframers. So, there has been some talk about how to get this fine game working on Linux Systems. Well, I'm happy to announce that I, after like two weeks of fucking with it, got it working quite well. And by ""quite well"", I can login, join my friends clan, shoot things in the face, and have fun.

So the rundown. I have to play in fullscreen mode or else I lag to all hell, but meh.

Step one, download and install wine and winetricks. These should be in your distros repos, else get them from http://www.winehq.org/ (for wine) and https://code.google.com/p/winetricks/ (for winetricks). Use of the latest versions of these libs is highly recommended.

Step two, run **winetricks d3dx9 xact** (or **/path/to/winetricks.sh d3dx9 xact** if the package manager didn't install winetricks). This will install some of the dependencies Warframe needs in your wine prefix. **D3dx9** is Directx9 and **xact** is the Xaudio2 engine.

Step 3, download the Warframe.msi and run **wine msiexec /i /path/to/Warframe.msi**. This will start the launcher.

Step 4, ~~***DISABLE 64-BIT MODE IN THE LAUNCHER SETTINGS!*** It **DOES NOT WORK RIGHT**, and you're going to have a bad time.~~ With U8 (for me anyways), 64-bit mode is working. I get slightly higher FPS (maybe 5-10fps more). You can try it, but I advise against it unless you can fix any issue that arises.

Step 5, By now, hopefully, the launcher will be complaining about not being able to find *~/.wine/drive_c/users/&lt;user_name&gt;/Local Settings/Application Data/Warframe/Downloaded/Public/Tools/Launcher.exe*. Cd into that directory and run **mv Launcher.exe.tmp Launcher.exe**. Click **Retry** in the launcher, and you should (with fingers crossed) be greeted with a login prompt. Type in your login information and press the **Login** button.

Now, one of two things will happen. You will either be greeted with the Licensing conditions, or a popup stating that it could not login to the server because it couldn't find it. For the former, Congrats! Enjoy Warframe in Linux my fellow Penguino! For the latter, be need to get dirty.

Step 6  aka **DEFCON 5**, If you're greeted with the **Could not find Server** popup, it means wine is being a PITA and you need to whip it into shape. You need to install the 'lib32-openal', 'lib32-libxml2', 'lib32-mpg123', 'lib32-giflib', 'lib32-libpng', and 'lib32-gnutls' packages (these are the names Arch Linux gives these packages, you may need to Google for the correct names for your distro) one by one and keep trying to login. You could get lucky and just be missing a dependency that's not letting you log in.

Step 7 aka **DEFCON 3**, Install *https://github.com/madewokherd/wine-mono*. Wine-mono is a drop in replacement for the .NET libs in Wine. It's also big as hell, and you're going to need to compile it yourself. If your running Arch Linux, it's in the AUR (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wine-mono/). This will take some time, but it solved the above *""Could not find Server""* issue for me.

Step 8 aka **DEFCON 1**, Compile wine from source. It's a long shot, but I've read successful installs of Warframe when most other methods failed.

***TIPS*** *(I'll update this with more tips from other people once they come in)*

If the preprocess crashes, run the launcher in a terminal. That seems to work for me.

If ALSA doesn't work (and you don't get the *""Could not find XAudio2 Engine""* error), try seeing if the *snd_seq* kernel mod is loaded. I know that it was complaining at me for that, and that may solve some sound issues for some people.

If Sound doesn't work (or you get the *""Could not find XAudio2 Engine""*), try running **winetricks --force xact_jun2010**. 

Turn off all the fancy stuff in the game options. The game will run better, and you'll have less texture corruptions.

In our clan, we wanted to build 3 cross connectors in a line coming off of the main clan room, so that we can build the oracle and all the labs, and still have room for expansion. We just got done with one of the side connectors and one of the ends is marked with a nice big ""DEAD END"" on it. 

Apparently there isn't enough space (although there certainly looks like there should be) to build in the space right next to the main room. I am not sure if this is a bug or planned. The main thing that irks a lot of us in our clan is that we are a pretty small clan, and we cannot afford to find out these complications by experience. 

Here are a couple images to explain what I am talking about.

1) players often call them ""potatoes"", on account that that look vaguely like one. Catalysts are ""blue"" potatoes while Reactors are ""red"" or ""gold"" potatoes


2) both potato types work by doubling your mod capacity for your weapon/frame. 


3) the potato SCALES WITH LEVEL, so it doesn't matter WHEN you add it. If you add it at 1 you get 2 slots per level. If you add it at 30 you end up with 60.


4) for emphasis, I REPEAT: IT DOES NOT MATTER when you insert your potato. If you like your frame/weapon and are sure you wanna keep it, potato it at any time, and the end effect will be the same. 


Thank you.

5) Once you attach a 'tater, YOU CAN NOT GET IT BACK. EVER.

Anyway!

It's been a while since the discussion on picking your frame's gender (female Ash, male Mag, etc.), both for us and DE as far as I can tell. If I remember correctly, the major sticking point was that the devs were still on the fence about whether they wanted frames to just be suits, or to instead be distinct characters with their own personalities. I think we're sort of leaning towards the latter right now, but from a lore standpoint, this becomes kind of problematic when you have a group with duplicates of the same frame. Are they all that same character? Are they clones?

I've been kicking around an idea that would split the difference between the two extremes (frames as suits/frames as characters). What if wearing a particular frame causes you to take on the personality of the ancient Tenno warrior who inspired the frame's creation?

To flesh this out a bit:

Say there was a real Vauban, in the bygone era before contemporary Tenno went into cryosleep. This historical Vauban died long ago, but the Tenno of the present become him whenever they wear the frame dedicated to his image. This has all sorts of cool cultural undertones in  an honorable warrior society: distinguish yourself and become a legend in your own right, and perhaps one day a Warframe will be dedicated to you. Immortalizing your legend as a warrior is a very literal truth in Tenno society.

Of course, this does have a darker side. If modern Tenno are spending the vast majority of their time in suits that turn them into other people (and more than a few, including the player character, have lost their memory due to cryosleep), what time do they have to be themselves? Who's to say that they aren't slowly losing their own personalities, in favor of the frame's? If you subscribe to the idea that the Lotus may not have our best interests at heart, who's to say that this wasn't her plan all along - to mold us into a race of soulless, fanatically loyal copies of history's greatest warriors?

And if we're gonna do the whole tinfoil hat thing, who's to say that a Tenno hasn't already figured this out? Perhaps he ditched the Lotus while he still had the will to do so. Perhaps he Stalks us even now, professing his individuality in a frame of his own making.

Just something to think about.

STREAM SHOULD GO LIVE TONIGHT AROUND 9:30 EST!  CLICK HERE FOR TWITCH LINK~~](http://www.twitch.tv/warframeferret)

WILL POST NEW EVENT, glad to know there's interest, can probably do this again properly by the weekend.

My clan went into Pallus to do some mat-farming last night, and essentially accidentally made it to wave 60.  We're regrouping and reforming after this surprising development, and expect our next run to be to wave 100.  The only reason we had to stop at 60 last night was because we weren't prepared, with a lot of sub-optimal weapons, insufficient ammo boxes of the correct types, and two Warframes with almost zero utility for this goal (We brought a Frost and Saryn to level them up lol)

We'd likely be running Pluto-Pallus, with a group composed of Nova, Vauban, Banshee, ~~Mag~~ Trinity [UPDATE:  Wraith.exe and Redditors have pointed out that Mag Pull will be late-game suicide as he yanks Toxics to his own feet for instant death].  We'll be running 4x6 Energy Siphons, 4x Despair, and 2 Ogris.

I'm not frothing at the mouth to stream, and actually don't even have an account set up, but I have a computer and internet connection that would handle the process casually, and I was curious just how much interest this would generate among you guys.

EDIT:  Setting up a Twitch and Onlive accounts now to test which will run the smoothest, and it looks like this will be happening.  Tentative schedule of starting at 9:30 EST tonight, July 24th.

**TL:DR** at the bottom but I do hope you read it all

Im going to cut this short. But first I want to say that this is **NOT** a wtichhunt. I have no hard feelings towards the guy I am about to point out but I do think that this needs to be addressed.

---
###Story

So I joined a defense mission for one of the new artifacts. Unlucky(?) for me it was **20 waves** of corpus. I thought to myself let's make the best out of it.

* Host did not lag

* We had a decent team: Ember, Trinity, Volt, Rhino

* And everyone seems to talk english

When we got to **wave 16** the Volt asks if it's ok he go AFK for **2-3min**. As everyone in the team was in a generly happy mode and it still wasen't the ""hard"" waves we said ok.

---
###Problem 

We are now on **Wave 5** and the guy is **STILL** afk. and it's now we started to reflect on it

As I said I am not mad at the guy mostely irretated but *no hate towards him* as I don't know what might have happend to him IRL, Explosive diareé, Hospital call, He fainted I don't know but the problem still exsists.

But as there is nothing we can do we just keep playing. Now on **Wave 2** we all die due to simply getting overrunned and the mission failed.


And in the end I did not get the artifact becuase there was no more time to find a groop :(

---
###Proof

""[Pictures of what I got](http://imgur.com/a/N3Ht2#5AGg7S4)""

Picture explenation:

 * Picture 1: We start to reflect over that he is AFK on wave 5

 * Picture 2: Showing Chat box.

 * Picture 3: 3 waves after I started to ""document"" it he is still AFK

 * Picture 4: Everyone but the AFKer dies on Wave 2 out of 20, You can still see him AFK on the map

 * Picture 5: Proof that he was AFK - Kills

 * Picture 6: Proof that he was AFK - Items

 * Picture 7: Proof that I did not have time to find a new groop, (Self pity)

1373691628.0,42,self.Warframe,1i7bm0,The Ultimate Orokin Tower Guide Part II,44,2,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1i7bm0/the_ultimate_orokin_tower_guide_part_ii/,"Hey all! Update 9 is finally here, and with it comes new Void Maps!

I went out and bought a butt load of keys to try and get a feel for the new maps and see if there are any new secrets or otherwise important features!


First, the new missions.

**CAPTURE:** In this mission you have to capture the same poor Corpus bastard who has been suffering since he was added. This mission runs on the same seed as the older maps (albeit with new rooms added) so no special layouts.


**MOBILE DEFENSE:** Already we start off different in [this](http://i.imgur.com/jN5M7xd.jpg) room. Then, we make our way with the payload through a series of rooms that are both different and familiar. Eventually you will reach [this](http://i.imgur.com/qS3l8Ap.jpg) room (which appears in most seeds) and you do what ya gotta do. And that's it. No final stand against a ton of enemies or anything like that. This mobile defense is much more comparable to the Corpus mobile defense missions.

The major difference of this mission is the run room. HO-LEE-CRAP the run room. You must first begin running the familiar path, but instead of jumping over some lasers, this time you must jump DOWN a huge tunnel of lasers as seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/ePNcedp.jpg). Once you've made it past that you jump up a large jet stream and then are shot into the air where you must fall down more lasers as seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/jyI0zzl.jpg). Then, a quick jump over some ice pads to the end of the room and the treasures are yours! The escape route is slightly different as well. An additional room seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/XV8SkzT.jpg). 

NOTE: I am not sure if this new run is exclusive to mobile defense.


**DEFENSE:** In this mission you have to defend a very poorly protected crypod from some very hard hitting enemies for a set number of waves. You are placed in a [large room](http://i.imgur.com/Nrds2Qe.jpg) with a lower and upper floor. Laser panels surround the defense pod and can be activated with [these switches](http://i.imgur.com/msiXQ9F.jpg) but have a 30 second cooldown before they can be used again. All they do is make one small sweep from the panel across and back before they shut down. They do a lot of damage and can thin the herd if you're being swarmed. As for secrets, there aren't any I could see. There are a bunch of monster closets scattered around and a few containers placed as well.

Word of advice, be well prepared for defense. Bring friends, best gear, etc. Even Defense I can be a bit of a challenge because of how much damage the enemies do.


**MISC:**

I noticed that a new music plays when doing the puzzle runs. May have been coincidence.


**NEW ROOMS:**

In [this](http://i.imgur.com/yqsPpr9.jpg) room, behind this waterfall is a small hole. Jumping into leads to a small treasure room with a few lockers.

[This room](http://i.imgur.com/uAEa8Cb.jpg), while large and ornate, contains only one small secret. Following the water tunnels below leads to a small treasure room. 

[This](http://i.imgur.com/qeBK347.jpg) room contains extremely deadly laser floors (I lost three respawns in one) but has some containers atop the planters.

/u/Citizen_V found a room hidden behind an elevator. Their guide info is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1i7bm0/the_ultimate_orokin_tower_guide_part_ii/cb2v8d0)

/u/dragnic found [this room](http://i.imgur.com/4imUD5B.jpg). On the right side of the room is [a hole](http://i.imgur.com/GCxuAjK.jpg) partway up the wall, that if reached, leads to a small portion of loot.

/u/ad0rable pointed out that in the large hallway room with a lower section surrounded by a pathway leading to doors going outwards, the pressure plate in the center of the lower section will open two large orbs suspended above. Inside those orbs are some containers that you will have a few seconds to open for some loot! I'll grab a screenshot of this room as soon as I can.

/u/ad0rable also found that in the large 4-way room with an open air ceiling that climbing on the pillar in the center of the room will allow you to access some hidden crates behind grates on each of the 4 surrounding pillars. His images and explanation are [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1i7bm0/the_ultimate_orokin_tower_guide_part_ii/cb2wph5)

/u/comitatus says:""There's one room which is a figure 8 looking room. Atop the middle area with two red doors is an elevator; you get on top by wall running up and hitting the switch to drop down into it. Contains mild loot, four lockers and up to four containers."" /u/fujutsuki provided a screenshot of [the room](http://i.imgur.com/gwCua9w.jpg) and also [the top](http://i.imgur.com/Xq6Ulu1.jpg).

A few rooms have new looks, but are the same in functionality.


As always, if you find anything I missed or have better screenshots, please post them! I'll add them in.

I have added in some more statistics since my post last week, and I will continue to add in calculation for different statistics as I think of more stuff to look at.  

	Sample size: 256 alerts
	Sample duration: 163 hours
	On average, an alert starts every 38.39 minutes

	Average alerts active at once: 1.90
	Max alerts active at once: 6

	Planet occurance:
	Ceres: 10.55%
	Earth: 4.69%

	Pluto: 4.69%
	Saturn: 13.28%
	Sedna: 8.59%
	Uranus: 10.55%
	Venus: 5.08%

	Average credit duration: 49.12
	Average artifact duration: 48.81
	Average ultra-rare (potato/Forma) duration: 100.25
	Average other alert duration: 52.78
	Average overall alert duration: 50.14

	Sample set: 208 credit-only alerts and 48 reward alerts
	Average credits-only value: 3941
	Average reward alert value: 4070
	Average overall alert value: 3966

	Percentage credits-only: 81.25%

	Ash Helmet (Blueprint): 1, 2.08%
	Brokk Hammer (Blueprint): 1, 2.08%
	Enemy Radar (Artifact): 3, 6.25%
	Energy Siphon (Artifact): 3, 6.25%
	Forma (Blueprint): 2, 4.17%
	Frost Helmet (Blueprint): 1, 2.08%
	Glaive (Blueprint): 1, 2.08%
	Heat Dagger (Blueprint): 1, 2.08%
	Heat Sword (Blueprint): 1, 2.08%
	Jaw Sword (Blueprint): 1, 2.08%
	Loki Helmet (Blueprint): 1, 2.08%
	Nyx Helmet (Blueprint): 2, 4.17%
	Orokin Catalyst (Blueprint): 1, 2.08%
	Orokin Reactor (Blueprint): 1, 2.08%
	Physique (Artifact): 3, 6.25%

	Steel Charge (Artifact): 2, 4.17%
	Vauban Chassis (Blueprint): 2, 4.17%
	Vauban Helmet (Blueprint): 1, 2.08%
	Vauban Systems (Blueprint): 1, 2.08%
	Volt Helmet (Blueprint): 1, 2.08%

To go along with the percentage of alerts showing up on a planet, here is the percentage of total missions on each planet.

	Ceres: 9.13%
	Earth: 5.02%
	Eris: 11.87%
	Europa: 8.22%
	Jupiter: 5.48%
	Mars: 7.76%
	Mercury: 3.20%
	Neptune: 5.94%
	Pluto: 5.94%
	Saturn: 9.59%
	Sedna: 11.87%
	Uranus: 10.50%
	Venus: 5.48%

An interesting thing to note is that some planets have more alerts than their percentage of missions might suggest.  Meaning that unlocking those planets completely will, statistically, give you more alerts per mission unlocked (Saturn being the most significant).  I'm not positive if this data is conclusive or if the RNG just favored those planets heavily this week.  Next week I'll have more data to see if the trend is still there.

Another thing to note is that the average time for the non-ultra-rare alerts is all effectively the same.  So, I'll be rolling those catagories down into ultra-rare, other, and overall.  At this point, I do not believe the Vauban BPs are in the ultra-rare group. Of the four Vauban alerts this week, there was a 50m, two ~60m, and one 1.5h.  Compared to all 1.5h ish for the Forma/potatos.  

I will also post the 4/22 - 6/28 data provided by /u/PlasmaSheep in a post below, for comparison to the new alert stats. 

The first thing to notice is the alert interval.  It is up from 30 min to ~38 min.  This means that alerts are ~25-30% less common than they were before the Alerts 2.0 system came out.  However, the average duration went up from 37 min to 50 min, so alerts are lasting about 35% longer than they were.  Also, note that the percentage of credit-only alerts has dropped.  It has gone from 85% credit only to just over 81%, meaning that the ratio of reward alerts has gone up by ~25%.  

So, we're getting fewer alerts overall, but they're lasting longer and there is a higher ratio of reward alerts.  So we're getting the same number of reward alerts per time period, just fewer credit-only alerts.  

Another thing to note is the credit value of alerts.  On average, the credit value for alerts has gone up ~800 credits, or about 25%.  Combined with the increased alert interval, that means that there are approximately the same number of credits per time unit being offered through alerts, but with more reward per alert.  

Also, I have included statistics on concurrent alerts.  Apparently, there was a point at which there were 6 alerts active at once, and two instances where there were five active at once.  But the average number is approximately two alerts going at any given time, something which most of us could have guessed, but it's nice to have hard numbers.  

Credit for me including seperate data for ultra-rare alerts goes to /u/Absolutionis for pointing that out to me.  Credit to /u/Vapad for asking about data on the number of alerts active at once and getting me to write that method into my code.  

One thing I'm considering is posting my code and the json file containing the data.  Is that something people would be interested in seeing?  

I *think* that's most of what there is to talk about.  If anyone has any other stats you think I should track, or any questions about the data, feel free to speak up.

I got great feedback from all the viewers and the people that submitted ideas / suggestions for what they would like to see for the game interface updates / changes. Below I'll post the images and give a little breakdown of what is going on, just as a sort of... recap.

_____________________________________________________________________

**MAIN MENU**

Alright so we'll start off with the main screen. The goal for this was to make sure that the UI didn't take you out of the galaxy map, you always had access to the mission map, alerts, and messages always visible in some way, shape, or form.

http://i.imgur.com/6OkNGKa.jpg

To accomplish this I made the menus pull up and down by simply clicking on tabs that make them slid up or down accordingly.

http://i.imgur.com/S7ZIpqR.jpg

the chat also slides out from the social panel so it's not always intrusive, it could also be moved around possible like the current version.

http://i.imgur.com/FFC2fQq.jpg

_____________________________________________________________________

**FOUNDRY**

Next up is the foundry screen. Not much needs changed here, but I would love to see tabs for the different types of blueprints, this would make it easier to see what's cooking, or what you have ready to go for each different slot as they're ready. Also, having an inventory button on the screen is REALLY important to me. As of right now, you have to hit back, click arsenal, click inventory, and go from there; simply putting the button on this screen would get rid of that and streamline the workflow.

http://i.imgur.com/TM0HnGZ.jpg

_____________________________________________________________________

**LOADOUT**

The goal here was to make it easier to see what mods you have in each weapon respectively.

On the left you'll see you have your Warframe name with DETAILED information about it, with stats for those of us that love crunching numbers. As well as each equipped item, with sentinel, weapon, secondary, and melee. each showing if its ""potato'd"" or not, as well as level.

On the right, you'll see that there are boxes that correspond to the mod slots available on each weapon. clicking on the mod section for an equipped item will take you to that mod screen.

You also will have an Inventory Button and Mod Button, to take you to those screens quickly if needed.

Lastly in the top left you'll see the preset button, this is where you would be able to save up to 5? (or however many you would like) Weapon and mod sets for your warframes. No more swapping out mods over and over, just a few clicks and you're off and running.

http://i.imgur.com/KlHirfA.jpg

_____________________________________________________________________

**MOD SCREEN**

As the mod screen currently stands, it has a number list at the bottom, and also always shows duplicate mods.

To fix this I decided to use an ""accordian"" style system for the mods. You can see how many variations of 1 type of mod you have in the bottom corner of the card, and when you click on the mod it expands to show the contained variations. Also, SCROLL BAR.

http://i.imgur.com/cNz0pjk.jpg

_____________________________________________________________________

**MISSION SELECT**

It would be AWESOME if you could see the points sitting on a larger more detailed planet. If its on a space station, just have the space station actually shown orbiting the planet. Also, showing a list of the available missions with details of if it has a Boss encounter as well as what the prerequisite to unlocking it is.

http://i.imgur.com/H6ptRYS.jpg

_____________________________________________________________________

**COMBAT UI**

For the combat UI, it was VERY important to me, to not have to look away from combat to see my information about my character as well as teammates. My vision should, as much as possible, be locked to my reticle.

With that said I used a design based on the ARC HUD UI mod from World of Warcraft. Which I ALWAYS loved and thought more games could use.

Your shield, hp, mp, sentinel shield/hp, target hp, and four skill boxes below. Below that 3 bars or 4 bars indicating your teammates health, Always on screen for people playing trinity or just wanting to see who needs help.

Also, a transparent, larger minimap shown on the opposing side of the character. If you swap viewpoints, the map and everything move to the respective locations.

Lastly, stacking pickup information, just being able to see exactly what you picked up would be GREAT. :D

http://i.imgur.com/ZGfu4bc.jpg

Swapped sides

http://i.imgur.com/ZHqoeee.jpg

_____________________________________________________________________

**GAME END SCREEN**

All that needs to be shown here is more information about what was picked up. Include RES in the screen, I want to know how much Rubedo I picked up from my Kappa run etc. 

Below that, do away with the timer that automatically moves you on. Replace it with an end mission or evacuate button, as well as a RETRY or REDEPLOY option. Allowing people that want to restart the mission to choose this option and restart, or instantly requeue for the mission they just finished.

THATS IT!

     This idea was born from my craving for more corpse mutilation on melee kills, as even weapons as wicked as scythes in this game usually just swat enemies away or only cut off the weapon arm of the humanoid enemies. 
    I imagine it as the first heavy throwing weapon AND the first weapon (edit:err, melee weapon) to have a holdable charge; your frame would just keep it spinning on one arm while it's held and charged (and it would look and sound damn fierce). Once released it would fly quickly in the direction you were aiming, but unlike the glaive or kestrel, it would cut strait through a number of enemies w/o being deflected.

Sorry, humor/drawings/funny screencaps are generally a better source of frontpage content, but I wish (with importance) to discuss this new Grineer enemy in Update 8, the scorpion, this incredibly Mortal Combat-clichée  ""GET OVER HERE"" character wielding a machete.


Where to start? What worries me is how rushed in development this enemy is. [I took a screen capture at brief moment I was grabbed, it's safe to assume that this is approximately the range distance to which the bullshit emerges.] (http://i.imgur.com/LDAbJ1L.jpg)


I read a topic regarding how player-stunning abilites are BS yesterday. I understand why people have concerns with this, I don't think this is the problem; it's a problem when YOU CAN'T AVOID IT. We, as players are generally being stun in any games ever as a result of *not-paying-attention*. Depending on how difficult the stun was pulled off, the DURATION of said stun effect generally is based around this one idea. The Scorpion's action does not have any type of restrictions if not for RANGE. I have had several occasions where this enemy would pull me through cover-type props (like crates and barrels) that would normally occlude any type of explosion or projectiles.

__________________


**The Scorpion doesn't give a fuck.** It will grab you without a visual hint or clue that it is about to and the only way to avoid it is to stay out of it's range, which is to say the least about the size of the average room in the game.. Let's compare it to the MOST IRRITATING enemies in the game so far for my point's sake:

**Disruptors:** *Takes away all of target Shield/Energy using a melee-type projectile.*
**Can be Avoided?:** *Yes. The projectile must hit the player, and is very range limited; will only be fired from up close. Not to mention Cryo ammo/blades.*

**Shockwave MOA:** *Slowly animates a stomp action that will create a red circle that is scale-progressive and knock down target on collision*
**Can be Avoided?:** *Yes, jump over said circle.*

**Rollers:** *Spiky balls generating sufficient noise for the target's self-awareness. Will BRIEFLY stun player on impact, mostly irritating in tight combat situations.*
**Can be Avoided?:** *with a good hearing sense, paying attention to the field AND a well placed shot, yes, absolutely.*

**Scoprion?:** *Grabs the player in a long range fashion, removing the player's input for ~3 seconds. All enemies targeting the player meantime.*
**Can be Avoided?:** *Yes, only if YOU STAY 30 METERS BACK!*

1368890103.0,39,self.Warframe,1ekuxd,The Rhino dilemma,56,17,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1ekuxd/the_rhino_dilemma/,"The Rhino nerf on Friday certainly hit the frame's overall role very hard; I wanted to start a serious discussion about this here (and move it to the forums later). 

In case anyone missed it, 
&gt; Rhino Skin no longer grants full invincibility, but can now reach up to 80% Damage Reduction at highest Mod level.

Now what was the thought process that led up to this nerf? What was DE thinking?!?!?! /sarcasm. I think a good long look needs to be taken at Rhino's role in a game.


**ROLE OF RHINO**

* Obviously a tank, but what kind? Frost is a ""battlemage"", a caster type. What really separates him from Rhino? They both have the same stats; 150 initial shield, 150 armor, 100 power, 100 health. The wiki says Frost is designed more for damage and casting while Rhino's abilities are based on cc and stuns, but the obvious answer here is Iron Skin. 

* Rhino is made for frontline combat, an initiator. While other frames (frost for example) strive to survive long enough in a fight to make an impact with their weapons or abilities, Rhino had the ability to wade into combat and go crazy. He could go toe-to-toe with disruptors, toxic ancients, you name it. Enemies you had to make sure to keep a distance from with other frames. *THIS WAS WHAT MADE RHINO SPECIAL*. This was what made him so satisfying to play. A tank that had no competition when it came to the ""true"" definition of tanking.

**THE PROBLEMS**

* Iron skin, his iconic ability was the largest source of the problem. Though initially a third of his 150 energy pool, the 50 energy cost of iron skin soon became nothing with continuity, streamline, and flow (which rhino players stacked.) Shield mods were prioritized over armor and health (""a good rhino player should be taking negligible health damage"") and many rhinos could go over a minute of invincibility. 

* Many people only used iron skin, and nothing else. Rhino charge became a utility spell for catching up with pesky rushers, rhino stomp found a small niche in defense missions and in the trinity energy vampire combo. Radial blast was, on the most part, ignored, due to its pitiful damage (compared to other frames aoe spells) and high energy cost. Heck, I haven't used radial blast once; I don't even know what the effects look like. 

* With Iron Skin, there became a change in focus from ""surviving"" to ""dealing enough damage to compensate for invincibility."" Sounds strange, but bear with me. If a rhino is swinging away at level 50 ancients with a scindo, all he needs to worry about it killing them before they lose interest and go for his teammates or the pod. Which ends up being spamming charge attacks. While being in ""god mode"" is fun, it was boring and repetitive and decreased my overall skill as a warframe player, a fact i noticed when I got a brand new Loki and started leveling him. It also lets rhino players go into their own little ""world,"" not minding others and swinging/shooting away. 

**EFFECTS OF THE NERF**

* Apparently Rhino should still have full cc immunity, which is excellent. His protection against 1) Disruptor drains, 2) knockback/downs (rollers and shockwaves) and 3) poison clouds was the best utility that iron skin gave, it was what separated him from others. 

* He no longer regenerates shields for the duration, since he is now taking damage. This, I feel, is two nerfs in one. Now rhino players are encouraged to use iron skin as they initiate as opposed to when their shields are down, and retreat when their health starts falling as that cannot be regen'd. In fact it ~~encourages~~ forces the use of iron skin even further. If DE planned to encourage the usage of his other abilities or just weaken him in general, they hit him in the wrong areas. 

**TLDR: In my humble opinion, Iron Skin was overpowered. However, the utility of invincibility and cc immunity it gave to Rhino was what made him so special and stand out. By all means a nerf was needed, but hit him at the wrong angle. Iron Skin is simultaneously Rhino's most broken and most iconic/rewarding focal point, and there are ways to fix the first part and preserve the latter WHILE promoting teamplay, cooperation, and synergy. (see below)**



**A BRAINSTORMED IDEA/SUGGESTION**

Make Iron Skin his 3rd ability, get rid of radial blast. Iron Skin now costs 75 to 100 energy to cast. His 2nd ability is a 10 energy taunt, that encourages enemies to attack rhino.

* This fixes the problem with Iron Skin being too spammable. Only the rhino's with the best mods will be able to use Iron Skin repeatedly (although I'm a fan of keeping it 75 just so new people and those that are unlucky with rng drops (flow, continuity, streamline) can still use it), people will have to think more about using it instead of throwing on iron skin whenever they see an enemy. ""Is it worth blowing Iron Skin right now?"" ""Can I make enough of an impact by going invincible?"" These are the thoughts a rhino player should be thinking, and increasing the cost of the ability is a step in the right direction. 

* The taunt is, in my opinion, a large improvement to the role of rhino, the balance of iron skin, synergy and teamwork. The role of rhino is to tank. Not in the durable-caster way of Saryn and frost, but to be in the thick of things. Taunt takes pressure off his teammates and lets him utilize his above average stats/IRON SKIN for his teammates. It ALSO adds a different dynamic on Rhino. Now it'll be much more difficult to kill all these enemies in the 15 seconds that Iron Skin gives him, as there are more enemies of varying distances from him. And since Iron Skin is a costly ability, he cannot spam it. When Iron Skin runs out he will be relying on his stats. So if he communicates with his team, they will take advantage of the taunt and use their aoe or firepower for a ""combo"" so to speak. 

Synergy and teamwork is what really, really needs to be encouraged, and I hope this idea makes sense to some of you (I tend to be bad at explaining). Synergy and teamwork is immensely satisfying to pull off, and will add to the longevity of the game. Hell, I've even friended people after a game of good combo's and kept playing with them. 

EDIT: some formatting

EDITEDIT: I've played/play a lot of dota and dota2, and one of the things that really excited me about warframe was the same format of abilities; 3 ""spells"" and an ""ulti"". Added a brand new dynamic to a shooter. Now dota has been around for a while, and what I realized with how IceFrog (the ""caretaker"" of dota right now so to speak) balanced the 100 ish heroes in the game without directly nerfing was to either utilize:

* **power creeping** - which is when he makes many other heroes slightly stronger instead of nerfing one hero
* **reworking** - when he wants to ""beta"" the hero's role by changing it a little, and seeing what players come up with. 

Nerfing makes people unhappy, which is life. But these ARE viable options to explore. Sometimes a nerf is necessary and DE is far more capable of seeing when that is compared to me, but I hope they will consider these points.

* 15% of XP earned on Maxed Warframes and Weapons goes to Storage.
* XP from storage can be applied to other Weapons and Warframes.
* Maximum Amount of XP that can be applied to a weapon from storage = the XP to go from 1 -20.(This ensures the player does need to do some of the leveling normally but the weapon should be semi viable by 20.)
* Login Reward XP goes to Storage instead of to a specific Slot.

Why is this needed?

Currently, most of us are bringing at least 1 item that is useless in matches this makes the situations harder than they need to be and can result in forcing some players to carry others when they bring too few fully leveled items to be effective.

Second, content that is easy enough to bring bad weapons the XP payout to your lower level weapons is lower the more kills you get if you aren't getting kills with that weapon. This strongly impacts frames that are offensive. My Ember on Infested Missions will frequently break 500 kills even while other frames are doing theirs jobs because Ember is very good at killing the light infested. But, because most of my kills are from World on Fire I get the least weapon xp of anyone in the group.

Finally, Solo players level up certain items incredibly slowly as unless you are heavily focused on using a weapon natural usage of a weapon you are leveling is quite low. Most Matches I get Warframe XP, Secondary XP, and a very small amount of Melee XP.  So, solo players mastery goes up much more slowly because to level items they actually have to use them.

While this alteration does not truly solve any of the above problems it mitigates most of them at least partially without breaking anything at least that I am aware of.

Why?

The Void's return at the present is too low if you already have credits and only want one or two Void Items. Adding Tokens makes the return higher and allows for creating a potential loot that can appeal to everyone.

The reason for the new forma/potato change items is that DE has made a sufficient number of changes and new additions that mistakes with builds are becoming less the players fault. One could not be expected to anticipate DE adding 14 mod points to each frame via artifact or providing direct upgrade Prime's.",,False,self,t5_2urg0,False,,,True,t3_1ird9l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1ird9l/suggestionsxp_storagevoid_tokens/,

Just ran Xini as my First Win of the Day, had Stalker drop a Hate BP, and nabbed an Exterminate II key from it. Finished the mission, eagerly check my foundry and... nothing. No BP, no key, no mods. My frame's level was back where it was before the mission had started.   


I haven't had this issue with any other missions I ran before this one. The only difference is that First Win of the Day happened.   


Checked the forums, it seems that other are having this issue as well. Hopefully it'll get fixed sooner rather than later.   


TL;DR Make sure the mission you get the First Win of the Day bonus on isn't something you care about, you may not receive rewards for it.  

**EDIT:** It's looking like the bug might affect everyone in the group. So if one person has First Win of the Day, no one gets rewards. 


UNIMPORTANT EDIT: Interestingly enough, directly after the failed Xini run, I did Themisto, then Xini again. Stalker showed up targeting me (as it had done the first time), yapping about how I will pay for killing Golem (it had been Phorid the first time). He dropped a Dread BP.

Now that we've all gotten a taste of what ridiculously high drop rates for rare mats, I think holding an event like this one weekend a month would be a really good idea. It would be a really good incentive to log in, and no one loses out. Players who left because they didn't like farming can come back, and everyone's happy, and happy players = more money for DE (more inclination to spend on plat). Of course, the drop rates won't be as high.

Edit: It's been pointed out to me that this would be bad for the game, considering its heavy emphasis on farming. Perhaps they could increase the number of mats dropped like they did with Control Modules (instead of one Neurode, two instead), while keeping the drop rate the same?

__________________________________________

warframe

grineer pa system: When a grineer presses the pannel a pre-recorded intercom blazes across the ship saying ""they're here""


grineeer broken telephone: ""they're here"" that's how the ship is alerted and strings of enemies come.  The ones that stay behind are the ones that got the message wrong (telephone broke)


endless defence: you are actually killing scouting parties that are sent after each other to see what happened to the previous scouting party


All female warframes should be voiced by DE rebecca, all male ones should be voiced by the guy who does the grineer voices


**suggestion:** ff 12 sentinel system


**suggestion:** always have the option to cycle through abilities (in air, casting, etc), ability to type into chat always (i.e. banshee's ultimate you can't do either so it's 7 seconds of waiting)


**fix:** chat and health bars should not overlaping


**fix:** opening chests should not stop reloading


**antimatter: ultra:** disperse into nanomachines/antimatter particles and engulf everything ( kind of like disintegration of capture target, but black)


**antimatter: ultra:** giant pulse cannon morphed from arms (we have no ultra where a giant forward beam is made, also give it slight aim adjustments?)


**antimatter:** orca/whale sound with deep bass when ultimate is cast


**antimatter:** gimp arm disintegrates along with the body and leaving through that arm hole, engulfs nearby 
 enemies while armour kneels as a empty husk, particles repopulates armuor when attack is done


**suggestion:** voice acting for warframes, even if just movement grunts


~~**fix:** game thinks you are airborne, next slash attack is a ground attack aoe.  Prevents spell casting.~~ fixed 8.2


**volt suggestion:** aoe would unlock doors, cancel alarms etc


Lotus reroutes ships to cloning facilities, or we steal the ships and the grineers would buy them back


**suggestion:** synergize ultimates, overlapping ultimates cause a different affect e.g.: Banshee ult would fan out embers flames further


**suggestion:** tally of resources gained at end of mission


**Suggestion:** allow experience gain with forma polarization


**Suggestion:** experience gain from finishing a crafting item


**Suggestion:** portraits for gaining mastery ranks


**suggestion:** A cancel button, a cancel button for everything


**suggestion:** dread bow dismemberment should also pin dismembered piece allowing for penetration kills, e.g. dread dismembers an arm, which goes flying and hits the person behind it.  Currently the dread bow just dismembers and the body will not fly and hit others.


**suggestion:** mission mixups, not just ""Hey tennno we have an issue :P"" but have a laser shoot the shuttle pod 
causing it to crash into the space rock and be flanked my 10 grineers as you crawl out with no shields and half health.  It sounds unfair, but boost the rewards as well.

- Or have bosses do actual cool stuff.  Currently: ""General vor has unfathomable powers!"" He teleports sometimes, which is quite boring. Instead, make boss battle more memorable.  Grapples, finisher moves, exclusive arenas, LARGER bosses. Bad ideas, but boss fights are pretty plain at the moment.  Jackal is the best so far, also the one boss that drops frost pieces.

- could also mix in those random mixups into boss fights.


**suggestion:** air dash/ redirection


**suggestion:** slower rise during entrance of solo missions


**suggestion:** sentinel commands on the fly, like on/off option for stealth reasons


**want:** proper community tabs: global clans, ~~recruitment ads, clan banner messages~~ Implemented 8.3, etc


**suggestion:** individual warframe traits: banshee fires bow weapons with faster velocity, ember fireresistance/moves faster on fire, rhino 50% less stagger, etc
.  Something unique from the base stats, like how rhino has more armor, or banshee has more power.


**suggestion:** saved mod loadouts, strip mod button, show mod true cost when being dragged, drag outside of the box to de-equip, Better way to view mods(more vertical rows), more noticeable differences based on mod level (color, glow, shiny?)


**suggestion:** status/attribute page with mod effects(on off) in main menu/arsenal


**fix:** banshees [butt pixel](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1h62p1/my_warframe_notepad/)


**suggestion:** sentinel husk when dead, evaporates like a corpse or molecularizes like a capture unit


**suggestion:** stomp dodger mini-game


**suggestion:** sentinel health bar


**suggestion:** objective waypoints appear at the end point of the room itself and not just on the mini-map.


**suggestion:** green shroud, or something, to dictate blessing of life invincibility duration.

_______________________________________________________________________________________

new stuff


**suggestion:** don't have a roll after jumping off small ledges, as well as rolls after in-air actions. Thanks SoSpecial edit: this seems to be working better than before, suggestion needs revision (lolwut)


**sugggestion:** different colour waypoints.  Player spotting waypoint, next location/objective waypoint, route to get to destination markers(only this one exists on the map, but I would like physically present markers on the field much like player spots)


**suggestion:** Popup message for demotion or promotions in clan.


**suggestion:** full rotation when down, possibly better crawling when down


**suggestion**:  distance for actual objectives


**Suggestion:** After 8.3, the Mission map UI is way too condensed, in my opinion.  It did not need changing.


**Suggestion:** Show the enemy level range while hovering the mouse over the planet.


**Want: **tenno base hub, much like a dojo but more grandeur and allows public access.  Not enough community interaction in this game!


**fun:** when the escape pod leaves it creates a vacuum in space and sucks a few enemies and items out


**suggestion:** vacuums should space some enemies (warframes have magnetic boots and are invulnerable until they jump, then they get a spaced animation and die?)

**Fix:** running out of secondary ammo while holding data masses will make you drop the mass and switch weapons.  If someone is unaware of this, it could hinder mission time.

**Suggestion**: A favorite or lock button for mods so you couldn't sell or use as fusion fuel.  Would also have a favorites list so you can pull up your favorite (beefed up) mods quickly for allotment.

- Pistol Ammo +20
- Rifle Ammo +20
- Shotgun Ammo +10
- Sniper Ammo +10

In some cases this is fine, like with the Lex or Hek, but I've got a Gorgon with +60% fire rate, and even with +30% mag capacity and +30% max ammo, it runs out incredibly quick, especially fighting level 30+ enemies, and with the 20 rifle ammo drops, once it's out it's pretty much out for the rest of the mission.

So my idea is that rather than dropping a set number of ammo per pack, it drops a percentage of your gun's total ammo. So rifle ammo would instead drop, maybe 7% max ammo per drop, which for my Gorgon would be roughly 49 bullets per ammo pack (7% of 700 bullets total). And each gun would have a differing percentage based on their total ammo.

The novelty of having something unexpected happen during a mission wears off quickly, and all that's left is the constant fret of worrying whether or not your mission will throw a second task at you after completing the first.

I can understand what DE is trying to do with the underlying idea, in that it provides some variety to an otherwise monotonous run, but trying to supplement monotony with another dosage of unrewarding monotony doesn't do anything to benefit a player's enjoyment of the game. (I won't even go into missions that turn into elimination missions that fail to spawn the last enemy, but those are annoying too.)

With the way extended missions are set up, I doubt there are many players that look forward to the game extending their time on a map. There's no reward, and the dynamic changing mission system has potential to ruin a player's performance and progress.

I believe this system could be improved by simply giving players the feeling that their time was worth the investment. Rather than simply providing more enemies to kill, I feel that extending a mission with secondary missions should increase the end-of-level bonus credits awarded, as well as provide an additional reward.

There's currently nothing, but I hope that changes soon.  Warframe is really starting to take off - having to make multiple subreddits for it was inevitable.

Hello, fellow Tenno!

Operative reporting in with a vital piece of intelligence about our vicious adversary - The Grineer Empire. No longer will their hidden messages puzzle our agents in the field for I have deciphered their alphabet!

So, the Devs hinted in the last livestream that they have left clues in some of the released artwork which could help decipher in-game languages. I've checked around a bit and voila! - the Grineer faction image from Fansite Kit features a caption in their language, unimaginatively reading ""grineer"".

http://i.imgur.com/zj0j9cX.jpg

Using this image as a key I was able to decipher most of the grineer alphabet. ""Decipher"" is a rather strong word, really. Each letter of the grineer alphabet simply corresponds to a letter of English one and grineer basically speak and write English. I have compiled what I uncovered in the following image for your convenience. Note that b j k q x and z are not present, as I haven't come across a text featuring them.

http://i.imgur.com/kebeXE1.jpg

EDIT: fixed an incorrect ""D"". Thanks JudgeN for pointing it out!

A couple of signs from Grineer Asteroid Outpost biome, which I used to decipher the letters after the five first ones.

http://i.imgur.com/BTjnWEt.jpg

This one reads ""Supremacy is duty"".

http://i.imgur.com/UQOVlRV.jpg

And this one reads ""If our enemies deserved peace - they would have defeated us"".

So, there you have it! Go now and uncover the secrets that grineer marines have scribbled on the walls of the bathrooms!

----

* **THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM**: How to deal with burnout? Enemy types, planets, weapons not working anymore, more talking to community. However, new players are alienated and they'd like to address that as well. DAMAGE SYSTEM OVERHAUL (Steve: ""big changes to how elemental, physical, armor piercing damage is handled"") ""The gameplay isn't boring; playing after 500 hours is boring.""
* Loadout presets may be coming!
* New scoring system for solo (personal bests) and team (best time/score)
* Achievement system? Can be integrated with Steam if running through Steam, but not required if running the client by itself.
* To Tier Weapons or make them all viable? 
* Less ambiguity on failstates vs. winstates for future events: the Time Limit is the Deadline, but the Completion/Win State is 100%
* Potentially less grindy events in the future!
* Dual stat mods going into Nightmare
* Fan art! DE loves it!
* NEW LEVEL SET: Not only the derelict Void, but also... New Corpus Sets (post-Update 10)
* More cinematics: a new Corpus Villain in the works (Early October aimed released) (ALAD V?)
* Update 10 coming at around September.
* DUAL VASTOS coming!
* OPTIONAL NIGHTMARE MODE is being discussed! Also, difficulty problems being addressed.

------------------

User questions!

1. **What's the goal with Update 10, and is there a name?** Still working on it! We name them as we get them completed. Infested Void map

2. **Progress report on the new Golem?** Nothing... except massive VIDEOS AND STUFF! Images linked as soon as we're able! Two phase boss!

3. WARFRAME REVEAL: NECROMANCER! [See here for screenshot](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1kd5bl/necro_warframe_confirmed_in_livestream_12/)

4. **More Movement Skills/Potential?** Still working on balancing; would certain skills invalidate abilities? ""Nono jetpacks."" Maybe not jetbacks, but something more ninja!

5. **Reputation system leak?** At the end of a match, you can boost another players' repuation system. Basically, player ratings based on other players. There will be balances in check (no ""bump me bro!"") Synergy bonuses for those who have commended each other! ""It may be a horrible idea but we're trying it out!""

6. **Will there be more wicked reload animations?** Definitely! More reloads in the last patch, more on the way in the future!

7. **Any comments on the idles?** ""We kind of forced them onto people, and we got mixed responses."" Idles may be options instead of forced: THREE IDLES PER WARFRAME!

8. **Will the netcode be changed to not be peer-to-peer?** The door's always open to that, but we're still threading and optimizing the code to make it better. Users should be able to see what their connections are, and overall improvements are coming! Exploring options to fix Strict NAT problems.

9. **More wildlife?** Yes!!! More creatures in the works.

10. **Nova's Season 2 Helmet?** Incoming!

11. **Fix armor for endgame?** Because we're bringing loadout presets, your gear can be more easily customized to face larger challenges. As for Armor Ignore, more resistances and weaknesses instead of more armor, to bring elemental and AP to an even keel (action RPG way).

12. **Weapon balances?** Ignis damage type may be changed (AOE)! Grakata will probably get a crit boost, Braton we've yet to look at but it's on the list.

13. **Blocking mechanic: any word?** It's a romantic idea, but it's not working out now. Maybe bring mods into it, to make it better? Maybe weapon specific? 

14. **Stealth?** AI improvements: more behavioral, not animation based. In the works!

15. **Improvements to longswords? Currently they're outclassed by other weapons.** Broad balancing!

16. **What does Sheldon do?** He manages the studio! #TattooSwag

17. **When will Vor's Prize episode be released?** Hopefully Update 10, but Gamescom will steal some dev time.

18. **Next female prime?** Mag!

19. **Best defense from loan sharks?** Rhino, Nova, Vauban, Loki

20. **Any improvements to particle lighting?** Of course! They showed a short tech video

21. Trading system is still in the works! We don't want it to be like Path of Exile's spammy communication. We want to avoid a bad system, but it's super important to us to have a system of trading.

22. We'll try to separate DOF and Motion Blur as two different options.

23. **Where will Volt be farmable if Necro will drop from Golem?** Uhhh...

24. **Is colorblind support coming soon?** We are still researching stuff, breaking old habits in our design. We will change emissives to have patterns as well as color.

25. MOAR SENTINEL WEAPONS INCOMING

26. Radically changing Rescue missions: Spacewalking!??

27. No wall cover system; movement and agility are the core of the game.

28. Swimming? Uhh...

29. **Ember and Trinity changes?** We're keeping it a secret for now!

Here's my thinking, if a warframe has a high armor level it either has a chance to resist staggers or it has a different less noticeable stagger animation. I feel that this would allow the larger frames that are also crazy slow to feel a bit more tanky.   

I was also thinking that if a warframe has a faster base sprint speed that they should be able to get up from knockdowns slightly faster, this could not be changed with mods but would allow frames like loki and ash to feel a bit more mobile. At leas it makes sense in my mind.

I am highly irritated over the fact that switching weapons/warframes/sentinels often result in uninstalling the mods on each items in order to transfer them on the next gear you want to roll with.

The best solution I personally came up with is this one: Mod presets

http://i.imgur.com/SfzuOnK.jpg

What this basically would do, is save your current mod configuration on a specific item through 3 different tabs (possibly more). These mods are labeled with unique ID's so the game remembers them, when you switch items and are about to equip the same mod ALREADY equipped on another item of the same type, a window notice will appear notifying you about the mods detached on that item to the item you are currently equipping.

 As a result, the mods are always available right away when switching gear, and you don't have to remember your previous configuration every time you make a switch, nor go trough dozens of mod pages when equipping them.

It doesn't accomplish what it's supposed to do due to a few problems.


**PROBLEMS**:  The psychic bolts will often hit the ground in front of the nyx before picking a target, destroying themselves.

Psychic bolts will not path around terrain and will hit things on the way to their target, destroying themselves.

Target prioritization is wildly inefficient. Oftentimes one bolt will go to each target, and the rest will pile on the last one, rather than spreading out evenly.

Flat damage is too low for the numerous problems to be acceptable.

**PROPOSED SOLUTION:**

As they are *psychic* bolts, make them pass through terrain and objects since they have so much trouble avoiding objects around them. There's no way to steer them out of the way.

Have them spread out evenly on targets so that the small damage that they do is used efficiently.



Nyx's psychic bolts would be effective and fun to use as a fire and forget ability.

These problems are most evident on grineer defense missions, where I did 90% of my testing.

1370047589.0,34,self.Warframe,1ffte6,[Lore] Conjecture on the Origin/Identity of the Stalker,40,6,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1ffte6/lore_conjecture_on_the_originidentity_of_the/,"Due to Warframe still being in beta, we've been given relatively little with regards to lore. This is especially noticeable when researching the Stalker; one can hardly find consistent accounts on game-play information about our shadowy friend, much less a back-story. While this is to be expected when one deals with a game in the beta phase, I am inclined to believe that we have been given more lore than can be deciphered from the surface, most notably on the Stalker. Through dialogue and some game mechanics, DE may have revealed who/what the Stalker is and where they/it came from.

I was attempting to farm the Stalker through the popular method of killing an easy boss, usually J-3 Golem (which was the case for me), and solo speed-running through M Prime. While speeding through Themisto, the lair of Golem, I was subjected to Lotus briefing me on the hulking monstrosity. Lotus said that Golem was created by the Orokins themselves as a super weapon in an ancient war against ""The Sentients"", an ancient enemy the Technocyte Plague was made to destroy. There is virtually no information on these ""Sentients""; all we know is that they waged war against the Orokins. In retaliation, the Orokins created the Technocyte Plague, which resulted in the Infested we fight today.

My theory is that the Orokins attempted to create an army of autonomous Warframes to fight their battles for them, but their creations exceeded expectations and achieved consciousness. These Warframes without hosts rebelled against the Orokins, possibly due to being treated as dispensable forces rather than individual conscious beings or perhaps out of some warped/malfunctioning sense of justice, swore vengeance upon the Tenno, and became known as ""the Sentients"". I propose that the Stalker is a remnant of ""the Sentients""; this can be seen in his arsenal. As the Technocyte Plague's victims ravaged ""the Sentients"", naturally they would develop some means of effectively combating the hordes of Infested; the Stalker's arsenal contains weapons that all have some advantage over the Infested. Dread (the bow) and Hate (the scythe), the Stalker's primary weapons, both deal 3x damage to non-Ancient Infested units. Despair (the kunai) prevent Infested Runners from exploding upon death; however, they only deal half damage to light Infested units, which is why their armor-piercing capabilities lead me to believe that they were used to hunt down Tenno and served only as a last resort against the hordes of Infested. While these may simply be game mechanics with no ulterior meaning, I believe there is enough evidence to support the idea that these are subtle hints about the lore of Warframe and the Stalker.

The real mystery of the Stalker lies in its motives. We can only speculate as to why the Stalker would hunt down Tenno for assassinating important Grineer, Corpus, and Infested figures; there are plenty of possibilities, so I will offer just a few:

* ""The Sentients"" have cultivated a grudge against the Orokins that has festered and morphed into a blind rage towards the Tenno. However, the Stalker knows that it has limitations, so it watches and waits until its prey is vulnerable; its most common tactic is to strike after its target has been exhausted from fighting its way through a facility to engage in a tiring battle with a heavily armed PoI. The fatigue from the assassination, coupled with that of the current mission, leaves the Stalker's victim in a weakened state.

* The Stalker's warped sense of justice and/or hatred towards the Tenno causes it to assume the role of devil's advocate: it would normally not think twice about slaughtering Grineer, Corpus, or Infested forces, but it sympathizes with the notion of annihilating the Tenno. When the Stalker witnesses these factions being struck down, it sees a relation to ""the Sentients"" being oppressed by the Orokins. By using the assassination of an important figures from the factions as justification for murdering the Tenno, the Stalker can maintain the illusion of honor by fulfilling the role of a righteous executioner, striking down the oppressive overlords.

* ""The Sentients"" may have been active in the shadows while the Tenno were in cryogenic stasis, quietly observing the state of the galaxy and waiting for the perfect moment to begin their conquest. Ambitions to prove their worth as conscious beings could be what motivated ""the Sentients"" to rebel against their masters and now they seek to become the modern equivalent to the Orokins. The supremacy of ""the Sentients"" is threatened by the re-awakening of the Tenno, so a silent campaign has been waged against their fiercest warriors to ensure ""the Sentients"" are successful in their impending invasion of the pandemoniac galaxy. (The Stalker belonging to some sort of group is supported by one of his dialogue options upon defeating a Tenno: ""[Player] shall not trouble us again.""

TL;DR- The Stalker is a ""Sentient"", an autonomous Warframe that rebelled against the Orokins.

I appreciate any criticism you can offer, so please feel free to provide it in the comments.

EDIT: I omitted some of my theory, namely the Stalker's possible motives for hunting Tenno, due to the fatigue and lethargy caused by a long day.

Happy Farming, Tenno.

But I'm getting tired of being constantly stunned and the new update seems to have added yet another grineer stunning guy in the form of a melee guy who can actually pull you at the same time (tho maybe I've just never come across him before).

I'm really enjoying this game apart from the stuns which seem extremely cheap and far, far, far too often. It's just a completely unfun mechanic in my book, as you lose complete control. So I'm not playing, I'm just helplessly watching some random animation that I can't stop. I'd accept it occasionally but in some maps it seems to happen every 10 seconds. I would prefer the enemy to just do more damage rather than completely owning them but then suddenly finding yourself stunned in the middle of 10 enemies stunned and dying while not being able to do anything to GTFO.

It's like someone on the dev team has a massive hard on for stuns and can't stop himself adding them to every enemy. And I'm not even at the point where I get multi-balled yet, though very close and dreading it.

Should I just man up or do others agree? Has warframe gone too far with stuns?",,False,self,t5_2urg0,False,,,True,t3_1exqat,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1exqat/do_you_think_stun_fun/,

**RHINO**

May 21st @ 2:00 PM EST UPDATE

The following changes are being made:

1) He will now again have full invulnerability, but up to a damage (d) cap of: 200 d, 400 d, 600 d, and 800 d based on mod rank.  Thoughts?

2) He now aggro's enemies to draw fire by using Iron Skin, as enemies now see him as a big threat!

 

Expect these in an upcoming Update.

 

**8) ... and Banshee? What about her Sound Quake?**

 

I believe the damage Sound Quake now does is working as intended... but being vulnerable during the casting animation is problematic. Will inform and suggest invulnerability be returned. 

 

May 21st @ 2:00 PM EST UPDATE:

1) There was a bug where enemy's animation wasn't being affected by her sound quake, this has been fixed. Enemies will not be able to walk through the Sound Quake to attack Banshee. Although, some at a distance may be able to, so be strategic in your Sound Quake usage.

1368133141.0,32,self.Warframe,1e0xkv,[FYI][Spoiler] Current unreleased client contents #2,35,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1e0xkv/fyispoiler_current_unreleased_client_contents_2/,"**Hello again!** First I wanted to say **sorry** for causing so much confusion about new Warframes and missing the FrostPrime (because it was already there at that time *sadface*). So for clarification:

* Darkassasin = Stalker
* Decree = Banshee
* Ninja = Ash
* Medusa = Saryn (sorry for ruining that, really)

So again, I am sorry for the confusion and I will do better, promise. At least the guys at DE propably had something to laugh about  :|

Please keep in mind: DE uses a lot of internal names for already implemented stuff, so some names could be a meaning for already implemented content. A good example is ""CrossBolt"" (a weapon). It could already be implemented under a different name, but it could also be a new weapon they are working on.

Anyways - **the new stuff**:

**Current** version: ~~2013.05.09.10.19~~ 2013.05.09.10.58 (they just added hotfix #2)
**DEV** version: 2013.05.09.14.00

* **Crossbolt** (weapon) (*it's not the Boltor, since Boltors internal name is BoltorRifle/Boltor, also at this point I am unable to tell whether it is gonna be a weapon for players or for enemies or both*)
* **StalkerBow** ( *=&gt; Weapons/Tenno/Bows/StalkerBow | seems new, because it apparently is missing textures, but don't know for sure. Paris internal name is ""HuntingBow""*)
* **ElectricBolt** (*caution: Could be anything! Only shaders have been added yet*)
* **PowersuitAbilities** (*stuff that the Warframes can do*) contains stuff like ""DojoBuilder"" (*because enabling the Dojo building UI is actually a skill that is triggered*). It also contains something called ""**SecurityCamera**"", which is interesting, because it suggests that you can actually use it and look at the picture. If so, then: Why would you need it? Infiltrators in your clans Dojo? I am just trying a shot in the dark here, keep that in mind! (/u/catalyst2222 mentioned: ""Security camera skill is for spectating duels i guess"", good point!)
Also new PowersuitAbilities: BouncePad, ElectricCanyonElectricity, LinkAbility, ProjLauncher, TableLib, ZapProbe
* **SuperMOA** received some new stuff: Meshes, textures and so on
* In the 5th livestream they were talking about a **cube-kind of sentinel**. So the client containes some ""**OroDCube**"" stuff, a lot of it actually, and it has been updated aswell (yes, it was there a few weeks ago, but I couldn't match it to anything at that time - it also could just be something for the Dojo, derp)

Actually there is a shitload of more stuff, they have been really working on very much things. I just didn't list it in here because it is already known content of update 8 - that will also be the reason why there isn't so much ""new"" stuff (the downside of reading my posts, sorry). 

Thanks for the huge amount of feedback in my first post, I hope this one is raising your interest as well.

I’ve noticed a lot of negativity on the official Warframe forums concerning the latest patch but more specifically, the Operations mission we as a community have been tasked with. The common response to the Fusion MOA slaughterfest has been one of disdain and hopelessness; many people are arguing that the bar has been set too high or that the grind is pointless, monotonous and without incentive. I’m here to argue the opposite and explain why this is such an effective tool for the developers and players alike.

First, I’d like to start by saying that many of the members of Test Clan Please Ignore are *elated* by the introduction of Operations missions. Our teamspeak server was blowing up with excitement as we formed many four-man groups to start diving into the fray. Perhaps this is because we recognized it for what it was: new content.

I will go so far to say that this is much more than just a new enemy or type of mission; this is an excellent way for the development team to *test* new introductions to the game. We must be mindful of our current position as players within Warframe, we are **beta testers**. With the release of Operations and the new Fusion MOA, the devs need some serious numbers to calculate balances; what better way than have us kill millions of them in a short period of time?

This is also a rather interesting way to build upon the story and architecture of Warframe. As it stands, Europa is the only “planet” without a boss and as such holds little value to players. By introducing a new enemy unit that is exclusive to this location, with a mission that promotes global unity in order to complete, we are effectively shaping the outcome of the future of the game. I’m suggesting that perhaps we’re more than just players in a static game; we *are* the game.

The Operations event is also unifying players and encouraging us to form and strengthen bonds between one another. As we strive to complete this seemingly impossible goal (and it is far from impossible) we’re creating memories with our friends and clan mates. I can think of no better way to bring together a global community of gamers than to give them one massive goal to complete, for better or worse. I can say, from personal experience, that I’ve already grown closer to the people I spent all night with grinding toward the completion of this task. (All four of us will remember the excitement and comradery we felt when wave 5 in our defense mission yielded a Hell’s Chamber.)

As for incentives… well, we were going to farm somewhere else in the solar system anyway, why is this any different? If 3k Rubedo for just a few hours of play testing a brand new enemy isn’t enough, consider the affinity, mods and potential for new content. This is just speculation but perhaps reaching the 100% mark will yield a Europa boss that drops the blueprints for a new warframe or weapon(s).

I feel at this point I’m preaching to the choir, so I’ll cut it short. I just wanted to get this out in the open and let you all know how excited I am for this update. Good luck, Tenno.

**With Test Clan Please Ignore leading the vanguard, we’ll surely complete this mission.**

That said, even compared to games that are more expensive than they should be for ftp games, At 5 bucks for 75 plat, and 30 bucks for 570, it seems a bit ridiculous. Fudging the comparison in Warframe's favor, that means that warframe is priced as if a league of legends hero had an average cost of 15 bucks. Not sure if anyone remembers planetside 2 prices (or was it tribes, they too similar in my memory) where they halved (?) all the prices because of the outrage. Also if I buy some plat, and the warframe devs halve costs or double plat values, and I boned because I bought plat early?

Also the founder thing seems like a decent deal, especially the 50 dollar one because it gives you excal + a potatoe + the warframe slot +  the platinum. And I wanna give the devs my money.

Edit: Loads of people are saying the issue is that there is no endgame at all, and so buying your way there fucks the game royally. I agree completely. The best! fix is to have there be an in game endgame not achievable through throwing any amount of money at warframe. Or for there to be pvpesque missions, even if the devs are 100% against pvp (which they shouldn't be) but two teams of two spawning cross map each trying to complete and objective before the other works.

Do the more experienced players have any tips as to how to overcome these challenges?

To quote the request:

&gt;a discussion topic for warframe which involves **how newer players feel about the current difficulty and pacing of warframe.**

&gt;The main reason I'm asking this is because conversation popped in up in clan chat, and I realized that a fair amount of stuff veterans take for granted are not necessarily available to older players. For instance, a level 20-ish kril is vastly different from a level 60-ish kril, and control modules have been bumped up in terms of requirements, as hyena's now the high 50s rather than mid 20s.

&gt;Most older people had a hoard of morphics stashed due to closed beta farming vor, and the recent bug with raptor's introduction meant people refreshed their supplies as well. It ties into the whole high-fifties hyena, but I still feel it's also another significant aspect that adds more of a skewed perspective in regards to older players vs newer players.

&gt;**I just feel that there's a disconnect between older and newer players, and would like to know what the community feels in regards to this topic.**

As you can see I will be having a good time making some propaganda posters for fun and lore.

The font needs to be rounded out and polished and a fix for some spacing issues when you drop down a line. Right now it creates some crowding. This is what I have on the burner for maybe this weekend or beginning of next week.

Once I am done with it I will release it to the community so we can all make some great Warframe designs, posters and propaganda stuff.

Now, here is what I need form you. The J K Q X and Z letters are my own creation. This needs to change and what you can do is message DE so they can expose these letters :) We want to be accurate right? Or maybe they have the font for us and I can go back to playing the game :)

Imagine a space in your dojo that collects various aquatic specimens for observation--but its not a room for scientific investigation or research, but rather a place of meditation and reflection. Glowing blue aquariums, the soothing sound of bubbles, and the entrancing slow movement of marine animals set the tone for this space, while also offering a hint towards undiscovered places and life forms of the Warframe universe. Customization options could include aquarium sizes and placement, lighting or tinting controls on the fish tanks (want your water to be red?), or perhaps you even choose what specimens you want in your Aquarium.

[Statue Room](http://i.imgur.com/YmKtDCz.jpg)

I'm not sure what this reminds me of more, a museum or the Batcave. Glass display cases, trophies, banners, pedestals, and statues that reach the ceiling. This space really feels like the central location for your clan to catalogue and display their exploits as memorials. Did you take down Councillor Vay Hek in the Earth system? Add his shattered mask to your showcase. Did your clan come out on top during the Fomorian Invasion? Place a 70ft statue of a Grineer mothership to loom over everyone. Did your Clan top the leaderboards (coming soon) this week ? Fly a banner that proclaims your triumph! We'll provide the objects and spaces to display your gear, you choose what to display!

They all follow the same formula but with different exponents and multipliers:

* Damage:  
(current_level - base_level)^1.5 * 0.01 * base_damage + base_damage
* HP:  
(current_level - base_level)^1.75 * 0.01 * base_hp + base_hp
* Shield:  
(current_level - base_level)^1.4 * 0.01 * base_shield + base_shield
* Armor:  
(current_level - base_level)^1.4 * 0.01 * base_armor + base_armor

Legend:

* base_level: the minimum level the mob can be (this is usually 1 but it goes up to 15 for heavies)
* current_level: the mob's level you see in game
* base_damage, _hp, _shield, _armor: values the mob has at its base_level

This means that a Grineer Shotgun Lancer, whose base_level is 1 and has 200 base_armor, has 213.93 armor at level 5.

**Armor** 
 
Formula:

* 100/(armor+100) * damage

If a mob has 200 armor, it would reduce damage to a third of its original (rounded down). Damage types that ignore armor do not suffer penalties from armor. This formula also applies to warframes.  
Damage cannot be lower than 1.

I'm CitrusAbyss, a Test Clan Please Ignore member and very avid Warframe player. We at TCPI have recently unlocked all of the clan weapons, and while I have not have the opportunity to try each and every weapon, I thought that it'd be nice to have a place to discuss all of them. Here is what I've heard about each of them thus far.

~~~

&gt; **ENERGY WEAPONS**

* [Prova.](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Prova)

It's essentially an electrified baton, and sucks. While it does relatively high base damage, it's *all* electrical damage - this means that it does nothing against non-Corpus enemies.

* [Dera](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Dera)

While it initially sucked, the Dera has since been buffed by the devs. It actually has a base damage higher than either the Braton or the Boltor, and is pinpoint accurate at any range (source: the Warframe wiki), making it a pretty solid weapon. Its bullet do have a flight time, however, and it cannot crit.

* [Supra](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Supra)

The sexy cousin of the Gorgon that sports a higher base damage (10 more, to be specific) at the cost of being a projectile weapon, rather than a hitscan one, as well as being more inaccurate. Its DPS, once the gun is fully spun-up, is very high, making it a very fearsome weapon. It seems to be the weapon that most people are grinding towards - but when I say grinding, I mean it, because it requires Mastery Level 7.

* [Flux Rifle](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Flux_Rifle)

The Flux Rifle is pretty much a laser rifle. It shoots out a constant beam of laser-y goodness which, while being relatively weak in terms of base damage, ignores armour. 

* [Lanka](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Lanka)

I actually haven't heard anything about it. 


&gt; **CHEM WEAPONS**

* [Ignis.](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Ignis)

Ahah! A weapon that I've actually acquired! Not that it really matters, since I've ranked it up to Level 2. Nevertheless, I think that it is ultimately a novelty weapon. All of its damage is fire damage, which makes it awesome against common Infested but less awesome against most other enemies. It cannot crit, and the flames **do not penetrate enemies** - this really sucks, because the whole point of a flamethrower is to engulf your enemies in a storm of fury and napalm!

* [Ogris.](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Ogris)

The Ogris is a rocket launcher - 'nuff said. Hah, but seriously, I haven't heard any complaints other than 1) you can't really tell when it's sufficiently charged to fire, and 2) you can kill yourself pretty easily if you fire near yourself.

&gt; **BIO WEAPONS**

* [Torid](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Torid)

The Torid is pretty much a poisonous grenade launcher that does some nifty AOE DOT (damage over time) - however, this depends on how long enemies choose to linger in the noxious clouds that it flings. Accordingly, unless you have a Vauban with which to cast Vortex, enemies won't really be letting you give them horrible, horrible Torid cancer. 

* [Acrid](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Acrid]

I've heard that the Acrid is a super-handy poison pistol that does some mad stacks of poison damage.

So, that's what I have to offer - second-hand opinions. I have yet to come close to unlocking most of these weapons, but nevertheless, I wanted to start a discussion so that we may learn what to work towards and about what isn't really worth the hassle.

1367088938.0,30,self.Warframe,1d8941,The HEK and You,42,12,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1d8941/the_hek_and_you/,"Hello, everyone.  My name is Twisted_Mentat and I'm here to talk about the shotgun nerf that happened recently and why I feel it was a bit much.  I'll say now, I'm going to try and be as unbiased as possible but alas, I do have certain opinions about how it went that I feel are valid enough to warrant a discussion.  I didn't want to react too quickly to the change but I've used it a lot since yesterday and feel it's time to say something.

Now then, as for why I'm making a post about this.  I've spent a long time with the HEK, in fact I'll say [a really long time](http://i.imgur.com/GnzEYTb.jpg).  The 60 percent used is out of about 250 hours, so needless to say I've had it for a while.  During this time I've seen the HEK go from being able to pump out a few hundred percent multishot easily with 8 pellets, down to 7 with no mods at all when update 7 hit.  I've since then worked hard and gotten it back to something [like this](http://i.imgur.com/l3iLQtk.jpg).

There was one thing that was unique about the HEK, to me.  The very thing that made me get it despite never using the Strun very much.  Even the selling point of it was ""The HEK is a powerful Shotgun that fires its shots with a tight spread, making it efficient at medium range as long as its strong recoil is properly managed.""

It was this that makes the HEK something special and powerful.  The tight spread allowed it to still hit enemies despite not being in what I would call 'Melee Range'.  It doesn't have the most damage, it's simply powerful in a wide range of situations.  This was something I enjoyed, a lot of my play style became more about kiting enemies (be they bosses or infested ancients) and shooting them as they lagged behind.  I simply knew that at any point I could put bullets into my target as long as I was aiming in their general vicinity. 

Was this balanced? Maybe, maybe not.  The idea of a 'Sniping Shotgun' was hyped and laughed about but these extreme cases were merely outliers and not optimal game play, it was still best to get into medium range before blasting.  To me, the super long range mob killing didn't matter since I carried a Lex.

This damage fall-off, however, results in a massive change that was all but targeted at the HEK.  Other shotguns (Strun, Bronco mainly) have more potential damage up close with the Strun having more crit chance and more pellets which, with the multiplicative nature of multishot becomes a monster, **and** a bar polarity slot to fit in more mods on top of that.  The Strun was already a short ranged weapon, best used very up close so you could put all of the shot in to whatever you were aiming toward so this falloff damage nerf shouldn't be a problem for it.

In the end, this idea that bullets disappear somewhere after 10 feet has always been a bit ridiculous, especially because shotguns seem to be the only ones that do that.  I'm not sure of a better alternative if a HEK nerf was still justified by DE, I honestly never felt like the ability to kill trash mobs faster was ever a big deal really since boss killing was still a job best suited for a damage over time weapon like Boltor.  All I can really say, through all my rambling, I'm putting away shotguns for now.  If I have to be sitting down with someone for afternoon tea to kill them, I'd much rather use a gigantic Axe.

After lots of math, I've sucessfully determined that the most overall vunerable weakspot is a Moa's midsection.

If you have a phobia of parentheses(bracknophobia?), stop reading now.

The ideal mod setup to use is a Ogris equipped with rank 10 Serration(2.65x damage), rank 5 Split Chamber(2x damage 90% of the time), rank 5 Hellfire(basedamagex0.9 Fire damage added), rank 5 Cryo Rounds(basedamagex0.9 Freeze damage added), rank 5 Stormbringer(basedamagex0.9 Electrical damage added), and a rank 5 Vital Sense((final damage)x(2)x(1+1.2)). I would add Primed Chamber, but It only affects sniper rifles and I don't think the Ogris counts.

The, the ideal situation for doing as much damage as possible in one hit with a Ogris is a direct hit to a Moa's midsection with a maxed Sonar spot on it from a Banshee with maxed focus, while under the effects of Rhino's Roar, and with a critical hit(assuming the Ogris' explosion can crit, and I'm not certain if it can).

Under these ideal conditions, the final damage is... 1188008.25. As in, so much damage that not only will it kill a level 1000 Moa instantly, but the remaining bits should logically be moving so fast that they could effectively penetrate shielding and turn even heavy armor into more flying bits, producing secondary, tertiary, probably quartary, and quite possibly quintary kills.

Its really just easier to say that under these conditions, it will die instantly, unless you spent three days in a single defense mission grinding up to wave 500.

Here is the equation I used:
(Those with bracknophobia, please look away now, otherwise I'm not responsible for any bracket-induced panic attacks)

Edit: The equation's formatting got botched for some reason, heres a fixed version:

((((((150+500)x2.65x2)x2)+(((150+500)x2.65x2)x0.9x4)+(((150+500)x2.65x2)x0.9)+(((150+500)x2.65x2)x0.9x2)+(((150+500)x2.65x2)x0.6x2))x1.5)x(2x2.2))x(5x1.3)=1404009.75


Edit2: FinalFina pointed it out to me that infested Leapers take 10x damage mid-leap, so, were you to get a headshot-crit on a leaping Leaper with a max Focus-ed Sonar on the head while under the effects of a maxed Rhino Roar, the final damage would be:

---------

 Been playing for a while now, and I feel like the inability to turn while being incapacitated, *and only able to back up from the direction you drop*, is the most jarring and frustrating part of the game.

I understand that the idea is likely to balance out high-affinity pistol users; I should know, I am one. However,

* The penalty of reduced movement and exclusive use of pistols while downed feels like enough in most games that have this system. You are no where near 100% effective.
* Being unable to drag myself towards an ally or cover except exclusively backwards, while most scenarios have you surrounded by enemies, doesn't feel like something a normal soldier would do, much less a highly trained space ninja.
* With a movement system that relies so much on moving and turning about, too often I fall in a position away from the enemies that shot me down, and not for lack of trying to actually aim towards them for when I go down.
* The idea of being incapacitated but able to fight back communicates to me that you should help clear the area or distract as much as possible to help your teammates pick you up, ala Left 4 Dead or CoD Zombies. Not being reliably able to do so can discourage teammates from picking you up due to threat of them dropping as well.

That being said, that's my opinion. How do others feel about this? Do you think the incapacitated state is acceptable, or even preferred?

- Fixed issues with the Transmutation feature. Users were unable to see or use mods resulting from Transmutation. Inventories also became unstable if a Transmuted mod resided within.  A script will be run to correct the inventories of players who had been affected.

- Fixed Ogris charge sound effect playing randomly when it wasn't being charged.

- Fixed being able to parry while ziplining.

- Fixed appearance of Ether weapons. Our weapons manufacturer apologizes for the defective translucency in the 9.5 model.

- Fixed rare loss of functionality that could occur when leaving/being disconnected from a session while in the main menu.

- Buffs to Orthos Prime, Slightly faster, bit higher base damage. Longer reach.

- Fixes for gameplay crashes.

- Fixed custom colours not applying to Miter saw blades or boomerang.

**-Ancients now have more distinct textures. Disruptors have incredibly bright-red mouths, Healers have a green-ish color to their mouths, and the Toxics now look more natural and don't have as intense of a texture.**

**-Infested Charger death sounds have been updated to produce a more dog-like yelping sound.**

**-Latron Prime sound updated.**

**-Excalibur's ultimate, when used next to Nyx's Absorb, gets absorbed by the ability, and when the absorb is done, Nyx can be killed by the projectiles.**

**-In the background image under the operations briefing, the Corpus are using Flux Rifles as opposed to their usual Deras. This could mean the Corpus will start using Flux rifles in a future update, and possibly introduces the idea of an ""Elite Corpus.""**

**-Rhino with really spikey armor.**

Just for fun, I did a mean/StdDev analysis on the hours of the day.  Mean = 32.125, StdDev = 3.026.  What that says is that the 500 and 1800 data points are mild outliers, but the hours of the alerts as a whole are quite evenly distributed.  

One thing of note, there haven't been any more of defense event alert artifacts since last week, and there was only one of each.  I'm not sure if that's just the RNG being odd or if their inclusion in the alerts table was limited or a mistake.  

In this week, there's a new piece of data included, the proportions of the different races that show up in the alerts (this is just the initial alerts, I have no way of knowing what happens when a second race shows up in a mission).  So far, I have just over 200 data points in that, which is enough to start having a picture of it.  There is some varience, but the data is close enough to the expected 33.33% to be random varience.  

Also, I've noticed that Auras do seem to drop more often, in general, than other types of alerts.  I'm assuming there's some form of weighting going on, either direct weighting or indirect weighting through multiple reward tables.  

Other than that, the data's just continuing to settle out into more stable patterns.  As always, please speak up if you have ideas for other data I could track.

	Changelog:
	 7/18/2013: Added in code to log what faction each alert mission is, /u/theloobster's idea.
	 7/25/2013: Added in code to the parse script to display the proportion of missions featuring each race

Here are some numbers that have settled out so far:

	Alert interval: 30.0 (41.5), +11.5 minutes
	Alert duration: 37.0 (48.5), +11.5 minutes
	Average credit value: 3140 (3600), +460 credits

&gt; Stamina +25%

&gt; Shields -5%


**NYX - ABILITIES**

* **MIND CONTROL** - 25 Energy

&gt;&gt;*Nyx invades the psyche of a target, confusing enemies and making them fight for the Tenno cause.*  

&gt;* Only one target may be controlled at a time.
&gt;* Duration of 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 seconds. This can be increased with Power Duration (Continuity).
&gt;* Target is stunned for about 2 secs.
&gt;* Range of 20 / 40 / 50+ / 50+ in-game meters. This can be increased with Power Range (Stretch), however you cannot target an enemy more than 50 meters away.
&gt;* Cost to equip of 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 which is then halved by the Polarity slot, rounded up.
&gt;* Mind-Controlled targets use their abilities to the benefit of the Tenno and to the detriment of their former allies. For example;
&gt;* The mines dropped by Mine Ospreys will not hurt Nyx and her allies, but will hurt the Osprey's former allies.
&gt;* The heal pulse of Ancient Healers restores 100 Health to Nyx and her allies. It also restores the health of the Cryopod.
&gt;* Mind-Controlled Security Cameras will ignore everything and never go into the alerted state. Mind-Controlled Turrets can behave unpredictably.
&gt;* Not all abilities or effects currently help the Tenno. Mind-Controlling a Shield Osprey will not stop it from generating a shield around Crewmen, for instance.
&gt;* The Mind Control effect will not work on bosses. However the ability still applies a short duration stun. 

* **PSYCHIC BOLTS** - 50 Energy

&gt;&gt;*Nyx launches a cluster of force bolts at enemies, using telekinesis to adjust flight patterns and seek nearby targets.*  

&gt;* 50 / 50 / 100 / 125 dmg per bolt. This is increased by Power Strength (Focus)
&gt;* Cost to equip of 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 which is then halved by the Polarity slot, rounded up.
&gt;* Does 300% damage to light infested units. Does normal damage to infested Ancients.
&gt;* Targets enemies randomly nearby to the original cast location.
&gt;* Seeking tends to fail unless thrown from a fairly close distance. (is this valid anymore?)
&gt;* Zoom in on enemies after activating ability to ""lock on"".
&gt;* 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 bolts launched.
&gt;* To prevent the bolts hitting obstructions in open-spaced areas, Psychic Bolts can be aimed into the air, where they will seek their own targets. 

* **CHAOS** - 75 Energy

&gt;&gt;*With a powerful psychic blast, Nyx causes mass hysteria on the battlefield by confusing all enemies to attack random factions.*  

&gt;* Duration of 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 seconds. This can be increased with Power Duration (Continuity).
&gt;* Range of 15 / 20 / 22 / 25 in-game meters. This can be increased with Power Range (Stretch).
&gt;* Cost to equip of 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 which is then halved by the Polarity slot, rounded up.
&gt;* Can only be reused only after current effect ends. The current effect can be ended prematurely by killing all affected enemies.
&gt;* Places a green holographic Tenno on affected enemies.
&gt;* Great crowd control ability.
&gt;* Enemies tend to attack the closest available target so it's a reliable ability to use. Unlike Mind Control, the enemies will still attack the Tenno if no other target is nearby.
&gt;* Stuns enemies for about 2 seconds just like the Mind Control ability upon usage.
&gt;* It can be used effectively on bosses with a group of enemies nearby. 

* **ABSORB** - 100 Energy

&gt;&gt;*Nyx absorbs all incoming damage and channels that collected energy into an explosive radial discharge.*  

&gt;* Does not have a base damage like other Ults.
&gt;* Absorption time of 5 / 7 / 8 / 10. This can be increased with Power Duration (Continuity).
&gt;* Range of 25 in-game meters at all levels. The damage is concentrated around the Tenno, causing fewer damage the further away the enemy is. Does not hit enemies behind walls or cover.
&gt;* Causes a small amount of damage to enemies even if no damage was received while in the absorb state.
&gt;* Cost to equip of 10 / 11 / 12 / 13 which is then halved by the Polarity slot, rounded up.
&gt;* Only reflects the same amount of damage it absorbs.
&gt;* Amazing in solo runs when swarmed by enemies.
&gt;* Can redirect ally damage that hits Nyx onto enemies.
&gt;* As of patch 8.1.3, shields are restored while in the absorb state, whether Nyx is being attacked or not (needs confirmation).
&gt;* As of patch 7.7.4, during co-op missions, it is not advisory to use this skill with the sentinel Shade. Shade will cloak Nyx during the Absorb period most of the time, whether the enemy is crowded around Nyx or not. As such, no damage will be absorbed as the enemy cannot see Nyx. During solo, the skill works fine still, as there are no teammates to draw enemy attention away.

But the mag as the potental to be a very good frame by doing the following:

- Pull:

1. this needs to be able to pull enemies that are firing at you OVER ledges. Nothing is more disappointing to an a ability that's only function is to pull than for an enemy who is firing at you from above to get caught on the railing he was shooting from. He should be PULLED OVER it.

2. at Max rank you should be able to pull at least 3 or 4 enemies to you. Leveling it up for reach only seems extremely lack luster. Leave friendly pull at 1.

3. Add text stating you can pull friendlies that need revive toward you on the ability. I just learned that from a tip turning a load screen after 30+ hours. This is a big selling point that I didn't even know!

- Shield Polarize:

1. This is User Interfaced based. To help a teammate that has low shields you need to find them and see their health/shields. In a major firefight you cannot even make out most people and that crappy z window doesn't help.

My suggestion on this would be To have an eye shaped shield and health icon above every warframes head that can be seen through walls.

The top would have a blue bar and the bottom red. In the middle would be the suit's class icon (and maybe with an 1 or 2 if multiple of the same type). This should be default with any frame with support, with toggle to remove.

2. Change the power it gives or takes from flat amount to percentage. This would help new players not be so useless to a group and give high level players or use out of it in difficult missions.

With these suggestions the Mag warframe would improve to a good level and not change the class dramatically like i see so many suggest on reddit.",,False,self,t5_2urg0,False,,,True,t3_1gycgq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1gycgq/as_a_mag_starter_that_has_30_hours_heres_my_mags/,

I was leveling up a new warframe earlier today by soloing a Kiliken defense mission when the Stalker appeared.  Not a problem, I thought.  Despite the relatively new warframe and unranked weapons, I have Link maxxed out.   I'll just use that and he'll damage himself while my Dethcube does all the work...

But...

I used the ability and my Dethcube was shooting away at him.  It all seemed to be going fine.  Then he lined up his bow and... His first hit caused me to lose control of my character.  The second caused the warframe character model to shrivel up into a ball that got smaller and smaller until it eventually disappeared (in a manner similar to what you see when someone uses Vortex).

I could still move the camera and though my Dethcube was invisible it was still shooting, but otherwise had zero control at all.  Weapons didn't fire, abilities didn't work, couldn't melee, slide, reload, or anything at all.  Eventually even the Dethcube stopped firing and I lost the mission.

What makes the whole thing really, really frustrating though is that the Dethcube managed to kill the Stalker and when it did... Out came one of those elusive purple balls of goodness.  I got to watch it time out just before I failed the mission.  Good times.

Known issue?  Has this happened to anyone else?",,False,self,t5_2urg0,False,,,True,t3_1gfxxo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1gfxxo/the_stalker_stole_my_warframe/,

1370161835.0,25,self.Warframe,1fiesr,[Gameplay Changes] A few ideas on minor gameplay modifications in Warframe,33,8,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1fiesr/gameplay_changes_a_few_ideas_on_minor_gameplay/,"I wanted to make this post when the question was asked about what DE’s plans on fine-tuning the gameplay aspects of warframe which were not changed since the beginning of the game (basically, common mob enemies, animations, etc) during the last livestream. I wanted to post a couple of my ideas, so here goes! 



 **Infestation Mobs** 

 Infested missions are supposed to be the mild horror element in the game, as what I can understand from the background music, ambient sounds and infested sounds in the mission. Perhaps the novelty stays fresh for the new comers when they do their first infested mission on mercury, but it wears off very quickly in the next missions. Now, moving on to the minor gameplay changes: 

* Almost all infested missions should take place in the new Grineer spaceship tileset. The reason behind this is that these ships are already dingy and dark, and with the power being out, it gets quite dark. The darkness could make the players focus more on the ambient sounds to determine where the horde is coming from. Right of now, all infested missions are more of a shooting gallery, hence I think this minor change could make it more interesting

* The general mobs ratio should be different for different tilesets. What I mean by that is, if the mission takes place in Grineer tileset, there must be more chargers than leapers/runners/crawlers  as chargers are the infested version of grineer. Similarly the same for corpus tileset, where there must be more runners/leapers/crawlers than chargers. 



**Grineer Mobs**

With the addition of Grataka as staple gun for lancers and Ignis wielding scorches, they are already well diversified. I know there are millions of threads on grineer modifications, so I will only post one minor gameplay change and move on to corpus.

* As we all know, Lancers and grataka make a deadly combo, especially at higher levels. And also we all know that they fire in bursts. Now at lower levels, the delays between the bursts were manageable, giving time for the tenno to dodge and weave through the bullets. But as their level increases, the delay gets shorter to such an extent, that it may seem that they are emptying the clip in one go. This is a serious problem, especially given that the grataka fires damn fast. Hence my suggestion would be to slightly increase the “delay” between bursts for higher level lancers. I feel it is the grataka which makes them dangerous, as they are usually a cakewalk in tower 3 missions where they have dera (I think), which fires slower than the grataka.



**Corpus Mobs**

Now, as the description says, corpus prefer to fight via robot proxies. But in reality, we see a lot more crewmen than ordinary MOAs due to obvious gameplay reasons. My suggestions are as follows:

* Only in corpus defense missions, there should be larger number of MOAs than crewmen because we know that the corpus are launching an assault on the cryopod. 

* We know that the corpus don’t use bullets, but why does Jackal and Hyena use machine guns as their staple main weapon? Snipetron was gone because it didn’t fit the lore, then what about these bosses’ weapons?     



**Basic Stealth Gameplay**

I wouldn’t talk much on this, hence I’ll just give concise points:

* Double XP and damage when stealth kill is performed.

* The console tapping animation of player must be added to the mobs who go to alert the base. 

* Control panels can be hacked to temporarily switch off the lights. When lights are out, the enemies vision will be greatly reduced. 

* Random distractions, such as blowing up explosive barrels and stuff should cause the nearby mobs to investigate.

* Mega Xp bonus to the warframe when mission is completed with no alerts and no kills (bonus modified according to mission difficulty)



Well, this is it. I know this is such a huuuge read for everyone, and I hope some of the devs come across this post. This game is a good game, and this is my feedback on the beta testing of the game.

**TL;DR** : Read the damn thing or GTFO. This post is about minor gamplay modifications which I believe could be implemented via the hotfix updates, hence please read through it completely.

1369913728.0,30,self.Warframe,1fbwx4,"[Meta] A bit of a rant regarding recent discussions on stunny enemies, and how people have been reacting to it.",42,12,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1fbwx4/meta_a_bit_of_a_rant_regarding_recent_discussions/,"Before I get to my main point, let me get you all fired up by saying what I think about stuns (for those of you who thought the Scorpions were just fine)

You can make difficult enemies without relying on stunlocks. That's just shitty design.

Big Daddies are hard (at least when you first encounter them) but they don't rely on stuns.

Balder Knights from Dark Souls are very fun to fight, despite being very difficult the first time you fight them. No auto-stuns there!

The football player enemy in super mario 2 (I think it was 2) was fun and challenging. No stuns!

The Hunters from Halo are excellent, challenging enemies, and they don't use stuns!

You can challenge the player and make him rethink his current plan without ripping the controls right out of his hands.  You can and should when he does something stupid, because a stun is *punishment*, but if you're punishing the player for playing the game how it wants to be played, then you're doing it wrong.  Warframe shouldn't turn into rainbow six just because the tileset now has scorpions. With Scorpions, the flow is interrupted, and this game is all about flow and finesse.

Games are all about learning patterns and coming up with solutions to new problems, but when there's no solution, and the player is punished regardless, then it's frustrating.

Cliff Racers from Morrowind are a notoriously awful and annoying enemy. No one has ever DIED from a cliff racer, but almost everyone unanimously agrees that Cliff Racers are fucking annoying as hell.  They didn't make the game harder, or more challenging, or more interesting, they made walking through foyodas annoying as hell.

I think everyone agrees that warframe needs to be more difficult, but that can be done without adding yet another stun to a long list of stuns in a game where it's all about wall running and being a motherfuckin space ninja.

I would love to fight enemies that out-ninja me.  The stalker, while still lacking in the AI department, is an incredibly tense fight! His slash dash is an instant kill, so you have to utilize your dodge movements to get out of the way while still doing damage to him. He's an EXCELLENT enemy, and he works very well for a rare encounter.  We should have more *bosses* like that.

((Let me stop you right there.  No, that doesn't mean I want insta-kills in favor or in place of stuns. One instant kill move that's quite possible to dodge from a rare-encounter enemy is *just fine*.  On a common enemy or a boss? A nightmare.))

does the stalker have a stun? No.  Do you see my point now?  I don't want the game to be homogenous and samey and bland and easy, and I resent the insinuation people have been throwing around about that, that just because you want something nerfed, you must want the game to be fucking COD (because that's the punching bag we're all supposed to use right?)

So stop getting pissy. We're better than this.  Why are you still reading this, don't you need more ferrite?

1369784111.0,29,self.Warframe,1f8e8x,POSSIBLE FIX FOR SMALL CLANS WHEN CONSTRUCTING A DOJO,50,21,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1f8e8x/possible_fix_for_small_clans_when_constructing_a/,"I've been trying to brainstorm a way of allowing small clans to have similar progress to large ones and have possibly worked out a system in which it would work without possible exploits from jumping between clans.

Firstly it would require some sort of clan bank or vault. Importantly this could only have materials stored and not withdrawn. The only way to spend the resources would be for members with appropriate permissions to use them for dojo architecture and research.

Edit: Seems like there is already going to be a clan vault implemented (how did I miss this?) [vault image
](http://i.imgur.com/HEZWUlY.jpg)


Edit: Just to clarify, members can still donate resources to dojo rooms while they are building

_____

Working with that as a basic premise:

* Members can farm resources and have them added to their inventory as per usual
* In addition to resources being added to a players inventory, the resources are also added to the clan vault
* The number of resources added to the clan vault scales as a percentage of the clan in your current party (I am aware that this makes 4 person clans the more efficient for farming than 2 and 3 person clans, but there may be a fix for 2 or 3 person clans that I haven't thought of)

_____

If you have say a clan of 100 people and they are all farming in clan groups (25 groups). Each group has 4% of the total clan and so every material pickup made by a player will have 4% of that pickup added to the clan vault in addition to the members receiving the full amount of the materials into their inventory.

So if everyone picks up a stack of 100 of a material then you will have 400 added to the clan vault.

Maths:

material amount * number of groups * number of players * percentage to vault = total to vault

100 * 25 * 4 * (4/100) = 400

______

If you have a clan of 4 people and they are farming of a group then your group will have 100% of the clan in your group and so every pickup by a player will add 100% of each pickup to the clan vault in addition to having the full amount to their inventory.

So if everyone picks up a stack of 100 of a material then you will have 400 added to the clan vault

Maths:

100 * 1 * 4 * (100/100) = 400

______

Notes:

* Larger clans will still have more materials available to be donated by players and so the scaling of materials into the vault for small clans may have to be exponential.
* The way I've set this up is just a proof of concept, I do realise that the numbers used just double the speed for 4 person clans to collect materials. In reality it would have to be much higher and scale smoothly so people don't try to hang under cut off points (4, 8, 12 etc.)

1376757789.0,27,self.Warframe,1kk19v,Improving upon the Endgame - A thorough comparison,33,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1kk19v/improving_upon_the_endgame_a_thorough_comparison/,"Hello fellow Tennos, 

--- First the obligatory small disclaimer 

Having reached Level 5 in the game i still greatly enjoy Warframe, but i feel the repetition as something that should be addressed with a higher priority. I'd like to share my thoughts and would like what you think about them. 

Speaking of that I really wondered **how** this really great game (and the endgame in particular) could be improved upon while still thinking about the development effort being necessary. Being a SW tester myself i often think in ""mechanical"" terms and how the word ""fun"" can be combined with ""maintainability"" - the later being things like bugfixing and game-balance of course.

Don't get me wrong here: I love the styling, the background story and the general ""feel"" of combat in the game, but the general approach is somewhat ""stiff"" in terms of mission choice, so i asked myself what do similar games actually do **better** in that regard. And which game should i compare Warframe to?

Surprisingly enough, the first game that came to mind is the ""Diablo"" series. 
Now before you now loudly scream at me, just let me ask the following question from a purely ""game-mechanical"" standpoint: 



**What kept you playing Diablo?** 

I'd sum it up with: Good Co-Op, Gear, Steady improvement of your characters - something that Warframe offers in copious amounts!



**What does Diablo actually do better?**

It (D2) surprised me with random amazing loot, rare bosses and interesting, nearly-endless choices to manipulate and master my character. The last point is particularly interesting, as teamplay and character diversity (for me) outweights the actual damage output, as it gives your character a ""role"" and clear purpose. And i think this is exactly the point: 


Warframe - at it's current state - is trying to define ""endgame"" by just having higher damage-numbers and min-maxing your dps-stats to be the best-in-slot. This will inevitably turn into a spiral of ""obsolete"" gear and a steady influx of higher level mobs, just to keep people entertained. I would call this the ""WoW-Syndrome"". This is (in my opinion) also a huge waste of potential, as the focus should be lying on the frames themselves by offering people more gameplay opportunities to shine in groups - other than damage that is. 

Countermeasures to rectify these problems could be the following:

* Mission Variety - If something *""just got interesting""*, the requirements towards the group should switch accordingly. Having more ""random"" things happen (see: Stalker) will surprise people and keep even the ""standard"" missions more interesting and lively. Random elite mobs, speedy-hack requirements or a timed-chase popping up will also keep people with utility-frames in the game. That said, these ""events"" could be balanced and randomized rather easily without breaking the whole system apart. 

* Stealth - This is a tough nut, as the general gameplay is not really ""Ninja"" to begin with. A special mission-type or mode could greatly improve the demand for stealthy gameplay. The best example are the nightmare missions, where people actually start to play together like ninjas and evade gunfights instead of running in like Arnold on steroids. I really like that mode, but it really suffers from the reasons mentioned in the next point.

* Conflict - This game has three clashing factions. Why do we see then fighting each other so little? Random encounters on an already-ongoing battle would be something that could really improve the immersion with a relatively low effort.  

* Balance - End-Game enemies in particular tend to just improve in terms of damage output, which is OK. The increasing HP-Pools however are **not** OK as they quickly make the game feel very unrealistic and ""bullet-spongy"" while also diminishing the fun you get out of your once-beloved boomstick. Furthermore this also encourages people to just rate each weapon and frame in terms of DPS, which is a real shame and starts to get the game into the bad MMO-Region again. Just look at the recent ""Nova"" and ""Kunai"" discussions in the Wiki and you see where i am coming from. This outright discourages people from buying what they think is fun and instead shifts towards ""what is endgame-viable"" instead.

So how could end-game be improved? 
I'd say: Make higher levels more deadly, that's OK. But do so more in terms of enemy weapons (randomly modded!), stealth awareness and general punishment when alerts manage to go off, thus encouraging the Tenno cell to be fully aware of what mobs do. Also adding more ""random"" strong mobs with a kind of command-aura would be more of a highlight to people (and a demand for focus DPS) instead of throwing tons of identical meatwalls at the Tenno.

Personally, I can't feel especially invested in the outcome of this event- the best thing I'm going to get out of it for my effort is a badge.

Here's my idea:

Now obviously it'd be exactly like the MOAs' rail guns. You can change the color of the beam by changing the energy color. It could be a gun built from the dojo. Either that or you farm parts from T3 towers (which would be much better given the damage I'm thinking it should have).

It could have a charge time like the Lanka. Now here's where it gets fun. The damage should naturally ignore armor. Infinite penetration through walls, objects, and enemies, just like the MOAs. It could deal **250 damage**. Unmodded. Rank 8 or even 9 requirement. The catch is that every time your character fires the rifle, he stutters like when a runner explodes next to you (not like when it knocks you down completely). It should also have a fairly low ammo pool (just enough to get you through a mission if you're not spamming it). Kinda like how the Gorgon is with ammo.

*But that's only 50 damage above the Lanka! Why the high rank requirement?*

For one, it's normal damage with armor ignore, not electric. Two, infinite penetration. But lastly, the damage when modded out completely. Let's assume we're running nothing but damage mods (and ignoring enemy multipliers). 

250+(250\*1.65)=662.5

(662.5\*.9)*3+662.5=2451.25

2451.25+(662.5\*.6)=2848.75

**2848.75*2=5697.5 damage. In one shot.**

Not to mention it wouldn't have a travel time and would be instant, along with 100% accuracy.

It should also sound beefy and have some bass to it, not like it has a silencer on it. I'm lookin' at you, sound team.

This is a mobile defense mission. It is in difficulty range level 18-28
If you wanna do this mission, you might require a frame that has some AoE or play with someone who has a frame with it. I played the map with a Nyx, and chaos + Absorb might just save the whole mission. 

In the mission i got about 120 rubedo in just one run.

Happy farming everyone!

Well, the Stalker (wut stalker!?) spawned on wave 5 for us, targeting me.  This is also pretty standard stuff.  I was kiting him around, not giving a heck, when somehow (I suspect the Nova caused it) we killed the last mob of the wave.  The reward screen popped up, and the Stalker wasted me within seconds.

We opt to keep going, but we noticed that there were Slash Dash noises periodically, as well as the Cryopod health meter being replaced with ""Stalker [80]"" so we looked around some and found the Stalker smoke cloud, going around and killing all of the Infested for us.

Things to note.  First off, I added in tracking of times when there were no alerts active into the average number of alerts active, which brought that stat down by ~0.4.  However, this still isn't perfectly accurate, because it's only counting instances, not tracking the amount of time each count is active for.  	

Second, I added in tracking of what hour of the day alerts start.  I even made it print out a nice histogram of the data (quite easy in Python with string multiplication).  The data does show some hours with more alerts than others, but the data is close enough that it looks like random varience, rather than weighting.  So, alerts most likely do happen evenly distributed over all times of day.  

Third, the new Update 9 helmets have been added to the alerts table, along with the three defense alert artifacts (Corrosive Projection/Infested Impedance/Shield Disruption).  

Finally, we can see that the numbers are converging even closer to what is likely their true value, especially of note are the interval, duration, and credit reward numbers.  
	
As always, if people have questions about the data or suggestions of other data to track/calculate, please ask.  

	Changelog:
	7/12/2013: Changed planet probability order to sorted by difficulty, rather than alphabetically
	7/15/2013: Narrowed average duration tracking to only ultra-rare and non-ultra-rare
	7/15/2013: Changed all instances of ""Artifact"" to ""Aura"" in the data set
	7/15/2013: Added in display of what hour alerts happen at
	7/16/2013: Modified concurrent() to also track when there are no alerts running. Data is weighted by
            occurances, rather than time interval, so it's still not a perfect average of the actual time
            each number is active.

Idea would be to give different multipliers for different rarity of materials so I would keep x5 for common with base of 500 (so you can get lets say 500 ferrite as a reward up to 2500). 200 base for uncommon drops (like lets say alloy plate) with x3.5 max multiplier and 1 base for rares with x3 multiplier max (obviously that would be rare as +8k cash alerts).

It would let the game be more competitive and clans could choose to side with one faction and would make Clans have a point besides weapons.

Another idea is a clan mission, similar to raids in MMOs, where people can work with the clan to maybe take territory from the other faction clans. This would also allow clans to have a bigger impact with the game other than dueling (and weapons like said above). It would only be available to lvl 30 people, which isn't exactly hard to get to, so people aren't under leveled and get shat on. 

I understand that this would be tremendously difficult for DE considering their small team, just ideas though.

Some ideas would be great, tell me if I'm talking complete bollocks ",,False,self,t5_2urg0,1372614237.0,,ash-scorpion,True,t3_1hdgrd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1hdgrd/suggestion_end_game/,

(Note:  I'm not sure how this works for skills that augment you, such as Contagion, Invisibility, Smoke Bomb, etc)

Honestly, I'd advise you to play with other people if you're grinding weapons, because it's just so much easier on you (more exp in total, exp comes faster, can level up weapons without using them).

However, if you must solo, doing mass AOE kills with your ultimate isn't going to help your weapons get better very quickly, so keep that in mind.

I like the latter theory, as it allows for a thread of Redemption as endgame.

What if we tie this all together, and link it with future PvP? It's all there.

Say when the Stalker showed up, and it killed you, the mission was immediately followed by your frame waking up in a recovery bay. Your next mission is you running aimlessly through a ship, following an objective. Your oppenents are all Tenno, and at the end you come across (a) Lotus. You kill her, and the frame you're playing becomes a Stalker. You are free from control, and you can choose to either continue on your former warpath or fight against other Tenno.

You can only play as a stalker on missions hwere you fall into the recommended level range. You enter, and your goal is to kill other Tenno, converting them. These Tenno will drop uncommon and rare loot and mods at a higher percentage, but if they kill you, they claim your (something...armor? some kind of sash? maybe this is triggered by putting on a 'stalker helmet' you've acquired?), and they can either keep it as a trophy or sell it back to a Lotus at 50k credits or so. Either way, you lose the ability to play as a stalker until you go through the whole process again, because they return your body to the Loti to place back under control again.

1376279745.0,25,self.Warframe,1k6p3n,I've been getting very irritated by a lot of Warframe's award systems. Anyone have any potential idea to improve it?,31,6,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1k6p3n/ive_been_getting_very_irritated_by_a_lot_of/,"TL;DR What are your opinions on the rewards systems in Warframe? I have posted some of my ideas and would love to hear yours.

I've personally found that a lot of the reward systems in WF to be flawed. For example, has anyone else ran high level defense several times in the hopes of getting Split Chamber or Thunderbolt? Has anyone else gotten item XP awards for a daily login reward while having a full set of maxed out items equipped? Has anyone else gone on a grind spree for void keys in the hopes of getting an easy tower to get a single part for a Prime weapon when you have all the other parts? I know I have experienced all of these, and I wanted to hear your take on the reward systems and their flaws.

A few ideas I had were as such:
- at the end of defense missions, one would get extra reward choices based on the number of waves past. For example, 5 waves = 1 choice, 10 waves = 2 choices, 15 waves = 3 choices, etc.

-Login Rewards: If you get a login reward such as XP when the item the XP was for is maxed out, you would be allowed to re-roll your daily reward. Or perhaps the daily reward could have multiple choices based on the number of days logged in consecutively, with a max of 3.

-Tower rewards: Towers could have a number of rewards based on the tier of the tower and the type of mission. For example, higher difficulty towers would yield extra choices. i.e. Completing a Tower that is level 2 would yield an extra choice, or a level 3 would yield 2 extra choices.

Another idea would be extra rewards based on the mission type. (This idea needs work but I'm just thinking here) Perhaps Defense or Mobile Defense could yield 2 extra choices, an Exterminate Mission could yield one extra choice, or a Raid or Capture mission could yield 1 choice (since they can be easily speed-ran).

These are just ideas that I've come up with while thinking about how difficult it can be to get a single item from a tower or defense mission that you need or want. I want to hear all your takes on the rewards systems in WF and would love to get some feedback, positive or negative, on my ideas.

I'm in the process of making a site and designing web apps for warframe players to catalog their weapon builds. Currently I'm getting some decent traffic, but I want to know what you guys think the site needs to look better, feel better, and be friendlier in terms of interaction.

Here's the site, giv'r a look!

I literally just updated the UI and so you'll probably come across a few bugs. If you find some, please post them on the forums using the ""Forums"" link at the top.

I'm currently working on making the build builder a little more intuitive and user-friendly instead of 'dropdown boxes' (something similar to the current unofficial Mod Calculator, drag/drop etc.)

If you could sign up, post your builds to establish my site's presence, I would greatly appreciate it! Even if your builds suck, I'd still love to have them. I'm implementing a comment and rating system very soon, so eventually the best builds will rise to the top. Until then, enjoy the site and lemme know how much it sucks!

You, as the warframe player are on one level higher than where the waypoint is directing you to go (pointing you to go underneath and back on yourself) As you want to drop of the ledge and face back the way you've just fallen, I propose that with a press of a button you can run off the ledge twisting in mid air and land facing the opposite direction, allowing you to carry on with your running in one fluid motion. I can't be the only one who is sick of rolling after the fall and then turning the warframe around to come back on myself? 

Thus there must be a more elegant solution, something along these lines?

What are your thoughts? 

Edit:
After playing some more warframe today I've noted that I tend to roll jump off the edge of things a lot (because its Hawesome, right?) and while doing so I often notice bad guys underneath me alot (instead of pressing Melee to come down quicker than rolling out of the roll jump) I'd like to press the button to make that 180 mid air twist button to come down facing them PEW PEW PEWing. I believe on consoles they have it as DOWN on the DPAD which makes you turn 180°  in a first person shooter.

While Afuris and Twin Viper (and by extension, the single alternatives) are both very similar, the difference lies in Twin Viper having higher damage and fire rate but lower magazine size and reload time.

This pretty much means that Twin Viper have higher 'pure' DPS (only looking at dmg*fire rate) while Afuris have a significantly higher DPM (taking into account reloading).

However, both weapons share a big problem, they run out of ammo in only a few seconds (25 seconds with Twin Viper, 22 with Afuris).

I made [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjdSQj-4dSagdF83Wl9RSzVINjBNS0VDSzBFZHNxQ3c&amp;usp=sharing) to show the stats of the two weapons.

As you can see, they both end up very close in total damage done (Vipers doing slightly more) and they do that damage in almost the same time (Afuris slightly quicker).

It all comes down to personal preference, neither is better than the other, they're both very balanced compared to each other.

p.s. I started looking into this with the mind set that Twin Viper was better because of dealing all its damage more quickly and being more ammo efficient.

Here is my suggestion for implementation:

Shields are equipped in the melee weapon slot, and are housed on the back when not in use.

BLOCKING: The block button is somewhat useless right now, and this would serve to bring it to the limelight, and provide an alternate playstyle than we are using right now. When the block button is held down, the Tenno switches to his secondary weapon, and holds the shield in front of his body. All incoming projectiles in front of the Tenno are blocked, and do no damage. Movement speed is radically slowed while blocking. The secondary weapon can be fired as normal. Energy consumption is minimal compared to blocking with a sword.

SPRINTING (While Blocking): If the Tenno sprints while blocking, he uses both hands to hold the shield (i.e. no shooting) and charges forward. Any enemies struck by the Tenno are staggered for a brief amount of time. Energy consumption is the rate of consumption while sprinting added with the rate of consumption while blocking. Hitting an enemy deducts a large amount of energy.

LIGHT ATTACKS (While Blocking): If the melee attack button is pressed while blocking, the Tenno will shove the shield forward, staggering an enemy in front of him without doing any damage. The enemy is vulnerable for a few seconds after the attack.

CHARGE ATTACKS (While Blocking): Charging a melee attack from a blocking position will cause the Tenno to dash forward a meter or two, and stagger any enemies he hits in this way, same stagger rules apply as per Light Attacks.

LIGHT ATTACKS (No Blocking): The Tenno whips the shield around to strike an enemy in front of him. The enemy takes moderate damage, and is stunned for a very brief amount of time (.5 seconds or so). Chaining these attacks together causes the Tenno to step forward as he swings the heavy shield.

CHARGE ATTACKS (No Blocking): The Tenno reaches over his head to grab the shield with both hands, and brings is crashing down in front of him, doing heavy damage to a single target, and staggering it for a few seconds.

LEAP ATTACKS: The Tenno leaps in the air, and smashes the shield on the ground, creating a shock wave that knocks enemies over. Does no damage, and the Tenno is immobile for a second after the attack.

That is my suggestion for adding shields to the game. I would have submitted it to the forums, but I didn't see any dedicated ""suggestion box"" type threads.

1362357015.0,25,self.Warframe,19luvh,Guide to Solo Leveling,29,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/19luvh/guide_to_solo_leveling/,"Greetings everyone, this post shall be a first in a mini series trying to promote discussion for more experienced players on this subreddit.  Newer player help is great, but I'd like it if there was simply more to speak about :).  The forums tend to only discuss things for as long as a thread is on the recently posted list.

Note that this guide isn't really intended for those looking to farm their first warframe, as one powerful weapon is also required (or rather it's the easiest way to do it.)

In any case, this is my guide to leveling your Warframes and other equipment when you must play solo.  Before getting started I'd like to remind everyone that leveling is much easier as a group, especially when your frame is very low level due to nothing really being required of you for missions to be complete. Sitting in a corner in Xini while your friends AoE the mob is pretty simple :P.  But alas, there are those of us that don't have those kinds of connections or simply prefer to do it themselves (such as myself.)  That is why I am here.  Please feel free to provide your own input, I'm certainly not the best player here, this is pretty much just how I do it and why. 

* Mission: Fossa, Venus

* Equipment: Anything you want to level, plus 1 strong weapon of any type (preferably rank 30 with rank 30 mods)

Now, why Fossa?  Well, there are 2 things in this game that give great amounts of experience points; Bosses, and Shockwave Moas.  These units are considered the heavy class of Corpus so each one gives about 270 exp, yet they respawn very quickly and almost infinitely (if you find the correct rooms.) They aren't even any harder to kill than regular Moas.  Fossa also provides you with the Jackal, another great exp boost, and Alloy plate which is used in pretty much everything.  

The general idea is to go into Fossa and use whatever weapon you want to level (or a high powered one, if you don't care about weapon exp) to kill everything.  This will take time, but that's good.  The more time you spend, the more Shockwave Moas spawn.  If you find the room with 5 robot spawners (or a smaller room where they are coming frequently) sit in there and wait until no more come out.  You'll probably have to keep moving due to potential low shield amounts and you can't let any of the shockwaves hit you.  I also happen to loot everything while waiting for spawns, but that's not a necessity.

When it comes time to face the Jackal, this is where you take out your one powerful weapon.  If the gun (or whatever) is powerful enough, you can pretty much keep the Jackal on the ground at all times by focusing a leg. This means that even with Rank 0 frames, the boss never has the time to actually hurt you. My current weapon of choice to do this is the Lex, as I know 1-2 shots to take out the leg, 3-4 shots to make it come back up again (with my mods.)  When it comes time to finish him off, down him and switch to the weapon you want to give the exp to and fire away (may take a few tries if the weapon is weak.  Above all, if he happens to get enough time to shoot grenades start running away as fast as possible.  You simply wouldn't survive a hit from them. 

After the Jackal is dead, be sure to kill the flying units in the room (over 100 exp each) and anything that comes running at you.  While heading to the exit, do the same as before until you run out of ammo.  If you happen to be like me and carry a bunch of ammo packs around, you can farm it for as long as you want so long as the units keep coming.  There gets to be a point when enemies only rarely spawn or stop all together, and this is a good point to stop and start over.

In the end, I average about 20k experience points per run, sometimes going up to 30k and this is without any booster (and if you're impatient and buy one, it becomes pretty ridiculous.) I haven't found anything that's been as safe or as fast as this when it comes to getting those pre-30 frames up to spec.  But hey, if you guys have, I'd love to hear your opinions and suggestions as well.

I hope this is able to help someone, it's been a pleasure and I hope to see you guys in game sometime. Add me if you'd like any other help with anything or just a friend :) .

1374767178.0,23,self.Warframe,1j17c2,Boar vs. Sobek,27,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1j17c2/boar_vs_sobek/,"Sobek: Impact damage type, 100 dmg (25x4), 2.5 fire rate, 4.0 reload time

Boar: Bullet damage type, 72 dmg (12x6), 5.0 fire rate, 2.3 reload time

Sobek deals 250 dmg per second, while Boar deals 360 dmg per second, initially.  Every 2 seconds, Boar will reload for 2.3 seconds.  Every 8 seconds, Sobek will reload for 4 seconds.

This means, Boar deals 720 dmg every 4.3 seconds, while Sobek deals 2000 dmg every 12 seconds.  To scale the dmg we have the following numbers:

Boar: 167.44 theoretical sustained damage per second
Sobek: 166.67 theoretical sustained damage per second

Due to the nature of these numbers, we see negligible differences in damage output; however, these guns are more than their DPS.  Boar's short-term ammo usage is far worse than Sobek's, since Boar devours it's clip in 2 seconds flat, while Sobek holds out for a total of 8 seconds.  Also, Sobek has a far tighter spread, with Hek's damage falloff, making it far better at mid-range combat.

In a damage type comparison, we see that Boar deals 150% head-shot dmg to Grineer, raising the 72 dmg to 108 dmg.  This means the max theoretical sustained base damage of the Boar vs. Grineer is 251.16 dmg/s.

Conclusion (tl;dr): Sobek is the superior shot-gun except vs. grineer.  Due to Sobek's mid-range capabilities and larger clip-size, it still might be the preferred shotgun even against grineer, but this is a matter of preference more than anything.  Sobek remains the most versatile between the two, and your ideal primary choice.  Boar is still useful as a situational gun due to it's high fire rate and wide pellet spread (ideal for hitting multiple targets with elemental status effects).",,False,self,t5_2urg0,1374797760.0,,,True,t3_1j17c2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1j17c2/boar_vs_sobek/,

After listening to the devs dabble about how they were reworking stealth in a few ways it gave me an idea.

They mentioned how there would be different levels of alerts within the ships during missions, and how if you were sneaky enough you could bring the alert level back down to enemies not even knowing you were on board.

What if you could hack terminals after the ship has been alerted, if you succeed you could play a log over the ships intercom to say something like ""the alert was a false alarm, there were never any hostiles on board, please get back to work."" Or maybe even something funnier like ""this was just a drill, if this was a real emergency you would be dead, Go back to training.""

And that resets the ship and the crew to being un-alerted to your presence. 

Ideas?

* There is one alert per ~29mins with a base duration of 29.5 mins and a max duration of 59.5mins.

* Credit reward is a min base of 2000 credits with ~50% chance of being more.

* ""More"" can include any or all of; 1) extra alert duration, or 2) extra credits or 3) a single '?' which is  always an artifact or blueprint.

* ""More"" appears to be determined by RNG on a table similar to D&amp;D loot tables. IE where the low numbers result in the base, mid numbers result in bonus loot, and high numbers result in bonus loot plus extra roll(s) on the table.

* DE adds in non-random bonus 12 hour alert rewards. This obviously ignores all the above rules. This non-random alert is always after a livestream ends and when the developers want to stress test something. Stress tests are normally on the weekend. Livestreams normally are Tuesdays.

**How can this info help you:**

* **At least one alert should be up at all times. If there aren't any alerts up then a new one will start soon-- Likely in a few seconds, definitely in under 5mins.**

* **If the alert was at 10:37, the following alerts will start around :07 and :37 and remain in that pattern for the next few hours.**

* **If you check alerts once per 49mins ([twitter alert](https://twitter.com/WarframeAlerts), etc) it's unlikely you will miss anything.**

* **Always make sure to log in 1 hour after an official livestream. These are announced days in advance via the in game News.**

1368828536.0,22,self.Warframe,1ejlxj,"Hey Tenno! You know how when you are farming for a frame, and the first 2 BPs of the frame drops pretty quickly, but that last BP just! wont! drop ? This is why:",30,8,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1ejlxj/hey_tenno_you_know_how_when_you_are_farming_for_a/,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem

&gt; The key to solving the problem is understanding that it takes very little time to collect the first few coupons. On the other hand, it takes a long time to collect the last few coupons. In fact, for 50 coupons, it takes on average 50 trials to collect the very last coupon after the other 49 coupons have been collected. This is why the expected time to collect all coupons is much longer than 50.

1367191839.0,25,self.Warframe,1dauwg,Maybe we're the bad guys.,32,7,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1dauwg/maybe_were_the_bad_guys/,"I couldn't help but think, while making Ash BP runs, that the Tenno are the assholes of this space universe in comparison to the Grineer. 

From the official description of the race, we know that the Grineer are in a state of bodily decay due to their rediscovery of cloning. We know that they took Earth by force, and that they are at the height of their empire. They apparently harbor hate and discrimination against the Tenno, based on some rivalry as Earth's last descendants. 

But if you kind of think about it, maybe the Grineer are at the height of power for a reason. It's clearly a society that can function to the point of being the dominant power within the solar system. And maybe they just need Tenno DNA samples to reconstruct their genetic code (if they can clone, they can clearly manipulate DNA). So the Tenno are probably being dicks to the Grineer and saying ""go fuck yourselves, we're better than you and we know it. We hope you die by genetic degradation as a species."" 

The thing that sparked my thoughts on this was when assaulting Titania to kill Tyl Regor. Our Lotus dispatch (I surmised that we're from the organization/faction called Lotus) told us that Tyl was one of the leading researchers in Grineer cell regeneration and repair, and that his research has the potential to single-handedly restore over 1000 years of Grineer cell degeneration. **And that we are here to kill him.**

Here's a dying species who are basically our genetic brothers/sisters, odds are good that all they really need is enough genetic material to repair their clearly decaying DNA, and the only potentially viable option is the Tenno. And we're basically resigning them to death as a species; essentially committing specicide. 

They assault Orokin reactors (Grineer defense) and research the Tenno genetics while we steal our cryosleeping brethren and slaughter Grineer by the hundreds (Mobile defense). From my perspective, they don't seem to be the ""evil domineering nasty empire that kicks puppies and pees on hamsters"" that the devs (or Lotus HQ) paint them out to be, instead they seem to be militarized out of necessity to assault the reactors that the Tenno seem to not want them to touch (maybe they asked nicely once upon a time and we spat in their faces), and basically keep the dirty Tenno from stealing their research subjects. 

We've come out of cryosleep with no memory, so who's to say that the Lotus can tell us anything they damn well please? Maybe we're the big dickhead corporation of this universe, and don't realize it. It would also explain why our Alerts pay so damned much money: We're mercenaries and glorified pirates under the guise of ""honorable,"" underdog space ninjas. 

Also, the infested are clearly nuts (but it was also created by the Orokins to battle the ancients, and it almost pleads with us), but seem to be more of a ""project gone wrong"" a la the Zerg in StarCraft. We're basically punching babies when it comes to the Corpus, since their entire military capacity comprises the MOAs, Jackals and Hyenas. I feel like the Corpus are the most neutral faction in this whole conflict, but we're still bashing on their robots, and beating their engineers up. 

Thoughts?

I like the idea of a gauntlet mission, where your only goal is to get to extraction. However, enemies will endlessly spawn (to avoid lag, maybe set a limit to max number of enemies that can exist at once), and you will have to travel quite a distance to escape. To prevent you from just rushing to the objective, at certain points, all doors around you would lock and you would have to kill an elite enemy that drops a key to unlock the doors again. Once the entire squad reaches the extraction point, you would have to hold out for 3 minutes to be extracted.

The only issue I see is that this mission type would be limited to high level missions, since it could be exploited as an exp grinder at low levels.

Any thoughts? See any other issues?

Vampire Mode+No Shields+Ruk= Good Luck.",29,5,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1jd3sq/i_love_the_new_difficulty_but_what_is_your/,"I want to stress how much fun nightmare mode can be, and how the new challenge is something I've been wanting for awhile.


*However.*



I'm starting to grind my teeth anytime I get put in the *almost* impossible situation of No shields, Vampire Mode, and energy drain on a boss level that takes an extremely long time to kill, or sports an artificially extended life expectancy (damage caps seen on Jackal and certain other bosses). 



One of the more frustrating missions I've just finished was a Vampire Mode/No shields fight against Ruk. Don't get me wrong, I didn't just run in there like a battering ram! I hugged cover, used Rhino skin (Wouldn't have gotten anywhere without it), but played aggressively enough so that I wouldn't lose too much health from dead time between kills. 



The problem came in the form of Ruk's undodgable bullet-magnet bubble that effectively shuts down your killing power for its duration. Naturally I had to resort to melee so that I could maintain my kills to keep my health up, so I tried to pick my targets carefully. This is when the difficulty hits critical mass.



1) I have no shields to prevent pins and needles damage from Grineer hitscan weapons.


2) Grineer are hitscan, so there is no avoiding damage if they ever get line of sight. Any line of sight instantly shaves off non-trivial amounts of my reserves.

3) My health is draining steadily, so I am unable to just wait out the bullet bubble. I have to maintain kills (albeit *very* carefully) so that I don't lose more health than I actually gain from the kills.


4) Sargus Ruk's bullet bubble has shut down all of my ranged killing power to prevent health loss for around 10 seconds. He tends to cast this every 30- 40 seconds.



5) Forced into melee to maintain my health reserves, there is no straightforward way to deal with hitscan fire when you charge the enemy. This aspect could potentially be avoided if the user is using a Glaive or Krestel.



I'm not saying it's impossible to beat the level, but GEE GOLLY it will be for 96% of the players that attempt such an ordeal. I even had the luxury of having both a Krestel and Rhino's iron skin at my disposal and was still dispatched in a hurry as soon as I made it to Ruk. 



I'm not really sure what to suggest about this though, as yes it was essentially impossible FOR ME at the moment, but I can see others seeing this scenario as the challenge they've always wanted to see in Warframe. I would only feel guilt asking for the devs to remove such a scenario from the game, but I can assure you that (at the moment) I don't have any choice but to abandon such a mission when it's clear what I've gotten myself into.",,False,self,t5_2urg0,1375208128.0,,loki,True,t3_1jd3sq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1jd3sq/i_love_the_new_difficulty_but_what_is_your/,

- severely crippling experimentation with weapon builds

This is such a huge quality of life issue that I wonder why it isn't being brought up nearly enough. Maybe because it only starts pissing you off as your mods get to higher levels, I suppose.

1373323432.0,24,self.Warframe,1hw8yc,Clan Tiers and Size Limits Coming Soon,29,5,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1hw8yc/clan_tiers_and_size_limits_coming_soon/,"&gt;The Dojo System brought with it the unlimited growth of clans, a problem we’ve known has needed solving for a while. The resources did not tier based on clan size, which has been an issue since day one.
&gt; 
&gt;Continued growth will create additional technical issues (Consider the scenario of a 7000 person clan all being on at the same time, that is 7000 unique connections hitting the game server and each other all at the same time). A lot of  highly-populated clans have attested to contact list and matchmaking issues, a problem that will only get worse with unlimited clan growth. Furthermore, complications emerge in events like this weekend’s when we want to have fair competition.
&gt; 
&gt;We are implementing something to fix all of this soon. The solution we have creates a new system: Alliances (Coming Soon!). Alliances have unbounded growth with no technical issues. Alliances can have an infinite numbers of Clans. Clans will be divided up by size and can have up to 1000 members.
&gt; 
&gt;The different sized tiers will be as follows:
&gt; 
&gt;* Shadow Clan (up to 10)

&gt;* Mountain Clan (up to 100)

&gt;* Moon Clan (up to 1000)
&gt; 
&gt;Resources required to build Dojo components will multiply by 10 with each tier (i.e. A Shadow Clan needs 1 Ferite, Mountain Clan needs 10 Ferite, Moon Clan needs 100 Ferite.) You can increase your tier by building a larger Clan Hall.
&gt; 
&gt;If you are in a current clan with over 1000, you will be split up into separate units of up to 1000; the choice is up to the clan members which unit they join. The original Warlord of the clan will be the founder of the Alliance, and all split-clans can join the Alliance if they choose to remain a whole like-minded and goal-oriented unit.
&gt; 
&gt;If your clan is affected by this (presently 13 clans have more than 1000 members, and of these 13, 3 will have to create more than 2 Clans), your Dojo will be copied for your new Clan so no work on your original Dojo is lost.
&gt; 
&gt;TL;DR? Clan size tiers coming, three tiers of clans will exist. Resources will scale per tier. Current clans with 1000 + members will be the first to form “Allainces”, a new system to allow unbounded growth. All Coming Soon!

**WARFRAME - POLARITIES**

* #4 [](/power) Scratch (Power) Polarities
 
* #2 [](/attack) V (Attack) Polarity



**WARFRAME - COSMETICS**

* **Reverb Helmet**

&gt; Max Energy +10%

&gt; Max Health -5%


**BANSHEE - ABILITIES**

* **SONIC BOOM** - 25 Energy

&gt;&gt;*BANSHEE emits a sonic shockwave that pushes targets in range with enough force to incapacitate or kill attackers.*  

&gt;* Damage of 25 / 25 / 35 / 40. This is armour piercing and increased by Power Strength (Focus).
&gt;* Range of 8 / 8 / 10 / 12 in-game metres. This can be increased by Power Range (Stretch).
&gt;* Cost to equip of 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 which is halved by Polarity, rounded up.
&gt;* Fires off a short range 180° forward cone attack that knocks enemies back/down and deals minor damage.
&gt;* Will knock down enemies through walls.
&gt;* Can be used while jumping, sliding, flipping, wall-running or wall-clinging. 

* **SONAR** - 50 Energy

&gt;&gt;*Using acoustic location, BANSHEE's SONAR power finds and tracks enemies, and exposes critical weak spots to everyone in your squad.*  

&gt;* Range of 20 / 20 / 25 / 30 in-game metres. This can be increased with Power Range (Stretch).
&gt;* Duration of 10 seconds. The duration is increased by Power Duration (Continuity) as of patch 7.10.0.
&gt;* Enemies within range will have a part of their body glow bright orange and be added to your mini-map until their corpse vanishes (akin to the Enemy Radar artifact).
&gt;* While glowing, that specific part will take 500% the damage that would normally be dealt to that body part. Power Strength (Focus) increases the damage multiplier.
&gt;* Can be used while jumping, sliding, flipping, wall-running or wall-clinging. 

* **SILENCE** - 25 Energy

&gt;&gt;*Ideal for stealth and intrusion situations, using SILENCE on unaware enemies will limit their perceptions and tactical response. Warframe attacks, gunfire, and enemy deaths will not trigger enemy awareness while SILENCE is active.*  

&gt;* Range of 25 / 25 / 25 / 35 in-game metres. This can be increased with Power Range (Stretch).
&gt;* Duration of 5 / 5 / 8 / 12 seconds. The duration is increased by Power Duration (Continuity).
&gt;* Casts in an area of effect around you, enemies will glow bright yellow. 


* **SOUND QUAKE** - 100 Energy

&gt;&gt;*Channelling all of her acoustic energy into the ground and surrounding environment structures, BANSHEE uses ultrasonic reverberations to violently shake the environment with lethal results.*  

&gt;* Hits enemies for 125 / 125 / 150 / 175 damage 4 / 4 / 5 / 6 times over a duration of 5 / 5 / 6 / 7 seconds. This damage is reduced by enemy armour, is increased with Power Strength (Focus), but not increased by Power Duration (Continuity).
&gt;* Range of 12 / 12 / 15 / 18 in-game metres. This can be increased with Power Range (Stretch).
&gt;* Cast in an area of effect around you, dealing damage over time that staggers all enemies.
&gt;* Banshee is NOT invincible nor immune to any crowd control during the animation.
&gt;* Enemies that move in to the radius will be stunned and damaged as normal.
&gt;* Can be activated while sliding but cannot be activated in the air, wall-running or wall-clinging.

An extra option like ""Host"" would be ideal here, because I have a good computer and a strong connection, so people joining my game won't lag. Yesterday I joined an alert where we had to defeat the Jackal, but the moment the boss fight started the Jackal just sank into the floor and disappeared. The objective completed, but the jackal didn't drop anything, and I also wanted to fight this guy.

I know you can click ""Play Now"", but you can only do that if the match making doesn't immediately find a game, and on Alerts that's very rare because everyone is jumping on them.

**Tactical Data RE: [Fusion MOA](http://i.imgur.com/byKHXpg.jpg)**

* Identification - White plated MOA, disc head, round battery pack

* Weak Point - Battery Pack.  Unknown at this time if it shares the same frontal weaknesses of other MOA.  Sensor suite is present, but the new laser mounting has a frontal cover.

* Primary Weaponry - Continuous Fusion Laser

* Secondary Weapon - Spawns 1x Drone (weak, no special qualities)

* Defenses - Toughest MOA to crack yet, but not by much.

* Strategic Advice - MOA must deploy in place to use its laser, and it has a limited firing arc toward its front side.  If you come under fire, running around the MOA to its rear will generally result in either moving entirely out of its arc of fire, or evading damage long enough to kill it.

**AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, SHOOT THE CAMERAS**

*Anectdotal information update*

* I personally found more Fusion MOA on Beleth than Abbadon or Armoros.

* Baal (Mobile Defense) seems decent in spawns

* ~~Defense missions Fusions at Wave 10+ (It is currently unknown whether or not killed MOAs count, win or lose)~~

**I HAVE AWAKENED AFTER A LONG SLUMBER TO BRING YOU MORE INFORMATION**

* Defense missions begin to include Fusion MOA at wave 5.

**HEK - POLARITIES**

None

**HEK - TIPS**

* Very effective against the Infested, especially when used with fire mods.
* Climbing mastery ranks requires leveling many weapons. Mastery rank 4 is equivalent to leveling 2 warframes to level 25 and 10 different weapons to max rank (Or 3 Warframes and 5 weapons to Rank 30).
* Ammo Stock mod rank 0 (+10%) adds no extra rounds to the magazine. Rank 1 (+20%) adds one round to the magazine (for a total 5) and Rank 3 (+40%) adds two (for a total 6). There is no need to upgrade the mod further as no additional rounds will be gained.
* Using the Shotgun Ammo Mutation mod can help regain ammo when needed, although not as often as the full auto shotguns.

**SOBEK - POLARITIES**

None

**SOBEK - TIPS**

* When using against Infested, add a Chilling Grasp mod to slow them down and give you more time to fire more shots or reload when needed. The Sobek has good accuracy and the 100% stun on Ancients makes it a reliable holdback weapon, keeping Ancients away from you and your team even at large distances.
* When extensively modified, The Sobek is best fired in short bursts of three to five rounds due to its high power. Unlike the Hek, the Sobek is not especially ammo-efficient; and its high rate of fire demands good trigger control or ammo boxes.

The sky's the limit, go nuts.",24,3,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1jypx9/what_content_would_you_like_to_see_added_to_the/,"I've seen several posts lately about people burning out from the grind. I feel it, we all feel it. What could they put in the game that would make you go ""This is awesome!""? 

Here's my 2 cents:

* PVP: I don't actually want PVP but I'll go ahead and put this here because I imagine it will be the top answer. If you're gonna put PVP please try to give some specifics about what you'd want: 1v1? Capture the flag? Team vs. Team? Some form of oddball or huttball?

* Races: with parkour and dashing I think there's some potential for racing through obstacle courses where the winner gets a reward. You could have a version with no opponents and a version with some opponents, not too many. Just a few who are there to mess you up at critical points where you have to make a judgement call to fight them or rush past based on which is quicker.

* Mega-boss battles: I'd like to fight giant monsters. What could be better in a game with space ninjas than giant monsters? Not Godzilla/Kaiju size, but larger than the Jackal for sure. I'd only like to see this implemented if there was a system with wounding to make it more realistic. Like if I shoot something in the leg enough I can cripple it, or shooting the eye to blind it or the mouth and it chokes. Bonus points if you can climb them to stab vulnerable bits ala Shadow of the Colossus. This could be a really fun way to get weird and rare resources.

* Large, outdoor planetside missions. Sort of a restricted sandbox mode, say a couple of square miles is modelled with an enemy base in the middle. Your team gets hot dropped in the jungle/environment and you have to complete your mission. This would be way better if stealth mechanics are more fully implemented as you can decide to sneak in or fight. Also would be better if the enemy had vehicular reinforcements like tanks and helos to fight against. Like campaign missions in Halo but larger scale.

* Warframes based on different archetypes. Pretty much every frame is ninjaesque in some respect, some more so than others. Vauban is obviously an engineer, and I'd say Frost, Nova, and Ember are more magelike. What about some frames inspired by samurai? Or gunslingers? Or swashbucklers/pirates?

* I know they've said that adding speaking parts for the frames and emotes like dancing are very, very unlikely or simply not going to happen. What I would like to see that I think is still in character with the game design is kata and meditation. A kata emote would fit right in and should be weapon specific. A meditation emote would not be too far of a stretch I think and should be warframe specific. This might not be feasible as there's probably not too many unique meditation animations that can be created but it would be cool.

Edit: Forgot something really important I'd like to see in the game because it was so obvious. 

* A reduction in the amount of farming and grinding necessary to progress. Some of this is good, you can't just give everything away for free but it seems like it's reached a point where it's having some detrimental effects and turning some people off the game. I'd really like to see 3 changes.
     * Make separate drop tables for modules and fusion cores. Basically mods would still have a drop table of all modules like it is now. There would be a separate, additional table for fusion core drops. This means getting a fusion core does not cost you a mod and vice versa. In rare instances it would be possible to get both from 1 kill.

     * Add or create an area in the game specifically to farm fusion cores. It sucks sometimes to have to use copies of the same mod to level one up especially if they're rare. Maybe somewhere in the solar system there is a factory that makes fusion cores guarded by legions of robots who are also powered by fusion cores? When you kill them they don't drop any modules but have a higher chance to drop fusion cores.

     * Increase the drop rates of modules and/or decrease the requirements to level high level modules. There are so many modules in the game that the chance of getting any particular one to drop is very slim. This makes it difficult to use copies of the same mod to level something up. Also the requirements to level things like redirection, steel fiber, vitality and the [weapon damage](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Serration) mods to higher levels aren't just ridiculous, they're insane. As in ""if you are willing to spend the time to actually acquire the resources to level even one of these all the way up there is probably something wrong with you and you'd be much better off to stop playing altogether and go outside for a bit"" insane. At some point doubling the requirements every level should cut off and just add 8 or 16 more.

Lanka:
Serrated Blade, 250 damage, 20% crit, 1.5 second charge time

Snipetron Vandal:
Armor Piercing, 125 damage, 20% crit 1.5 fire rate

This means Snipe-V deals 187.5 dmg per second, while Lanka deals 167.5 dmg per second.

With 60% Fire Rate bonus, here is how the weapons change:

Snipe-V deals 300 dmg per second while Lanka deals 275 dmg per second.

So yea... Snipetron Vandal is just better DPS-wise.  Big thanks to Nar0 for correcting my fire rate numbers. :D

The big thing for Lanka really comes down to ammo efficiency.  Lanka at max Wildfire + Warp Mag has 15 rounds, while Snipetron Vandal only has 9... However...

Wintermute24: ""Semi auto weapons like the svandal get their fire trigger slightly buffered by the game if you press the trigger just in the small time window before a shot may be fired again - so you can actually reach the listed fire rate. The Lanka, on the other hand will always operate with a small delay after being charged due to human inaccuracy. If you get the timing right, you can get closer to the theoretical fire rate, but you can never reach it.""

We had just arrived at the Extraction point when the Lotus gave us the bad news. Apparently there was an enemy left (spawned after we cleared the map), and she told us to ""*keep fighting. As long as the enemy is here, the tower is useless to us.*"" Then she said ""the Grineer should have known better than to walk into an Orokin tower unprepared. Let's clean up their mess."" 

Great. Problem was, this Grineer was nowhere to be found, or at least the minimap indicator was no help. It just had us going in circles:

[Here I am looking into the Extraction room](http://i.imgur.com/UbXtykL.jpg). The minimap indicates the Grineer is in there, but none of my fellow Tenno see him. [Then once you're in the Extraction room, the minimap says he's outside it.](http://i.imgur.com/btz2H3L.jpg) Depending on how far back we went, it either pointed us back to the Extraction room, or back to the start. We figured he spawned outside the map and was unreachable.

In the end, we had to abort the mission because it wouldn't let us finish and we couldn't find this mysterious Grineer soldier. Anyone else get this glitch before?

I don't mean dedicated servers on the scale of an MMO, with a datacenter somewhere full of server racks, I'm talking like Halo PC dedicated servers, where we, the players, can download software from DE that sets up a server to host games. Obviously in most instances that's not much of an improvement, but consider this: Player A has a very fast connection with 100 Mbps download and 75 Mbps upload, however they are new to the game and have only been playing for a few days. Player B is good friends with Player A and has been playing for months. Player B wants to take Player A into a tier 3 Void mission, but Player B has an awful connection with 1 Mbps download and 0.2 Mbps upload. What's one to do? Player A doesn't have the key, so he can't host. If we had dedicated server software that allowed Player B to open the Void with his key on Player A's server, Players A &amp; B now have a lag-free Void run using Player B's key.

Going this route could also drastically increase host client performance on Kappa and Kiste, which are notorious for having massive framerate drops when things get hectic.

People also don't have to be playing the game for others to get into a match. We've all sat there for 5+ minutes with the 'Play Now' button blinking at us, waiting to find a session, but if people had servers up, even those not playing the game (and thus having fewer available sessions) could still allow games to be played off their connection even without Warframe running, and without their participation in the mission.

* credits

* resources

* blueprints

* rare mods

EDIT: ~~in light of Foundation12's post there could either be a system where you vote to leave or stay, those who stay can stay, those who leave can leave. What are your thoughts?~~ Had an idea last night, well the point of these new objectives is that it would be like stalker, people would be excited over the fact that they have a chance at getting something rare. So I thought maybe the people that didn't want to proceed with these side objectives could instead go towards the Orange mission completion objective and just *disconnect* per say, while still receiving all the credits and anything they would have gotten in the main objective.

http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Armor

I would like to highlight this statement:

Note that armor does not apply to shields which take 200% damage from ice attacks and 100% from everything else.

Basically, what I think is that popping Iron Skin while your shields are **up** is wrong and you are just wasting it, because you will run out of those crazy fast. But popping Iron Skin while your shields are down counts the Rhino's high armour into the equation, which would make the skill last significantly longer.

The problem is that I can not actually test if the absorb bubble from Iron Skin is applied first (so modifiers like Armour would never apply to it even when you are out of shields), or if it applies last (which would make it work like I say). My future Rhino is still in the process of gathering blueprints.

If Iron Skin is indeed just an ""extra shield"" of 800 points that takes 100% damage from all sources, I would suggest to make armour affect the damage it takes. For a Rhino with maxed Steel Fiber (75% damage mitigation total), that would theoretically make Iron Skin last **4 times** longer than it does now.",,False,self,t5_2urg0,False,,frost-aurora,True,t3_1fbnbu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1fbnbu/rhinoironskin_so_i_was_wondering/,

Original post describing the experiment [available here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1dxwt9/the_great_kappa_experiment/)

_________
Had to audible. Only got four usable rounds for Phase 1 yesterday as I failed to make screenshots of the post-match report for the fourth round. 

Had to change up the plan again when I was pressed for time today, and decided to work with random groups of people to get data for Phase 2. In each of the games with randoms, I actively sought out enemies outside the defense area for defense site one and two. And my teammates did so as well, almost losing the objectives on several occasions.

I still wish to complete the experiment as originally described, with a control group for Phase 2. This may be coming in the future.

For the first 10 to 15 minutes, everything was normal. However at one point, something changed. I seemed to have become like a ghost. I could not open doors, enemies wouldn't target me, and according to my friend I was no longer moving. It was like the level no longer reacted to me, at all. The extraction point also didn't respond to me.

Now normally you'd think it was a problem with the connection, failing to update on my end. However everything else was perfectly in sync, and all of the enemies were still fighting and moving the same for both of us, they just wouldn't target me. I could kill crates and pick up items, although I couldn't open lockers.

We were on Skype, so we were able to do some experiments. I would kill an enemy, a crate, or cast a decoy in front of them, and they would see it update instantly.

The fact we were both on Skype made it still playable, and kinda fun. Since he couldn't see me, and the doors wouldn't respond, I had to instruct him on where to go, which doors to open, and when. I'd run ahead to kill enemies perched against corners, waiting to ambush him, and just round balconies to kill those trying to snipe. He also had to run and distract enemies, whilst I chased and attacked them.

We're getting new melee weapons fairly frequently but I can't help but feel that DE could have approached the system differently.

Right now we have a bunch of different weapons that are very similar with small differences in stats. We have cosmetic weapon skins like the Dagger Axe skins as well as stat skins like the Brok Hammer for the Fragor.

I can't help but feel that weapons like Heat Dagger and Dark Dagger could have been stat changing skins for the Ceramic Dagger this entire time, same thing for the Pangolin, Jaw Sword and so on for the Skana. This actually creates less weapon clutter, while still giving people some variety in appearances and function.

For free players it means they are less dependant on weapon slots in order to obtain a variety of similar weapons. This could hurt DE in terms if income from weapon slot purchases, so you have to take that into consideration; and it might mean more difficulty in obtaining mastery ranks.

Either way I feel that the skins option for weapons in Warframe has been under-utilised in comparison to the number of new additions we're seeing, now I'm not expecting weapons like the Glaive or the Orthos to be skins of other weapons, but I can't help but feel that the current selection of longswords, daggers and dual weapons could have been trimmed a bit in favour of stat changing skins instead.",,False,self,t5_2urg0,False,,ash,True,t3_1hgmmc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1hgmmc/whatever_happened_to_weapon_skins/,

For example i saw the plan to do a very high level defense mission and one of the requirements was to have an ogris, as ogris has no armor mitigation would it not become useless eventually?

Edit*

My apologies, i used the wrong term, when referencing best i meant specifically against scaling high level enemies, which take significantly reduced damage in all locations except their weak points which can not always be targeted. As such i am asking mostly what would be the best weapons to bypass enemy armor resistances. The armor pen/ignore are the obvious choices but i was wondering whether there may be some special effects like the Ogris which seems very popular but beyond my understanding as to why since it is nor armor ignore damage.
