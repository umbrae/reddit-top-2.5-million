Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course.
""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question.
So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep...

And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?""
""No sir!"" says the man.
""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"".
""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician.
""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.

The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other.
""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""

""Ah"", says Satan. ""You see, yesterday, we were campaigning. But today, you voted...""",,False,,t5_2qh72,False,,,True,t3_1fyl2a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1fyl2a/so_a_politician_dies/,

The German was first in line, he thought for a while and then said: ""Please tie a pillow to my back. This was done, but the pillow only lasted 10 lashes before the whip went through. When the punishment was done the German had to be carried away bleeding and crying with pain. 

The Frenchman was next up. After watching the German in horror he said smugly: ""Please fix two pillows to my back."" But even two pillows could only take 15 lashes before the whip went through again and the Frenchman was soon led away whimpering loudly. 

The Englishman was the last one up, but before he could say anything, the Sheikh turned to him and said: ""You are from a most beautiful part of the world and your culture is one of the finest in the world. For this, you may have two wishes!"" 

""Thank you, your Most Royal and Merciful highness,"" the Englishman replied. ""In recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20, but 100 lashes.""

In ancient Greece (469 - 399 BC), Socrates was widely lauded for his wisdom. One day an acquaintance ran up to him excitedly and said, ""Socrates, do you know what I just heard about Diogenes?""

""Wait a moment,"" Socrates replied, ""Before you tell me I'd like you to pass a little test. It's called the Triple Filter Test.""

""Triple filter?"" asked the acquaintance.

""That's right,"" Socrates continued, ""Before you talk to me about Diogenes let's take a moment to filter what you're going to say. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?""

""No,"" the man said, ""Actually I just heard about it.""

""All right,"" said Socrates, ""So you don't really know if it's true or not. Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about Diogenes something good?""

""No, on the contrary...""

""So,"" Socrates continued, ""You want to tell me something about Diogenes that may be bad, even though you're not certain it's true?""

The man shrugged, a little embarrassed. Socrates continued, ""You may still pass the test though, because there is a third filter, the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about Diogenes going to be useful to me?""

""No, not really.""

""Well,"" concluded Socrates, ""If what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me or anyone at all?""

The man was bewildered and ashamed. This is an example of why Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem.

It also explains why Socrates never found out that Diogenes was banging his wife.",,False,,t5_2qh72,False,,,True,t3_1ewlo1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1ewlo1/socrates_the_philosopher/,

Since he was a chief in a modern society, he had never been taught the old secrets. When he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the winter was going to be like.

Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he told his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.

But, being a practical leader, after several days, he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, 'Is the coming winter going to be cold?'

'It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,' the meteorologist at the weather service responded.

So the chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. 'Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?'

'Yes,' the man at National Weather Service again replied, 'it's going to be a very cold winter.'

The chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find.

Two weeks later, the chief called the National Weather Service again. 'Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?'

'Absolutely,' the man replied. 'It's looking more and more like it is going to be one of the coldest winters we've ever seen.'

'How can you be so sure?' the chief asked.

""And the score?""

""2-1."" 

""Who scored the winning goal?"" 

""Ian St. John"" said the old man, without a hint of hesitation.

The Liverpudlian was knocked out by this and told everyone back home about the Memory Man when he got back.

In the stream, a salmon was swimming, and it looked up and saw the fly. It thought to itself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, I'd be able to jump up, catch it, and I'd have myself something to eat.""

Alongside the stream, a bear was standing. The bear looked at the fly, and thought to itself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, that salmon would jump up to catch it, and I could jump out, snag that salmon, and I'd have myself something to eat.""

Across the stream, up a steep slope, a hunter was hidden in the brush. The hunter looked at the fly, and thought to himself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, that salmon would jump up to catch it, the bear would jump up to catch the salmon, and I could jump up, shoot the bear, and I'd have myself a new trophy.""

Hidden in the grass behind the hunter was a mouse. The mouse looked at the fly, and thought to itself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, the salmon would jump up to catch it, the bear would jump up to catch the salmon, the hunter would jump up to shoot the bear, the sandwich in the hunter's pocket would fall out, and I'd have myself something to eat.""

A bit higher up the slope, on a jutting rock, sat a pussy cat. The pussy cat looked down at the fly, and thought to itself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, the salmon would jump up to catch it, the bear would jump up to catch the salmon, the hunter would jump up to shoot the bear, the sandwich in the hunter's pocket would fall out, the mouse would hop over to get the sandwich, I could leap down on it, and I'd have myself something to eat.""

At that moment, the fly dropped down about a half an inch. The salmon leapt up and caught the fly, the bear leapt out and snagged the salmon, the hunter jumped up and shot the bear, the mouse hopped out and started to eat the hunter's sandwich, and the pussy cat leapt down to catch the mouse...but it missed. It rolled down the slope, and fell into the stream.

Moral of the Story: A lot of things have to happen to get a pussy wet.

After a while, he finds himself in a very nice neighborhood with big, stately residences...no pubs, no stores, no restaurants, and worst of all NO PUBLIC RESTROOMS.

He really, really has to go, after all those drinks. He finds a narrow side street, with high walls surrounding the adjacent buildings and decides to use the wall to solve his problem.

As he is unzipping, he is tapped on the shoulder by a London police officer, who says, ""I say, sir, you simply cannot do that here, you know.""

""I'm very sorry, officer,"" replies the tourist, ""but I really, really have to go, and I just can't find a public restroom.""

""Ah, yes,"" said the policeman.""Just follow me"". He leads the tourist down a back delivery alley to a gate, which he opens.

""In there,"" points the policeman. ""Go ahead sir, anywhere you like.""

The fellow enters and finds himself in the most beautiful garden he has ever seen. Manicured grass lawns, statuary, fountains, sculptured hedges, and huge beds of gorgeous flowers, all in perfect bloom.

Since he has the policeman's blessing, he relieves himself and feels much more comfortable. As he goes back through the gate, he says to the police officer, ""That was really decent of you... is that what you call English hospitality?""

I'll tell ya, my wife and I, we don't think alike. She donates money to the homeless, and I donate money to the topless!

One night I came home. I figured, let my wife come on. I'll play it cool. Let her make the first move. She went to Florida. 

I asked my old man if I could go ice-skating on the lake. He told me, ""Wait til it gets warmer.""

My doctor told me to watch my drinking. Now I drink in front of a mirror. I drink too much. Way too much. My doctor drew blood. He ran a tab.

When I was born the doctor came out to the waiting room and said to my father, ""I'm very sorry. We did everything we could...but he pulled through.""

I come from a stupid family. During the Civil War my great uncle fought for the west!

My father was stupid. He worked in a bank and they caught him stealing pens.

My mother had morning sickness after I was born.

My mother never breast fed me. She told me that she only liked me as a friend.

My father carries around the picture of the kid who came with his wallet.

When I played in the sandbox the cat kept covering me up.

I could tell that my parents hated me. My bath toys were a toaster and a radio.

One year they wanted to make me poster boy... for birth control.

I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent back a piece of my finger to my father. He said he wanted more proof.

My uncle's dying wish was to have me sitting on his lap. He was in the electric chair.

One time I went to a hotel. I asked the bellhop to handle my bag. He felt up my wife!

This morning when I put on my underwear I could hear the Fruit of the Loom guys laughing at me.

I'm a bad lover. Once I caught a peeping tom booing me.

My wife only has sex with me for a purpose. Last night she used me to time an egg.

It's tough to stay married. My wife kisses the dog on the lips, yet she won't drink from my glass!

My wife isn't very bright. The other day she was at the store, and just as she was heading for our car, someone stole it! I said, ""Did you see the guy that did it?"" She said, ""No, but I got the license plate.""

Last night my wife met me at the front door. She was wearing a sexy negligee. The only trouble was, she was coming home. 

A girl phoned me and said, ""Come on over. There's nobody home."" I went over. Nobody was home!

A hooker once told me she had a headache.

I went to a massage parlor. It was self service.

If it weren't for pick-pocketers, I'd have no sex life at all.

Once when I was lost I saw a policeman and asked him to help me find my parents. I said to him, ""Do you think we'll ever find them?"" He said, ""I don't know kid. There are so many places they can hide.""

I remember I was so depressed I was going to jump out a window on the tenth floor. They sent a priest up to talk to me. He said, ""On your mark...""

When my old man wanted sex, my mother would show him a picture of me.

I had a lot of pimples too. One day I fell asleep in a library. I woke up and a blind man was reading my face.

My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.

Last week my tie caught on fire. Some guy tried to put it out with an ax!

I met the surgeon general. He offered me a cigarette.

I was making love to this girl and she started crying. I said, ""Are you going to hate yourself in the morning?"" She said, ""No, I hate myself now.""

I knew a girl so ugly, they use her in prisons to cure sex offenders.

I knew a girl so ugly, I took her to the top of the Empire State building and planes started to attack her.

I knew a girl so ugly, the last time I saw a mouth like hers it had a hook on the end of it.

I knew a girl so ugly, she had a face like a saint--a Saint Bernard!

I was tired one night and I went to the bar to have a few drinks. The bartender asked me, ""What'll you have?"" I said, ""Surprise me."" He showed me a naked picture of my wife.

During sex my wife always wants to talk to me. Just the other night she called me from a hotel.

My marriage is on the rocks again. Yeah, my wife just broke up with her boyfriend.

One day as I came home early from work, I saw a guy jogging naked. I said to the guy, ""Hey buddy...why are you doing that for?"" He said, ""Because you came home early.""

I went to see my doctor... Doctor Vidi-boom-ba. Yeah...I told him once, ""Doctor, every morning when I get up and look in the mirror I feel like throwing up. What's wrong with me? He said, ""I don't know, but your eyesight is perfect.""

I told my dentist my teeth are going yellow. He told me to wear a brown necktie.

My psychiatrist told me I'm going crazy. I told him, ""If you don't mind, I'd like a second opinion."" He said, ""All right. You're ugly too!""

I was so ugly, my mother used to feed me with a slingshot!

When I was born the doctor took one look at my face, turned me over and said, ""Look, twins!""

And we were poor too. Why, if I wasn't born a boy, I'd have nothing to play with!

With my wife I don't get no respect. I made a toast on her birthday to 'the best woman a man ever had.' The waiter joined me.

I'm not a sexy guy. I went to a hooker. I dropped my pants. She dropped her price.

I tell you, I'm not a sexy guy. I was the centerfold for Playgirl magazine. The staples covered everything!

What a childhood I had, why, when I took my first step, my old man tripped me!

Last week I told my psychiatrist, ""I keep thinking about suicide."" He told me from now on I have to pay in advance.

I tell ya when I was a kid, all I knew was rejection. My yo-yo, it never came back! 

Oh, when I was a kid in show business I was poor. I used to go to orgies to eat the grapes.

When I was a kid I got no respect. The time I was kidnapped, and the kidnappers sent my parents a note they said, ""We want five thousand dollars or you'll see your kid again.""

I tell ya, my wife was never nice. On our first date, I asked her if I could give her a goodnight kiss on the cheek - she bent over!

I tell you, with my doctor, I don't get no respect. I told him, ""I've swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills."" He told me to have a few drinks and get some rest. 

Some dog I got too. We call him Egypt because he leaves a pyramid in every room.

With my dog I don't get no respect. He keeps barking at the front door. He don't want to go out. He wants me to leave.

What a dog I got. His favorite bone is in my arm!

He didn't even remember how he got home from the party. 

As bad as he as feeling, he wondered if he did something wrong.

Jack had to force himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he saw was couple of aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table.

And, next to them, a single red rose! Jack sat up and saw his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed. 

He looked around the room and saw that it was in perfect order, spotlessly clean. 

So was the rest of the house. He took the aspirins, and cringed when he saw a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror.

Then he noticed a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in lipstick: 

""Honey, breakfast is on the stove. I left early to get
groceries to make you your favorite dinner tonight. I love you, darling!""

He stumbled to the kitchen and sure enough, there was hot breakfast, steaming hot coffee and the morning newspaper. His son was also at the table, eating. 

Jack asked, ""Son, what happened last night?""

""Well, you came home after 3 A.M, drunk and out of your mind. You fell over the coffee table and broke it, and then you puked in the hallway, 
and got that black eye when you ran into the door.""

Confused, he asked his son, ""So, why is everything in such perfect order and so clean? I have a rose, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me??

His son replied, ""Oh THAT! Mum dragged you to the bathroom to clean you up, and when she tried to take your pants off, you screamed, 'Leave me alone bitch, I'm married!""

Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy birthday!"", and possibly have a present for me.

As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy birthday"".

I thought... well, that's marriage for you, but the kids will remember. My kids ate breakfast and didn't say a word.

So when I left for the office, I was feeling pretty low and somewhat despondent. 

As I walked into my office, my secretary, Jane said, ""Good morning boss, happy birthday!"" It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered.

I worked until one o'clock and then Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know,it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your birthday, let's go out to lunch, just you and me"".

I said, ""Thanks Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!

""We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. We dined instead at a little place with a private table. We had two martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day...We don't need to go back to the office, do we?""

I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?""

She said, ""Let's go to my apartment"".

After arriving at her apartment Jane turned to me and said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for a moment. I'll be right back"".

""OK"", I nervously replied.

She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake... followed by my wife, kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy Birthday"".

And I just sat there...

On the couch...

The town doesn’t have much money to take care of prisoners so the sheriff gets an idea.  He decides he’ll charge money to let the townspeople punish the crooks and use the money to keep them in jail for as long as he can.  The sheriff figures  even a short stay in jail will be plenty after a little “justice” from the townspeople.

The sheriff takes the criminals to the town square, handcuffs them posts and sets up shop.  He tells the people that the punishment should fit the crime so anyone can pay $1 to kick the rapist in the groin.  Since the con artist used his image to wrong his victims, anyone can pay $1 to hit him in the face.

After a while there are two long lines for the criminals.  Some people paying $5, $10, even $15 to get their licks in.  After a long while, a guy steps up for his turn and sees the con artist’s face is a bloody pulp and thinks “He’s so beat up at this point, he probably can’t even feel anything anymore.  I’m not going to waste my money on that.”  So the guy walks up and kicks the con artist squarely in the groin.

Harold is 95 and lives in a Senior Citizen Home. Every night after dinner, Harold goes to a secluded garden behind the Centre to sit and ponder his accomplishments and long life. 

One evening, Mildred, age 87, wanders into the garden. They begin to chat and before they know it, several hours have passed. 

After a short lull in their conversation, Harold turns to Mildred and asks, ""Do you know what I miss most of all?"" Sex!"" 

Mildred exclaims, ""Why you old fart! You couldn't get it up if I held a gun to your head!""

""I know,"" Harold says, ""but it would be nice if a woman could just hold it for a while.""

""Well, I can oblige,"" says Mildred, who unzips his trousers, removes his manhood and proceeds to hold it. Afterward, they agree to meet secretly each night in the garden where they would sit and talk and Mildred would hold Harold's manhood.

Then one night, Harold didn't show up at their usual meeting place. Alarmed, Mildred decided to find Harold to make sure that he was okay.

She walked around the Senior Citizen Home. She found him sitting by the pool with Ethel, another female resident, who was holding Harold's manhood.

Furious, Mildred yelled, ""You two-timing son of a bitch! What does Ethel have that I don't have?""

I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.

And as I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.

As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, “I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.”",,False,,t5_2qh72,False,,,True,t3_1coebi,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1coebi/i_played_for_a_homeless_mans_funeral/,

sons.  Early one morning, the woman awoke, and while looking out of
the window onto to the pasture, she saw that the family's only cow waslying dead in the field.  The situation looked hopeless to her -- how could she possibly continue to feed her family now?

In a depressed state of mind, she hung herself.  When the man awoke to find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to see the
hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in the head.

Now the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the
cow!), and he decided to go down to the river and drown himself.  When he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the bank.  She said, ""I've seen all and know the reason for your despair.  But if you will have sex with me five times in a row, I will restore your parents and the cow to you."" The son agreed to try, but after four times, he was simply unable to satisfy her again.  So the mermaid drowned him in the river.

Next the second oldest son woke up.  After discovering what had
happened, he too decided to throw himself into the river.  The mermaid said to him, ""If you will have sex with me ten times in a row, I will make everything right."" And while the son tried his best (seven
times!), it was not enough to satisfy the mermaid, so she drowned him
in the river.

The youngest son woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow in the field, and his brothers gone.  He decided that life was a hopeless prospect, and he went down to the river to throw himself in.  And there he also met the mermaid.  ""I have seen all that has happened, and I can make everything right if you will only have sex with me fifteen times in a row."" The young son replied, ""Is that all?  Why not twenty times in a row?"" The mermaid was somewhat taken aback by this request.  Then he said, ""Hell, why not twenty-five times in a row?"" And even as she was reluctantly agreeing to his request, he said, ""Why not THIRTY times in a row?""

Finally, she said, ""Enough!!  Okay, if you will have sex with me
thirty times in a row, then I will bring everybody back to perfect
health."" Then the young son asked, ""Wait!  How do I know that thirty

[The names of the friends are interchangeable, try using your own friends' names for added humor]

Three friends die and go to heaven. When they reach the Pearly Gates, St. Peter greets them, giving them the usual speel that everyone gets when they're about to enter, and as they are walking in he says "" By the way, I almost forgot the new rule. Whatever you do, don't step on a duck.""  The three friends think this is an odd rule, but they agree to it and step in. 

The second they enter they realize that the final rule might be harder to follow than they thought. Heaven is TEEMING with ducks!  Try as they might, they quickly realize that avoiding the birds is going to be a difficult task. And then it happens, ""QUACK!""  Friends Two and Three look over in shock as Friend One steps on a duck. Quickly, an angel rushes over with one of the most unattractive people the three of them have ever seen. ""Because you stepped on a duck, you are condemned to spend the rest of you time in the Kingdom shackled to this person. Have a good eternity.""  The angel shackles the two together and flies off. 

After seeing what happened to Friend One, the other two are more wary of the consequences and begin treading extremely lightly. The two of them make it another three days before, on the dawn of the fourth day, a loud ""QUACK"" is heard. Friend Two looks to Friend Three, wide-eyed, fearing the worst. The angel rushes over, ties Friend Two to a hideous being, and flies away. 

The third friend, now petrified that this will be his fate, becomes incredibly paranoid, barely walking anywhere. He lasts one week, two weeks, but on the beginning of the third week an angel brings one of the most stunningly beautiful people the friend has ever seen, shackles the two of them together, and flies off. Bewildered and excited, Friend Three proclaims, ""Wow!  What did I do to deserve this?""  And the person the friend is shackled to turns and replies ""I don't know what you did, but I stepped on a duck!""",,False,,t5_2qh72,1369918188.0,,,True,t3_1fb9yv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1fb9yv/three_friends_die_and_go_to_heaven/,

Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up on that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say,
""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday.""
I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.
My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said,
""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!""
It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.""
I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""
We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go.
She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table.
We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.
On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?""
I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?""
She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""
After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said,
""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""
""Okay,"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.
Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy birthday"".
And I just sat there...
On the couch...

The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, RayBan sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, ""If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?""

Bud looks at the man, who obviously is a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, ""Sure, why not?""

The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3 cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.

The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany ...

Within seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, receives a response.

Finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet printer, turns to the cowboy and says, ""You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.""

""That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,"" says Bud.

He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car.

Then Bud says to the young man, ""Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?""

The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, ""Okay, why not?""

""You're a Congressman for the U.S. Government"", says Bud.

He is not very good at his job, and he is also very greedy. Since his income does not meet his expenses, he decides to steal from his passengers' fares. At first he steals only a little. However, as he gets more and more greedy, he steals more and more. Eventually, he is caught. The company is furious. Once he has been tried and found guilty, the company asks for the death penalty. The court refuses choosing to banish him from the country instead. 

The man moves on to another country, certain that he can dedicate himself to a new life. However the only thing he really understands is operating trains, so before long, he is a train operater in this new country. Unfortunately, the old habits come back, and after a while, he starts stealing from the passengers' fairs again. Once again, he is eventually caught and taken back to trial. Once he is found guilty, the judge says he sees no hope for reform, since this is the second time the man has been caught doing this. Thus, the judge sentences the man to death. 

On the day of execution, the man is placed in the electric chair, and the chair is turned on. Much to the surprise of everyone there, the man is not even hurt.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

However, he knew of an experimental treatment that might work, if he were willing to take the risk. The treatment consisted of implanting muscle tissue from an elephant's trunk in the man's penis.

The man thought about it for a while. The thought of going through life without ever experiencing sex again was just too much for him to bear. So, with the assurance that there would be no cruelty or adverse effect on the elephant, the man decided to go for it. A few weeks after the operation, he was given the green light to use his newly renovated equipment.

As a result, he planned a romantic evening with his girlfriend and took her to one of the nicest restaurants in the city. She was leaning over the table in a low cut shirt, and sure enough he began to feel very uncomfortable. To release the pressure, he unzipped his fly. Suddenly his penis emerged from his pants, went to the top of the table, grabbed a roll, and retreated into his pants.

His girlfriend was stunned at first, but then with a sly smile on her face said: ""That was incredible. Can you do that again?""

party alone. He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued
and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed and there

took his costume and away he went.

The wife, after sleeping soundly for about an hour, woke without pain,
and as it was still early, decided to go to the party.

have some fun by watching her husband to see how he acted when she was
not with him.

So she joined the party and soon spotted her husband in his
costume, cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice ""chick""
he could and copping a little feel here and a little kiss there.

His wife went up to him and being a rather seductive babe herself, he
left his new partner high and dry and devoted his time to her.
She let him go as far as he wished, naturally, since he was her
husband. After more drinks he finally whispered a little proposition
in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and had
passionate intercourse in the back seat.
Just before unmasking at midnight, she slipped away and went home and
put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of
explanation he would make up for his outrageous behaviour.

kind of time he had. ""Oh, the same old thing. You know I never have a good

Ed was devastated, but begged St. Peter to send him to a farm near his home. The next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking and pecking the ground.

‘Not bad,’ replied Ed the hen, ‘but I have this strange feeling inside. Like I’m gonna explode!’

‘Never,’ said Ed.


‘Well, just relax and let it happen,’ says the rooster. ‘It’s no big deal.’

He did, and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg! He was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood. He soon laid another egg — his joy was overwhelming.

As I was about to tee off at the fourth hole I heard a voice say, three wood. I looked around and no one was behind me so I took my stance. Then once again I heard ..three wood. I looked down and there was a frog at the corner of the tee box, and he was telling me to use my three
wood. I thought it was stupid but I was playing so badly that I thought nothing could hurt me so I took out my three wood. It was a long par four, and I hit the ball straight 250 yards with that three wood. Since the frog seemed to be lucky I picked him up and took him along with me. At the next hole he told me to use my five iron. It was a par three and I got my first hole in one ever. I made a least a birdie on all the rest of the holes, and all I had to do was listen to that frog.

That night I took the frog to the casino in my hotel. We played Roulette. I put my money where the frog said and won on every spin of the wheel. After that I was tired so I went up to bed. I took the frog out of my pocket and put it on the dresser. Suddenly it looked at me and said, kiss me. Now I wasn't about to kiss a frog, but he said it again. So I kissed the frog and he turned into the most beautiful fourteen year old girl you have ever seen in your entire life. And that your honor is how that fourteen year old girl ended up in my hotel room.

All was well at first until Maggie took delivery of a 'woman's magazine and began to read things about sex. It soon became clear that she had never climaxed during sex and, according to her Grandmother, all Irish women are entitled to a climax once in a while.

To resolve the problem, Paddy and Maggie went to see the Veterinarian since there was no doctor within thirty miles who could be relied upon not to gossip. However, the Vet didn't have a clue about people. But he did recall during hot summers, his mother and father would fan a cow that was having difficulty breeding with a big towel. 
Apparently, this cooled her down and helped her to relax. So he recommended they hire a strong, young man to wave a big towel over them while they were having sex. This, the Vet said, should cause the young wife to cool down, relax and possibly achieve the sought after climax.

So the couple hired a strong young man from Dublin to wave a huge bath towel over them as the Vet suggested. After many efforts, Maggie still had not climaxed so they went back to the Vet who suggested she change partners and let the young man have a go while Paddy waved the big towel.

They tried it that night and Maggie went into wild, screaming, ear-splitting climaxes, one right after the other for about two and a half hours.

When it was over, Paddy looked down at the exhausted young man and said loudly: ""And dat, me auld son, is how ya wave a feckin' towel!""",,False,,t5_2qh72,False,,,True,t3_1g2byt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1g2byt/some_years_ago_in_a_small_coastal_irish_community/,

Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says “I don’t feel like it, I just want you to hold me.”

I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits.
She couldn’t decide which one to take so I told her we’d just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went onto the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.
Let me tell you…she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck.
I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn’t even know how to play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I said, “That’s fine, honey”.

Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, “I think this is all
dear, let’s go to the cashier”.

like it”.

She did not know the answer. And she was doubly on the spot because she had used up her 50/50 Lifeline and her Audience Poll Lifeline. All that remained was her Phone-a-Friend Lifeline, and the woman had hoped against hope that she would not have to use it.

But the contestant had no alternative. She called her friend and gave her the question and the four choices. The blonde responded unhesitatingly: ""That's easy. The answer is 'C' -- the cuckoo.""

The contestant had to make a decision and make it fast. She considered employing a reverse strategy and giving Regis any answer except the one that her friend had given her. And considering that her friend was a blonde, that would seem to be the logical thing to do. 

On the other hand, the blonde had responded with such confidence, such certitude, that the contestant could not help but be persuaded. 

Time was up. ""I need an answer,"" said Regis. 

Crossing her fingers, the contestant said, ""C) the cuckoo."" 

""Is that your final answer?"" asked Regis. 

""Yes, that is my final answer,"" she said, breaking into a sweat.

The distressed woman wailed, ""Are you sure?"" ""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet..

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.""

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on  in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.  The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew
that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch
them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his
colleague, Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor. Horatio
thought about this and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than
satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it.      

Without pause, Nick readily agreed to the scheme.

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little
bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the
itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal
Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen
that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this
type of itch, and that tests had shown that, among all of the citizens of the kingdom, 

only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their
chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he
put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on
the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was
eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and was hailed by the King and Queen
as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment
of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have
cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and
with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder
into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick . . .

The three things I would want... A great golf game,
All the money he ever needs, and a fantastic sex life.'

On the same hole, he again hits a bad drive into

And says shyly, 'It's OK.'

Just as they reached the first tee, a beautiful young blond woman carrying her bag of clubs approached them.

She explained that the member who brought her to the club for a round of golf had an emergency that called him away and asked the trio whether she could join them.

Naturally, the guys all agreed.

Smiling, the blonde thanked them and said, 'Look, fellows, I work in a topless bar as a dancer, so nothing shocks me anymore. If any of you want to smoke cigars, have a beer, bet, swear, tell off-color stories or do anything that you normally do when playing a round together, go ahead. But, I enjoy playing golf, consider myself pretty good at it, so don't try to coach me on how to play my shots.'

With that the guys agreed to relax and invited her to drive first.

All eyes were fastened on her shapely behind as she bent to place her ball on the tee. She then took her driver and hit the ball 270 yards down the middle, right in front of the green.

The father's mouth was agape. 'That was beautiful,' he said.

The blonde put her driver away and said, 'I really didn't get into it, and I faded it a little.'

After the three guys hit their drives and their second shots, the blonde took out an eight iron and lofted the ball within five feet of the hole. (She was closest to the pin.)

The son said, 'Damn, lady, you played that perfectly.'

The blonde frowned and said, 'It was a little weak, but even an easy seven would have been too much club. I've left a tricky little putt.' She then tapped in the five-footer for a birdie.

Having the honors, she drove first on the second hole, knocked the heck out of the ball, and it landed nearly 300 yards away smack in the middle of the fairway.

For the rest of the round the statuesque blonde continued to amaze the guys, quietly and methodically shooting for par or less on every hole.

When they arrived at the 18th green, the blond was three under par, and had a very nasty 
12-foot putt on an undulating green for a par.

She turned to the three guys and said, 'I really want to thank you all for not acting like a bunch of chauvinists and telling me what club to use or how to play a shot, but I need this putt for a 69 and I'd really like to break 70 on this course.

If any one of you can tell me how to make par on this hole I'll take him back to my apartment, pour some 35-year-old Single Malt Strath Mill Scotch in him, fix him a steak dinner and then show him a very good time the rest of the night.'

The yuppie son jumped at the thought! He strolled across the green, carefully eyeing the line of the putt and finally said, 'Honey, aim about 6 inches to the right of the hole and hit it firm. It will get over that little hump and break right into the cup.'

The father knelt down and sighted the putt using his putter as a plumb. 'Don't listen to the kid, darlin', you want to hit it softly 10 inches to the right and let it run left down that little hogback, so it falls into the cup.'

The old gray-haired grandfather walked over to the blonde's ball, picked it up and handed it to her and said, 'That's a gimme, sweetheart.'

Dear Walter,


I hope you can help me here. The other day, I set off for work leaving my husband in the house watching the TV as usual. I hadn't driven more than a mile down the road when the engine conked out and the car shuddered to a halt. I walked back home to get my husband's help.

When I got home I couldn't believe my eyes. He was in our bedroom with the neighbours daughter. I am 32, my husband is 34, and the neighbours daughter is 22. We have been married for ten years. When I confronted him, he broke down and admitted that they had been having an affair for the past 
six months.

I told him to stop or I would leave him. He was sacked from his job six months ago and he says he has been feeling increasingly depressed and worthless. I love him very much, but ever since I gave him the ultimatum he has become increasingly distant. He won't go to counselling and I'm afraid I can't get through to him anymore.

Can you please help?

Sincerely, Sheila

-------------------------------


Dear Sheila:

A car stalling after being driven a short distance can be caused by a variety of faults with the engine. Start by checking that there is no dirt in the fuel line. If it is clear, check the vacuum pipes and hoses on the intake manifold and also check all grounding wires. If none of these approaches solves the problem, it could be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the injectors.

I hope this helps.

A manager at Wal-Mart had the task of hiring someone to fill a job opening. After sorting through a stack of resumes he found four people who were equally qualified. He decided to call the four in and ask them only one question. Their answer would determine which of them would get the job.

The day came and as the four sat around the conference room table, the interviewer asked, 'What is the fastest thing you know of?'

The first man replied, 'A THOUGHT.' It just pops into your head. There's no warning.

'That's very good!' replied the interviewer. 'And, now you sir?', he asked the second man.

'Hmmm...let me see 'A blink! It comes and goes and you don't know that it ever happened. A BLINK is the fastest thing I know of.'

'Excellent!' said the interviewer. 'The blink of an eye, that's a very popular cliché for speed.' He then turned to the third man, who was contemplating his reply.

'Well, out at my dad's ranch, you step out of the house and on the wall there's a light switch. When you flip that switch, way out across the pasture the light on the barn comes on in less than an instant. 'Yep, TURNING ON A LIGHT is the fastest thing I can think of'.

The interviewer was very impressed with the third answer and thought he had found his man. 'It's hard to beat the speed of light,' he said.

Turning to BUBBA, the fourth and final man, the interviewer posed the same question.

Old Bubba replied, 'After hearing the previous three answers, it's obvious to me that the fastest thing known is DIARRHEA.'

'WHAT!?' said the interviewer, stunned by the response.

'Oh sure', said BUBBA. 'You see, the other day I wasn't feeling so good, and I ran for the bathroom, but before I could THINK, BLINK, or TURN ON THE LIGHT, I had already s**t my pants.'

BUBBA is now the new greeter at a Wal-Mart near you!

It was the mailman's last day on the job after 35 years of carrying the mail through all kinds of weather to the same neighborhood. When he arrived at the first house on his route he was greeted by the whole family there, who congratulated him and sent him on his way with a big gift envelope. At the second house they presented him with a box of fine cigars. The folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures.


At the fourth house he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful woman in a revealing negligee. She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door (which she closed behind him), and led him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced. When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. When he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup's bottom edge.


""All this was just too wonderful for words,"" he said, ""but what's the dollar for?"" ""Well,"" she said, ""last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you. I asked him what to give you."" He said, ""Screw him, give him a dollar."" The lady then said, ""The breakfast was my idea.""

A lady goes to her parish priest one day and tells him, ""Father, I have a problem. I have two female parrots but they only know how to say one thing.""


""What do they say?"" the priest inquired.


""They say, 'Hi, we're prostitutes. Do you want to have some fun?'"" the woman said embarrassingly.


""That's obscene!"" the priest exclaimed, ""I can see why you are embarrassed.""


He thought a minute and then said, ""You know, I may have a solution to this problem. I have two male parrots whom I have taught to pray and read the Bible. Bring your two parrots over to my house and we will put them in the cage with Francis and Job. My parrots can teach your parrots to praise and worship. I'm sure your parrots will stop saying that...that phrase in no time.""


""Thank you,"" the lady responded, ""this may very well be the solution.""


The next day, she brought her female parrots to the priest's house. As he ushered her in, she saw his two male parrots were inside their cage, holding their rosary beads and praying. Impressed, she walked over and placed her parrots in with them.


After just a couple of seconds, the female parrots exclaimed out in unison, ""Hi, we're prostitutes. Do you want to have some fun?""


There was a stunned silence. Finally, one male parrot looked over at the other male parrot and said, ""Put the beads away, Francis, our prayers have been answered!""

One fine day in Ireland, a guy is out golfing and gets up to the 16th hole. He tees up and cranks one. Unfortunately, it goes into the woods on the side of the fairway.


He goes looking for his ball and comes across this little guy with this huge knot on his head, and the golf ball lying right beside him. ""Goodness,"" says the golfer, and proceeds to revive the poor little guy.


Upon awaking, the little guy says, ""Well, you caught me fair and square. I am a leprechaun. I will grant you three wishes.""


The man says, ""I can't take anything from you, I""m just glad I didn""t hurt you too badly,"" and walks away.


Watching the golfer depart, the leprechaun thinks, ""Well, he was a nice enough guy, and he did catch me, so I have to do something for him. I'll give him the three things that I would want. I'll give him unlimited money, a great golf game, and a great sex life.""


Well, a year goes past (as they often do in jokes like this) and the same golfer is out golfing on the same course at the 16th hole. He gets up and hits one into the same woods and goes off looking for his ball. When he finds the ball he sees the same little guy and asks how he is doing.


The leprechaun says, ""I'm fine, and might I ask how your golf game is?""


The golfer says, ""It's great! I hit under par every time.""


The leprechaun says, ""I did that for you. And might I ask how your money is holding out?""


The golfer says, ""Well, now that you mention it, every time I put my hand in my pocket, I pull out a ten pound note.""


The leprechaun smiles and says, ""I did that for you. And might I ask how your sex life is?""


The golfer looks at him a little shyly and says, ""Well, maybe once or twice a week.""


The leprechaun is floored and stammers, ""Once or twice a week?!""


The golfer, a little embarrassed, looks at him and says, ""Well, that's not too bad for a Catholic priest in a small parish.""

A fellow bought a new Corvette and was out on an interstate for a nice evening drive. The top was down, the breeze was blowing through what was left of his hair and he decided to open her up. As the needle jumped up to 80 mph he suddenly saw a flashing red and blue light behind him.


""There ain't no way they can catch a Corvette,"" he thought to himself and opened her up further. The needle hit 90, 100, 130 and finally 150 with the light still behind him. ""What the hell am I doing?"" he thought and pulled over.


The cop came up to him, took his license without a word and examined it and the car. ""I've had a tough shift and this is my last pull over. I don't feel like more paperwork so if you can give me an excuse for your driving that I haven't heard before you can go!""


""Last week my wife ran off with a cop,"" the man said, ""and I was afraid you were trying to give her back!""


""Off you go,"" said the officer.

Little Johnny is constantly late for school and what's worse is that he always has a big lie explaining why. The teacher tells the principal that she has had it with his exaggerations. The principal tells her to send Johnny to him the next time he shows up late. He will tell Johnny a lie so big that he will never tell another one. Ever.


The next day, Johnny shows up two hours late. Johnny says, ""I was two hours early today so I had time to fish in the pond on my way to school. I caught a 17-pound trout and had to take it home. If I didn't clean it and freeze it, my mom would've been angry. That's why I'm so late"".


The teacher promptly takes him to the principal's office and explains the story to the principal.


The principal tells Johnny about his own trip to school that day. He says, ""I was walking to school through the park on the trail today when I heard something behind me. I turned around and was shocked to see a giant grizzly bear behind me. He was 24 feet tall and had 6-inch fangs. He was going to eat me, Johnny! Just then a little dog ran out from the bushes, jumped up and attacked the bear. The little dog killed the bear and then ate the whole bear right there in front of me. What do you think of that, Johnny?""


Johnny replies, ""Oh yeah, that's my dog Sparky. That's his third bear this week.""

A defendant was on trial for murder in Philadelphia. There was strong evidence indicating guilt, but there was no corpse. In the defense’s closing statement the lawyer, knowing that his client would probably be convicted, resorted to a trick.


""Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have a surprise for you all,"" the lawyer said as he looked at his watch. ""Within one minute, the person presumed dead in this case will walk into this courtroom.""
He looked toward the courtroom door. The jurors, somewhat stunned, all looked on eagerly. A minute passed. Nothing happened.


Finally the lawyer said, ""Actually, I made up the previous statement. But you all looked on with anticipation. I, therefore, put it to you that there is reasonable doubt in this case as to whether anyone was killed and insist that you return a verdict of not guilty.""


The jury, clearly confused, retired to deliberate. A few minutes later, the jury returned and pronounced a verdict of guilty.


""But how?"" inquired the lawyer. ""You must have had some doubt; I saw all of you stare at the door.""
Answered the jury foreman: ""Oh, we did look. But your client didn’t.""

The woman nodded and said, ""Son, go back to the butcher and tell him I have also had free bread, free milk, and free groceries for the last 16 years and watch the expression on his face!""

The young bride approached her awaiting husband on their wedding night and demanded $20 for their first love-making encounter. In his highly aroused state, he readily agreed.


This scenario was repeated each time they made love for the next 30 years, him thinking it was a cute way for her to buy new clothes, etc.


Arriving home around noon one day, she found her husband in a very drunken state. Over the next few minutes she heard of the ravages of financial ruin caused by corporate down sizing and it's effects on a 50 year old executive.


Calmly, she handed him a bank book showing deposits and interest for 12 years totaling nearly $1 million dollars. Pointing across the parking lot she gestured toward the local bank while handing him stock certificates worth nearly $2 million dollars and informing him that he was the largest stockholder in the bank. She told him that for 30 years she had charged him each time they had sex , and this was the result of her investments.


By now he was distraught and beating his head against the side of the car. She asked him why the disappointment at such good news and he replied, ""If I had known what you were doing, I would have given you all of my business!""

I knew just what

She wanted to do

Her skin so soft

Her legs so fine

I ran my fingers

Down her spine

I didn't know how

But I tried my best

I started by placing

My hands on her breast

I remember my fear

My fast beating heart

But slowly she spread

Her legs apart

And when I did it

I felt no shame

All at once

The white stuff came

At last it's finished

It's all over now

My first time ever

At milking a cow...

A couple who drove their car to K-Mart only to have their car breakdown in the parking lot. The man told his wife to carry on with the shopping while he fixed the car.


The wife returned later to see a small group of people near the car. On closer inspection she saw a pair of male legs protruding from under the chassis. Although the man was in shorts, his lack of underpants turned private parts into glaringly public ones.


Unable to stand the embarrassment she dutifully stepped forward and tucked everything back into place.
On regaining her feet she looked across the hood and found herself staring at her husband who was standing idly by.


The mechanic, however, had to have three stitches in his head.

A golfer stands over his tee shot for what seems an eternity to his partner. He looks up, looks down, measures the distance and figures the wind direction and speed. The longer he takes, the more his partner fidgets. Finally his exasperated partner says, ""What's taking so long? Hit the blasted ball.""
The guy answers, ""My wife is up there watching me from the clubhouse. I want to make this a perfect shot.""


""Forget it, man,"" the partner says. ""You'll never hit her from here.""

The Mafia was looking for a new man to make weekly collections from all the private businesses that they were ""protecting."" Feeling the heat from the police force, they decide to use a deaf and dumb person for this job. If he were to get caught, he wouldn't be able to communicate to the police what he was doing.


On his first week, the collector picks up over $40,000. He gets greedy, decides to keep the money and stashes it in a safe place. The Mafia soon realizes that their collection is late, and sends some of their hoods after the deaf and dumb collector.


The hoods find the collector and ask him where the money is. The deaf and dumb collector can't communicate with them, so the Mafia drags the guy to an interpreter.


The Mafia hood says to the interpreter, ""Ask him where da money is.""


The interpreter signs, ""Where's the money?""


The dumb man signs back, ""I don't know what you're talking about.""


The interpreter tells the hood, ""He says he doesn't know what you're talking about.""


The hood pulls out a .38 and places it in the ear of the dumb collector. ""Now ask him where the money is!""


The interpreter signs, ""Where is the money?


The deaf man signs back, ""The $40,000 is in a tree stump in Central Park.""


The interpreter says to the hood, ""He says he still doesn't know what you're talking about, and doesn't think you have the balls to pull the trigger.""

So, Donald Rumsfeld is briefing George Bush in the Oval Office.


""Oh and finally, sir, three Brazilian soldiers were killed in Iraq today.""


Bush goes pale, his jaw hanging open in stunned disbelief. He buries his
face in his hands, muttering ""My God...My God"".


""Mr. President,"" says Cheney, ""we lose soldiers all the time, and it's
terrible. But I've never seen you so upset. What's the matter?""


Bush looks up and says...""How many is a Brazilian?""

“No sir, I know nothing” replied one. “No sir, he didn’t leave any money with you.” said the other. The senior advisors left the room. The Senator opened his safe and gave the Governor his cash.

“I just wanted to know what kind of senior advisors I have. “ Replied the Senator.

I found the number and dialed it. 

A man answered, saying 'Hello.' 

I politely said, 
'This is Chris. Could I please speak with Robyn Carter?' 

Suddenly a manic voice yelled out in my ear 
'Get the right f***ing number!' 
And the phone was slammed down on me. 

I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude. 

When I tracked down Robyn's correct number to call her, 
I found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits. 

After hanging up with her, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again. 

When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled 'You're an asshole!' 
And hung up. 

I wrote his number down with the word 'asshole' next to it, 
And put it in my desk drawer. 

Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, 
I'd call him up and yell, 'You're an asshole!' 

It always cheered me up. 

When Caller ID was introduced, I thought my therapeutic 'asshole' calling would have to stop. 

So, I called his number and said, 'Hi, this is John Smith from the telephone company. 
I'm calling to see if you're familiar with our Caller ID Program?' 

He yelled 'NO!' And slammed down the phone. 

I quickly called him back and said, 'That's because you're an asshole!' 
And hung up. 

One day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. 

Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for. 

I hit the horn and yelled that I'd been waiting for that spot, but the idiot ignored me. 

I noticed a 'For Sale' sign in his back window, so I wrote down his number. 

A couple of days later, right after calling the first asshole (I had his number on speed dial) 
I thought that I'd better call the BMW asshole, too. 

I said, 'Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?' 

He said, 'Yes, it is.' 

I then asked, 'Can you tell me where I can see it?' 

He said, 'Yes, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd. , in Fairfax 
It's a yellow ranch style house And the car's parked right out in front.' 

I asked, 'What's your name?' 

He said, 'My name is Don Hansen.' 

I asked, 'When's a good time to catch you, Don?' 

He said, 'I'm home every evening after five.' 

I said, 'Listen, Don, can I tell you something?' 

He said, 'Yes?' 

I said, 'Don, you're an asshole!' 

Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too. 

Now, when I had a problem, I had two assholes to call. 

Then I came up with an idea... 

I called asshole #1. 

He said, 'Hello' 

I said, 'You're an asshole!' 
(But I didn't hang up.) 

He asked, 'Are you still there?' 

I said, 'Yeah!' 

He screamed, 'Stop calling me' 

I said, 'Make me.' 

He asked, 'Who are you?' 

I said, 'My name is Don Hansen.' 

He said, 'Yeah? Where do you live?' 

I said, 'Asshole, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd., in Fairfax, a yellow ranch style home and I have a black Beamer parked in front.' 

He said, 'I'm coming over right now, Don. 
And you had better start saying your prayers.' 

I said, 'Yeah, like I'm really scared, asshole,' and hung up. 

Then I called Asshole #2. 

He said, 'Hello?' 

I said, 'Hello, asshole,' 

He yelled, 'If I ever find out who you are...' 

I said, 'You'll what?' 

He exclaimed, 'I'll kick your ass' 

I answered, 'Well, asshole, here's your chance. 
I'm coming over right now.' 

Then I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I was on my way over to 34 Oaktree Blvd, in Fairfax, to kill my gay lover. 

Then I called Channel 7 News about the gang war going down in Oaktree Blvd in Fairfax .
I quickly got into my car and headed over to Fairfax . 

I got there just in time to watch two assholes beating the crap out of each other in front of six cop cars, an overhead news helicopter and surrounded by a news crew. 

NOW I feel much better.

They tee off at 1:00 and after 2 holes they catch up to a twosome of women.  The women are playing unbearably slowly.

After waiting nearly an hour to play a hole, the men discuss how to get around these slow-playing women.  They try yelling to them, to no avail.

When the men reach the 4th tee, a par 3, they wait another 30 minutes while one of the girls takes 10 shots to get out of a sand trap.  The boss says to his subordinate, ""I'm going to take a ride up there in the cart and ask if we can play through.""

The boss gets about 50 yards from the green and abruptly turns around and drives back to the tee.  The subordinate asks, ""What happened?  Why didn't you say anything to them?""

The boss says, ""I got about 50-60 yards away, and I could tell that the two women were my wife and my mistress.""

The subordinate says, ""We ain't got all day.  Let me go talk with them.""  So he drives up, gets about 50 yards away, and abruptly turns around.

When he gets back to the tee, he says, ""Unbelievable.  What a fucking coincidence.""",,False,,t5_2qh72,False,,,True,t3_17agcg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/17agcg/golf_with_the_boss/,
