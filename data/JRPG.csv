.

My name is Steve; I'm one of the creators of Nameless: the Hackers.  We're a group of 2.5 guys who quit our jobs, invested our life savings and worked on a JRPG full time!  

. 

It's always been my dream to create a JRPG.  I grew up with the classics such as Chrono Trigger, Earthbound, FF series, Phantasy Star, SoM, etc...
The story, the music, the characters; I was addicted and their influence is still apparent in my daily life.  

When I got an iPhone, I was excited.  Now I can play RPGs on the go without carrying another device.  However, as I downloaded a few, it was very apparent that something felt missing.  Though the games were ported, and working.  That's what it felt like, a straight port.  I realized how different the touchscreen felt compared to a controller.  It turned me off immediately from furthering my adventures!  And, these RPG games were also extremely expensive.  17 dollars?  That is just crazy.  Especially because I can barely play through it due to the controls.  It was just a negative experience for me.  A few games managed to do it well, such as ""The World Ends With You"", but a vast majority felt awkward.  Thus, my mission was set.

.

Make a JRPG with controls designed for touch and also take the opportunity to try something completely new.  

.

The game's theme is about living the life of an ""underground"" hacker for hire and all the craziness that ensues.  The game features a global conspiracy in present day and has references to current technology and cyberpunk elements.

1332448050.0,116,self.JRPG,r8ve4,DAE restarts the whole game because you stayed away from it for too long and can't remember the story?,124,8,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/r8ve4/dae_restarts_the_whole_game_because_you_stayed/,"I do that with any genre of gaming, but it happens much more frequently with JRPGs, since their stories are usually more emotionally driven, and if you don't remember the plot up to the point you came back you can't feel anything for the characters!

That's also a more serious problem with JRPGs since they're usually very long. I find myself wasting 30 hours of game progress because I don't want to continue without remembering what has happened before.

I did it with Persona 3. The first time I played it was during a vacation to another state on my cousin's PS2. I played almost half of the game in a week (fucking love this game). Eventually, I came back home and brought my save file with me.

The problem is, it took around 3 months for me to get the game for myself, and when I finally played it again I couldn't remember the story correctly! Of course, I still knew about the Dark Hour and the overall important points, but I had forgotten all the little details that make this game so great!

I couldn't do it, so I deleted my 50 hour save file and started the game again, and I'll be honest: I don't have any regrets! =D",,False,,t5_2quw1,False,,ness,True,t3_r8ve4,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/r8ve4/dae_restarts_the_whole_game_because_you_stayed/,

So this post began as just talking about Crimson Echoes and Flames of Eternity but blew up into every good CT ROM hack, enjoy! 

For those that don't know of these, back in the mid to late 2000's there was a major Chrono Trigger fan sequel called Crimson Echoes ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger:_Crimson_Echoes) &amp; [Chronopedia](http://chrono.wikia.com/wiki/Crimson_Echoes:Game) Summaries, [TV Tropes page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/CrimsonEchoes)). It was highly, highly anticipated to be the penultimate fan hack that would fill everyone's desire to a more direct sequel to CT than Chrono Cross was. However Square Enix sent a [cease and desist letter](http://www.destructoid.com/square-enix-shuts-down-chrono-fan-game-crimson-echoes-131702.phtml) three weeks before the official release of the project, much to the dismay of EVERYONE. Luckily just under two years later the 98% beta build was leaked on Emu Paradise!. For a summary:

&gt;Crimson Echoes takes place right after the events of Chrono Trigger in the year 1005 AD. It starts where Marle and Crono are discussing the big tomorrow. Marle drilling Crono's head not to sleep in. They kiss and make their way home. Crono (Still living with his mom) is yet again be force to awaken but this time by Marle.

&gt;Crono, Marle, and Lucca attend an important meeting at Guardia Castle between the nations of Guardia and Porre. Porre has grievances of some kind and some political mumbo jumbo goes on. After a suspicious encounter with the Porrean agents, our three heroes are caught in an unstable Time Gate generated by a Time Egg replica. They all share glimpses of events across time featuring their old friends, then find themselves greeted by Robo in the year 2305, who is assisting Belthasar in his hidden facility. And so the untold story of the eternally burning flames begins...

And for those who want to watch it, here's a [Crimson Echoes Playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSTpkMB9kNk).

After CE's cancellation another fan picked up the project and produced [Flames of Eternity](http://metronomeproject.blogspot.com/), which... has proven considerably controversial. The devs of CE were more than a little pissed that someone took their work and tried to complete it, and it does diverge from the original and has some spelling/grammar errors. That being said it is very complete and really just needs some polish. If you want a look at it, it's all up on [Let's Play Flames of Eternity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svMe2X9pAQs) on YouTube. It got to a very final build, RC7 which only had a few missing features to be added, namely:

* Expanded Mall in 2305
* More open 2305 AD Overworld Map
* This includes a 2305 AD Medina
* Being able to skip the introduction

But for what you are all really waiting for, a link to [the ips files to play the game yourself!](http://ge.tt/19yuW0k) 

**NOTE:** These are NOT ROM files. You will need to get a copy of the Chrono Trigger ROM to patch and play these. For your convenience, [How to Patch a ROM File](http://fantasyanime.com/patching). As for a Chrono Trigger ROM... you'll have to find that on your own, perhaps you can rip it from your own CT SNES cartridge!

Additionally there are several other ROM hacks which are worth exploring to various degrees which I have summaries below (Note I copied these summaries from another website which I won't link to since it has the SNES and NDS CT ROMs at the top). All of these are in the link with Crimson Echoes and Flames of Eternity. But first let us take a moment to mourn the loss of another CT Project [Chrono Trigger Resurrection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxxwZSafh3E) and [Preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuAkxoSFdSA).

Chrono Trigger: Prophet's Guile - YouTube [Playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HVqPqvrJVE)
&gt; Chrono Trigger: Prophet’s Guile is another extensive hack, and by the same people behind Crimson Echoes. This follows the story of Magus’s rise to power in the Kingdom of Zeal after arriving in 12000 B.C. thanks to the distortion at his lair. In his bid to stop Lavos at the Ocean Palace, Magus must gain the trust of Queen Zeal and abolish all opposition. It’s about two regular Chrono Trigger chapters long, and full of surprises. Click [here](http://i.imgur.com/aNynoXP.png) for some screen shots.

Chrono Trigger Retranslation
&gt;The Chrono Trigger Retranslation gives you a chance to experience Chrono Trigger in its purity. Every single line is properly translated. Nothing is left out, its 100% uncut. Everything (items, weapons, attacks, spells, espers, etc.) have their proper name. The original challenge is retained (US release was made easier). Various bugs have been corrected. In other words, this is ""Chrono Trigger : PERFECT Edition"".

Chrono Trigger Coliseum
&gt;This incredible hack installs a battle arena in 2300 A.D. Three ladders of monsters exist for three difficulties - easy, medium, or hard. The ladders can be ascended with either a full party or a single member from Crono's group fighting the battles; for each win, ""battle points"" are earned. These can be traded for high class items in the right of the coliseum. Cool huh? But it's important that you read the 'readme' before using it, as it explains important details.

Chrono Trigger Hard Type
&gt;Do you think Chrono Trigger is way too easy? Well then apply the Hard Type patch! Here's a segment of the Read Me: ""Basically, CT5 is a Hardtype patch for Chrono Trigger, which means that most of the enemies' stats have been hacked to make them harder to defeat. Also, the character stats have been lowered to a degree, so when you hit certain peak levels you will not be as powerful as you would be in the original version. One more thing I did to add more of a challenge to the game is remove most equipment from the characters, so your defense will not be very high at the beginning. The tradeoff is that you get more experience from battles, so you will have the chance to get to a high level early in the game.""

Chrono Trigger Spoof #1
&gt;This is a 'spoof patch'. Spoof patches are applied to English R0Ms as if you were applying an English patch to a Jap R0M. This patch replaces about half of the main dialogue with hilarious jokes. Important aspects of the storyline are still retained. Click [here](http://i.imgur.com/729Jgdj.gif) for some screen shots.

Chrono Trigger Spoof #2
&gt;This spoof replaces almost all of the dialogue in the beginning of the game with hilarious perverted jokes. Click [here](http://i.imgur.com/ZRifJaW.gif) for some screen shots.

The new trailer did recycle a lot of the new features included in the first trailer but there is so much more to be excited about. The opening hangar scene, the large modern city, the sense of scale as the main character walked through the city.

This is how this is going to work: in top level posts *only*, please list *one game at a time* and write a little something about it; a mini-review of sorts (mechanics, story, etc: why someone should play that game). Feel free to put multiple games per post, but separate them out. Bold the title by surrounding with \*\*

If someone has already written about a game, and you'd like to add additional information, please respond to that game's post and don't make another--duplicates will deleted (or moved to their proper place). 

As games are populated in this thread, I will add them to the master list in this post (which I've seeded with a bit). I will write a few descriptions of my own as an example. **Please feel free to write up descriptions of games already mentioned in the list if they don't have a write-up yet**.

Persona 4 was a huge exception. The story kept me hooked, the monster designs were unique and the voice acting was top notch. The comedic relief in the game actually made me laugh IRL and the sound track freaked me out in a good way at the right times. To this day I think this game is #1 in my books next to Chrono Trigger.

This was probably the first game in 5 years that I've finished start to end. Many games I trail off and get bored. After it finished, I felt as if I  parted ways with some good friends. Felt surreal.

Can anyone recommend any games that you feel had the same effect on you? I tried P3 but it just didn't hook me for some reason. Currently playing SMT: Devil Survivor 2 and it's pretty good, but the voice acting in P4 made me feel so much more attached to the characters.",,False,,t5_2quw1,1343194473.0,,whitemage,True,t3_x44uj,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/x44uj/just_finished_persona_4_i_felt_like_i_lost_my/,

1364799489.0,59,self.JRPG,1ber7z,FF XII is the epitome of the statistics portion of tabletop RPGs,81,22,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1ber7z/ff_xii_is_the_epitome_of_the_statistics_portion/,"Skyrim is just the imaginative role playing part of those tabletops. The comparison between Skyrim and XII is this: XII is the epitome of the statistical based tabletop role playing game. The math working behind the scenes is an RPG enthusiast's wet dream, for those addicted to character customization &amp; how your world is affected by formulas like the dice roll. The 1/2/4/8 drop rates and the like. A weapons-based customization system influenced from Vagrant Story and FFTA, I suppose Yasumi Matsuno loves this. Matsuno basically made XII how he would've liked Vagrant Story given the technology.

What XII champions in RPGs, Skyrim does the opposite: in simplifying stats, with technology finally available, Elder Scrolls re-interprets the table top RPG. Elder Scrolls and Bioware games drop you in a world and instruct you to break the rules and live in that world. XII on the other hand presents you a world filled with rules and a concrete setting like any other traditional FF, yet hidden within is a set of tools that allows a skilled, intuitive role playing fan to break those rules and bend the world to your characters' will. This in no way takes away from the depth of culture written into the game world. It is a quality game - quality at what it does, which is entirely unlike ""open-world"" and especially sandbox games. XII is a unique open-world. Mundanely described as half-opened, or to haters, half-assed open world. The story is still on rails but you can force the train off the tracks, miraculously without explodering the train cars or passengers within; again, it is one and only game where it's presentation of your character(s) in an open world doesn't detract from that world - it's wonderful atmosphere, qualities we love from FF, shine through like no other.

There are monsters in the game that will kill you in one hit if you choose to fight them. For example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex inexplicably located right outside the first town. But this is just an example of why the game is interesting. There is no way to kill the T-Rex at the start of the game. It’s a rather brilliant red herring, design-wise (not the least of all because he’s a T-Rex, a normally ferocious creature). See, the T-Rex’s life bar is displayed in green, which the instruction manual clearly tells the player means the enemy will not attack. That many players just go ahead and attack the T-Rex is indicative of their belief in common sense (a T-Rex is murderous — fight for your life) 

Gambits. This is where director Hiroyuki Ito shines most — in creating straightforward game concepts that eliminate waste. Ito saw a way to get rid of the tedium of role-playing games (heal when low on HP, attack, attack, attack, get hurt, heal again, attack, attack) by implementing a simple AI programming scheme. The dead simplicity of the AI programming scheme, however, rather violently lays bare the fact that RPGs are, generally, predictable and tedious. Yet people can’t get their heads around this. With Gambits turned on (and configured with just five minutes of commonsensical thought), battles go at least TWENTY TIMES more quickly than in any other RPG. Yet players feel betrayed. They say, ""I want to press buttons."" The player merely directs his party through an area, freezing the action when he sees fit to make adjustments on the battle plan (stronger enemies appear, et cetera). This alone should be enough to qualify XII as a ""video game.""

A snippet : ""Chrono Trigger &amp; Secret of Mana started off as the same project: A cutting edge collaboration with Akira Toriyama codenamed Maru Island that takes full advantage of the SNES CD-Add-on. Going in a direction different from the soon to be released Final Fantasy IV, This was to be an Action-RPG with the awesome “Obviously drawn by Akira Toriyama” graphics seen in Chrono Trigger. The CD-Rom Add-on was canceled, so they decided to revise the project into what is now Chrono Trigger.""

The next bullet point describes how the Action RPG elements were to be used in a separate game (Secret of Mana).

Well worth the two or three minute read.

A Cyberpunk Blade Runner (Deus Ex if you will) style feeling. It took the capital from FFVI (which was steam punk) made it a bit more cyber and modern and ran with it. The music was the best. From the feeling of an oppressive corrupt government to finding your way through the corrupt and crime filled slumps working as a resistances group. It had lots of steam, sparks, robots, computers, wires signs and kanji (Chinese characters) everywhere. It was great!

1332217563.0,46,self.JRPG,r4myo,/r/JRPG Game Ranking by Console Results!,50,4,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/r4myo/rjrpg_game_ranking_by_console_results/,"Hey.  Bet you guys thought I just took your juicy, delicious data and didn't plan on giving anything back.  Well here it is.  The number of people taking the poll finally leveled off and I'm confident that we got the opinion of almost everyone who was interested.

First, some statistics stuff.  According to this app I found (http://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm), there is a 95% chance that the true results for the /r/JRPG subreddit population are within 7% of the results of this survey population.  I haven't broken out the old statistics textbook to verify this, but it seems about right.  What this means to you is that you shouldn't sweat anything under a 7% difference.  For example, FFVII beat FFIX by about 2.5% when you only count the positive votes.  Don't get your panties in a wad and start raging about how much better IX was.  This poll statistically cannot guarantee accuracy to that degree.

Second, lessons for the future.  I think this was a pretty good success, but there is obviously room for improvement.  People want at least 5 options when responding instead of 3, and I think that is reasonable.  I'll make sure to incorporate it in the future.  Also, I realized that not everyone is aware of the official recommended games list, nor do they particularly care what is in it.  I'll hold a nomination thread next time so that people have the opportunity to add in games and correct cross-platform information.  Finally, I'll spend some more time polishing the survey.  It looks like I accidentally misspelled a few titles, and left some series grouped together while others were separated by installment.

Third, results!  At the bottom of this post I'll link the raw and manipulated data spreadsheets.  For those who don't want to open up any more tabs, I'll do my best to summarize the information below.  Take the overall rankings with a grain of salt, because the games were compared by platform and not necessarily against each other.

    Overall:
    Final Fantasy VII
    Chrono Trigger
    Final Fantasy IX
    Final Fantasy VI
    Final Fantasy VIII

    PS3:
    Valkyria Chrnoicles
    Disgaea 3
    Nier

    Eternal Sonata

Because my knowledge of video games is slightly outdated can you guys give me examples of other slightly outdated western RPGs and the main differences between them and JRPGs and we'll just throw in Adventure games also. Like I said, here are the boundaries in my mind but I'd like to know what other people think.

Adventure: Extensive exploration, item gathering, you become more powerful through acquiring better items, NO leveling, saving is optional depending on the game length (example Zeldal)

JRPG: Extensive exploration, item gathering, characters gain levels, battles are not real time (you give commands, characters execute commands), highly stylized

WRPG: a cross between to the two, focuses more on realism (thats all I got)",,False,,t5_2quw1,False,,,True,t3_l0zi6,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/l0zi6/dae_remember_when_jrpgs_were_just_rpgs/,
1372802439.0,41,self.JRPG,1hiy3t,State of JRPG in Japan,46,5,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1hiy3t/state_of_jrpg_in_japan/,"I've been seeing a lot of stuff about how JRPGs are a dying genre and while things might seem grim in the West, people forget about the market that most of these games are targeted and marketed for to begin with: Japan.

So here are some big differences in the Japanese game market to think about when discussing JRPGs.

Let's look at this article to highlight some points
http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ja&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fmantan-web.jp%2F2013%2F07%2F02%2F20130702dog00m200011000c.html&amp;act=url

1. This SHOULD seem obvious but JRPGs and Japanese games in general generally sell much better then WRPGs and other western titles. New Etrian Odyssey and the newest Atelier game (Escha &amp; Logy) outsold the Last of Us.

2. Due to tight living spaces, portable is King. The PSP is WAY WAY more popular in Japan. In fact, this article FROM TODAY states they can't meet demand for the PSP version of Toukiden. Also, Vita were selling out after the recent price drop and the bevy of new titles coming out for it so declaring it dead is silly.

3. Rentals, physical media, and used games are still huge in Japan. The article above is from Tsutaya, a rental chain much like Blockbuster. Except it's still a huge chain instead of slowly going out of business. Digital distribution is many years behind to the point that the maker of Bayonetta didn't even know about Valve. This is why Sony would have been crazy to follow Xbox One's (now dead) DRM model in their home country.

4. PC gaming in Japan is mostly eroge, doujin, stuff that no console would ever touch, and adventure/visual novels. Due to tight living spaces, many people don't even own PCs. Most use PCs mostly for work and have been using mobile devices for email long before smartphones. For example, Diablo 3 did NOT EVEN GET RELEASED in Japan likely due to poor sales of Diablo 2.
See http://kotaku.com/5977001/why-pc-gaming-is-still-niche-in-japan

So hopefully, this will highlight some differences that may make you think twice before declaring JRPGs are a dying genre. There are TONS of JRPGs coming out every year so obviously it's a profitable venture. How well it sells outside of Japan or whether the publisher even CARES about releasing it outside of Japan is a different matter entirely.",,False,,t5_2quw1,1372877816.0,,,True,t3_1hiy3t,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1hiy3t/state_of_jrpg_in_japan/,

I thought this might be a good place to post about my recently released freeware RPG, ""Love and War: Act I"". Here's a direct link: [Love and War](http://antioch.snow-fall.com/law/downloads/Law1.exe)

So, just what is ""Love and War""? Well, it's a JRPG made with RPG Maker 2000 that focuses on plot and character development. I've been working on it for what seems like forever (and possibly is), but I'm finally ready to push out the ""Complete"" version. It features fairly extensive use of voice acting, what was a truly exhaustive endeavor, but ultimately worth it, I do think! It also contains quite a few pieces of artwork for various picture cutscenes. The exact playing time probably depends on the player (whether you're someone who likes to talk to every NPC and read every book, or just get on with the main quest), but would probably clock in at around 15 hours, I believe. 


This post might be getting too long, or may be not long enough (ack!), so I'll just cut it here for now. If there are any questions, I'd be happy to answer them! I hope you enjoy, and I'd very much appreciate any feedback you might have. :)",,False,,t5_2quw1,False,,,True,t3_1hwk1d,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1hwk1d/love_and_war_my_rpg/,

I was approached by Adremeaux telling me that there was not a complete list nor a list at all, but if I wanted to start formating a list and put it up on the Wiki I could. [Here is the link to the incomplete list](http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/wiki/complete_list_of_jrpgs)

At first I thought this is going to be really hard and time consuming and kind of pushed it off. I am currently a collector of these types of games specializing mainly in the Playstation era and thought to myself that a list would be more than helpful. This list would help me keep track of not only what I have and what I do not have but what I have played and what I have not played yet. 


With this being said I am going to start actively start working on completing the list as of today. I will be starting with Playstation and working my way to completion. It will take a great deal of time to complete as there are quite a number of these and I am doing it on my free time which is limited. This will be a bare minimum of information 

What I want from the community:

I have added the title Alundra today as an example of the format that I will be using throughout the entire process. Title, Release Dates(JP,NA,EU), Developer, Publisher(JP,NA,EU), and Type. I currently have never done anything like this ever and it is my first attempt so I am asking the community their opinions. I would like to keep to basic information so that the user can research the game for themselves. Also if you already have a list from other systems that you would like to share with me that would be greatly appreciated. 

One question that I would like ask is: 
How are you able to line break in this format ? I want something like this.

* JP Release Date 
* NA Release Date 
* EU Release Date

These are to all be in the same cell without the bullets.

What are your opinions? What are your suggestions? 

Edit: Please Up Vote so that more can see this and express their opinions. Remember there is no Karma in self posts. Again thank you !


Edit 2: Actively working on it today take a look please. The one thing I am doing is putting the different names that the game receives in different regions. Do you think that is too much ? does it look cluttered ? Should I not included them ?

1365328373.0,34,self.JRPG,1buh1h,My thoughts on: Valkyria Chronicles [Discussion],40,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1buh1h/my_thoughts_on_valkyria_chronicles_discussion/,"So I've been on a binge lately to play the latest JRPGs, and one of the titles to come across my palette is the PS3 title Valkyria Chronicles. Before I delve into detail, let me preface this entire wall of text by saying I have not played any of the DLC, and have no immediate plans to do so.

I wanted to write my thoughts on some JRPGs in this subforum particularly for two main reasons. Firstly, gaming has been a large and dominant part of my life since before I was really even sentient. I'd be uncomfortable to say I'm extremely knowledgeable about gaming, but I'd deny that I don't know a thing or two about interpreting and thinking about them. Secondly, I was hoping for some honest and thoughtful feedback to my own opinions to help explore viewpoints on the game as a whole. So let's begin.

Gameplay:

Perhaps the most interesting concept of Valkyria Chronicles to me- and probably the biggest reason why I would consider this game successful, would be it's BLiTZ system. Games to me have always been about challenge; if the game refuses to engage you, as the player, on a mental  or emotional level, then it's usually not worth any reasonable investment of time.

Valkyria Chronicles is structured in such a way that constantly has you engaged in what is going on in the map. There's very little on the battlefield that is beyond the player's control outside of the enemy, your soldiers are all under your jurisdiction and it is entirely up to you to come up with the most efficient way to defeat the Imperials. The top-down overview of the map very clearly illustrates the point- you are a commander of soldiers, and you have to plot out your movements to engage and defeat the enemy in the smartest way possible. The turn based element of this game helps to slow down the pacing of the game- not everything has to be done immediately and therefore without forethought. Being given a reprieve from the battle gives the player a chance to breathe, sit down and consider their next move before proceeding. At the same time, it isn't simply chess with guns either- enemies on the map will respond to your movements and open fire if you are in their line of fire during your movement phase. This helps to maintain some tension in the battle, and it adds a little to my immersion on the battlefield- it would be hard for me to believe that the enemy would idly stare at you running about in the thick of combat without making some sort of attempt to stop you. It's a pleasant minor touch that I couldn't help but appreciate; it gives the opponent a chance to respond to you in a turn-based environment without stripping the player of his thinking time entirely.

The greatest failing of this system, however, is waiting for your opponent to make their move. I said that the player is constantly engaged in what's going on the map- but that's only true when you're actually playing the game. It's quite annoying waiting for your AI opponent to move, attack and use orders in real-time. In fact, in the time it took for the opponent to complete their phase of the battle, I had gone upstairs, grabbed a drink, used the toilet and returned with enough time to catch up on where they had moved. I don't think this would irk me if battles were short- but they're not. Some missions would take me up to an hour to complete, and half of that time was spent watching soldiers move around on the battlefield that aren't under my control. I really don't see any reason why they couldn't have added a speed-up or skip options, as it only takes one good glance at the map to understand what has changed and what hasn't. Making it an option also wouldn't deprive anybody the privilege of seeing it if they wanted to. It's somewhat disrupting to my experience to have to put the controller down and stop playing so the game can progress after every decision I make.

It is worth noting how laughably easy it was to break the entire experience. Alicia, when order boosted, can run through the entire Imperial army and take every bullet to the face without much fuss and snatch the enemy flag in the first turn in almost any mission. Her potentials allow her to cover the entire map, take essentially limitless crossfire damage, hit any target with a guarantee and dodge almost anything if they live long enough to return fire. It is up to the player if they wish to play in this manner, but there's very little incentive not to. Getting a good rank on a mission rewards you for cutting corners, and the tedious wait to make your moves again can be compelling to end things on the first turn and skip on through. I don't think any less of the game for it, but it was an issue that I found to be somewhat distracting from the game's playability. While I could battle through and rely on tactics as was intended, it's much simpler and much more rewarding to exploit Alicia. It seems almost like the game penalizes you for playing it as intended sometimes.

Story:

[The story in Valkyria Chronicles is another part of the experience that I felt succeeded in it's attempts to bring in the player. Though the subject matter is the much-explored topic of war, I feel as though it was handled with a lot of grace and maturity. There is no definitive good or bad side, and everyone has their own reasons for going to war. Human suffering isn't limited to only the Gallians, and I felt a very sharp pang of remorse when I watched the wounded Imperial soldier die under the care of Welkin and Alicia. Some of this experience seemed cheapened to me however, as the game stops to give the player something to ponder about, only to have them returning to shooting enemy soldiers in the face the next mission simply because they are standing in your way. It would have been nice to see if this experience would have any impact on the characters through the rest of the story, but it doesn't seem to be touched on again afterwards. I think a mission where the Imperial squad sneaks you through their lines without combat would have tied the message up a lot tidier than the way it was.](/spoiler)

[One other thing that crossed my mind was the issue of ragnite, which sparks the entire war. The Imperials invade Gallia to gain access to it's ragnite sources, but this is only touched upon briefly in the introduction. The importance of ragnite takes a backseat to the Valkyrur plot, and I felt it was a bit bizarre to have such a large issue- large enough to spark a massive continental war, be pushed aside in the manner that it was. By no means should it have been more prevalent than the Valkyrur plot, but I felt it should have been present at the very least.](/spoiler)

[While talking about the story of Valkyria Chronicles, it's hard not to talk about the characters that it comprises of. Every character has a distinguishably quirky personality without it ever being outright ridiculous. Welkin, Alicia, Rosie, Largo, Isara and Zaka are all characters that are easy to relate to and bring color to Squad 7's composition. They all have distinctly unique traits about them, but none of it ever came off as being unfitting or unbelievable to the setting- which is a balance that many storytellers struggle to strike many times. I would have been perfectly happy with just the main characters being interesting, but the entire recruitable roster for Squad 7 is comprised of characters just as colorful and interesting as any of the main cast. It's a bit of a shame then, really, not to have any of them be somewhat involved in the plot to some extent- and have the plot respond to how many soldiers you keep alive. Complaints aside, I thoroughly enjoyed every character of my squad, and it give me as the player some incentive to keep them alive. It makes it a lot easier to care if you're not handed cannon fodder, but rather unique, irreplaceable individuals with their own backgrounds and stories.](/spoiler)

[The story thoroughly hooked me, though there were some things about it that made me step back a bit- the biggest of them being the pacing. As much as I enjoyed the chapter-by-chapter arrangements, I felt it kept breaking the pacing up to the point where it was starting to push me away a little. The presentation of the story as a book gives the player a believable window into a world as an observer, but it was a bit jarring to be treated to that world for a minute at a time before you are yanked out and given a menu again. I really don't think it would have been too much effort then, simply to link together the little cutscenes and dialogue options, and divide them where appropriate. As nice as the storybook presentation is, and as well as it sets up the entire world, it starts to undermine itself as it forces you to navigate the story sequence by sequence, which is further broken up by long loading times.](/spoiler)

[The last part of the story I wanted to touch on was Isara's death. It shook me about as much as I would expect it to shake anyone playing Valkyria Chronicles with a degree of involvement, and I think it was a very pivotal and important event in developing Rosie as a character, and through her, the Darcsen racism issue. But I couldn't help but wonder, however, was why Welkin wasn't more prevalent in the cutscene where Isara is fatally shot. It seems like too much of the focus is on Rosie, who only just recently started to accept the idea of befriending her. While it's not a bad thing to give her some screentime to develop upon their relationship, it seemed a bit unbelievable to me that her brother and her existing relationship with him wasn't given more consideration before her character was killed off. She holds a brief discussion with Welkin discussing her wish to let him fly, and this element carries on in a meaningful way related to the story with the creation of the ISARA plane that rescues Welkin and Alicia, and their daughter being named in her memory. If this event was supposed to be so important to Welkin then, it was a bit questionable to present him as being so visibly unfazed. It seems a bit minor in hindsight, but it was somewhat disappointing to see how distant Welkin seemed at such a crucial moment in the plot, especially one concerning one of his most important relationships. It would have been nice to see a moment of weakness where Welkin is visibly shaken, and it would have given her death a little more importance if we could have seen how deeply it affected the star of the show. It wasn't handled poorly, but I feel a lot of the elements that are later integral to the plot would have had more meaning if Isara's death struck her brother a little harder than it did.](/spoiler)

Presentation:

Nobody could argue Valkyria Chronicle's presentation to be faulty. The unique and vibrant watercolor style breathes a sort of life into the game and it's world that makes it much more engaging to be a part of. I found myself drinking in much of the beautifully rendered world of Gallia during some cutscenes and missions, and it's hard to fault anything in the game for being sloppy or underpolished. 

The stylized approach to Valkyria Chronicles makes it incredibly pleasant to experience, and I think it will age incredibly well as a result. For comparison's sake, the second Modern Warfare game came out a year after Valkyria Chronicles- and since it is trying to emulate real life, it is naturally going to age much worse. Just recently I had booted it up, and the visuals seemed blurrier and worse off from what I had remembered, whereas this 2008 title continues to awe me 5 years later.

To tie together the presentation, the sound of the game seems to fit and meld with the world so well that playing the game muted feels almost jarringly unnatural. The sounds of gunfire, footsteps and tank engines rumbling help to piece together the environment, and the immaculate quality of the character lines made Squad 7's troops become much more colorful and interesting after you take them into combat, and hear their unique lines delivered with convincing personality. I played through Valkyria Chronicles with the Japanese dub because that is the version that the original developers intended to go with their writing, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well the English voices suited the characters as well. It just seemed like every design choice in the game's presentation was very deliberate and focused, which really ties together the entire atmosphere.

Overall:

The game was one of the most pleasant surprises I've had the honor of experiencing. While I do question some of the game's implementations, many of them are from a mechanical point of view, and the experience doesn't suffer from them enough to be turned away from it. There are so many aspects to it that I feel were just well-executed, but didn't touch on, such as the levelling and research system and the purchasable extra scenes. Including cutscenes, Valkyria Chronicles took me about 22 hours to complete all of it's gameplay and story. The last 5 missions were beat in a single turn though, and I have yet to watch all of the extra report scenes, so it's not hard to imagine that this game could extend past 25 or even into 30. With future replays and DLC, the dedicated could easily sink over three times of what I have so far.

Though my main concern with games of a hearty length is staleness, Valkyria Chronicles avoids that problem enough to keep the player intrigued from the title screen to the end credits. It's definitely a title that I would place very high on my list, and I have a deep amount of respect for how much the game is able to communicate to me, even if it does force me to sit through long periods of waiting. I've been hearing a lot of chatter about JRPGs declining in quality in recent years, but if titles like Valkyria Chronicles continue to come out onto the scene, I honestly would not give that concern a second thought. It's a real shame then, how much recognition this game deserves, but fails to attain.",,False,,t5_2quw1,1365330255.0,,sui6,True,t3_1buh1h,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1buh1h/my_thoughts_on_valkyria_chronicles_discussion/,

Now when you put the two of them on paper, 13-2 should have been better. 13-2 was basically Square saying ""We heard your complaints about FF13, and we fixed it in 13-2"", but why is it that I liked 13 better? 

I think the biggest element was that, although it was no longer linear like 13, the whole experience felt disjointed to me. A lot of times I would have no clue where to go, or why I was there and it felt like some areas had little relevance to them besides a grind. Look at Chrono Trigger, which did this right. *Every* single time had great relevance in the story. If you were missing *one* timeline, you would not have been able to complete the journey. There is 2300 A.D. which motivates Chrono to defeat lavos, 600 A.D. where you meet Melchior, the prehistoric times where you recover a ruby to restore the Masamune etc etc. In 13-2 you were absolutely overwhelmed with areas (that sometimes felt like copy pasted levels) that felt like it was just there just for the hell of it. I understand that they wanted a lot of content for the gamer, which is a good mindset by square, but it seemed like it was spread thin a little. What I think would have improved it was not giving *too* much freedom to the player. The advantage of a linear experience is that the developers are able personally plan out what they want the player to go through. Now *too* much linearity is also a bad thing (as seen with 13), so it would have been better if they tried to find a balance between the two. I hate to sound like a parrot, but a game that did this good was Chrono Trigger. You always knew where you needed to go and weren't absolutely overwhelmed with areas, but at the same time you can go into other times and explore, grind, or whatever you wanted to do.

The second is the weak and limited cast of characters. I think the strongest character was probably Noel, given his tragic background and his well done development, but it wasn't enough to carry the story. Look at FF13. You had Lightning, Snow, Sazh, Hope, Vanille, and Fang. As corny and melodramatic as they were, I actually loved them a lot. It felt like I was following the journey of a close-knit family, which I tend to prefer over solitary casts.

Lastly, the ""pokemon"" system in battle. The battles didn't feel as good because there was an absence of a third, real character. Now when you look at it from a purely mechanical view, it doesn't matter what character you use, but rather the ""numbers"" that they bring to the table. So for example. if Snow was a carbon copy of Fang, it would make no difference whatsoever which one you used in battle. But you would still prefer to use the character that you prefer in battle because well...you want to feel their presence in the battlefield. In 13-2 you had one creature in your battle that I personally didn't feel attached to at all. Yeah you can put little adornments on them and level them up, but that is not enough ""development"" for me to care for them.

Well that's basically it I guess. For those of you who played both of them, which one did you prefer?",,False,,t5_2quw1,1350953966.0,,,True,t3_11vbre,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/11vbre/why_i_had_more_fun_with_final_fantasy_13_than/,

There's nothing like the feeling of exploring a new place for the first time, and of course, obsessively chatting to every NPC in sight. Let's talk about games that really nail that down.

**Xenoblade Chronicles** innovates in producing the feeling of a living, breathing settlement. As NPCs each have their own schedules, you'll almost always find a new side quest or new dialogue each time you visit. And the affinity system means that talking to the town's inhabitants actually brings them closer together! The side quests unlock further quests so you're never left wanting for stuff to do. I'll never forget first exploring Frontier Village - so beautiful and serene, it really felt like a peaceful escape from the battles ahead.

**Grandia** had large, vibrant towns which were fun to explore. Rather than being simple diversions, each town had its own mystery and storyline that tied into the main quest, which fit perfectly with the game's sense of adventure. When you enter a new town in Grandia, you really have no idea what to expect.

I'll give an honourable mention to **Radiata Stories**. While its central city feels somewhat lonely due to a lack of dialogue, exploring it for the first time - and getting a sense of just how big it is - was really fun.

I'm writing a book about programming jRPGs but I'd also like to discuss the non-technical parts like plots.

In the past I've done Nanowrimo which, if you don't know, is a challenge to write a fiction book during November. One of the suggestions for coming up with a plot I found helpful was ""Write a one line plot, then expand to three lines and then expand each of those three lines and so on until you feel you can start"".

I thought that might be instructive to do in reverse for existing jRPG games. I know this smacks a little of   


&gt;  
&gt;""If you try and take a cat apart to see how it works, the first thing you have on your hands is a non-working cat."" - Douglas Adams
&gt;  



but it seems like a pretty good  way to get some idea of classic plot structures and see what reoccurring patterns spill out. I've done this for some of the first Final Fantasy games but I'd interested if people agree with my break down (and if they'd like to offer their own from other games that would be cool). I think the early Final Fantasy's are hard because the plots often veer perilously close to nonsense!

Even though these games are super old I've spoilered them as, at least in this subreddit, I imagine there are gamers who might want to play some of the older classic games but have not gotten around to it yet.

For those not already informed, when you buy Nintendo products now-days, the come with slips of paper that have codes on them which are worth points on club.nintendo.com. It's a sort of incentive program for buying new, since the slips can obviously only be used once. Each title will give you between 30 to 50 points or so, and you can take followup surveys that net you an additional 10 points. My WiiU Deluxe set got me around 200 points off the bat, so for me this game was essentially free.

The catch though is that it's still a Wii-only title, so if to redeem it on your WiiU, you'll have to boot into vWii mode, and download/play the game from there, and pay the $1.50 to upgrade the copy to a WiiU version whenever that becomes available.

**Radiant Historia:** By no means do I think this is bad game, I just didn't get into it as I found it boring. The art was great, music wasn't bad, story was good, time travel/decision making was excellent. However, I found the battles to be very monotonous. The system was okay, (knocking opponents into the same squares to accrue damage) but it was pretty much the same thing every battle. Maybe this game picks up later and I didn't get far enough, but I grew bored of it and stopped playing.

**Xenogears:** I can't really say much about this one because I played this when I was younger (maybe 16?) and all my friends loved it. I don't remember much of it, but I do remember that I didn't enjoy it. Who knows, maybe I was too stupid to get it back then.

1358356942.0,36,self.JRPG,16ozft,/r/JRPG Community notice about some new rules and clarifications,52,16,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/16ozft/rjrpg_community_notice_about_some_new_rules_and/,"As our community continues to grow at a rapid pace—nearly 10% growth *per month* according to our traffic logs—I'm seeing some types of threads that, while once welcome due to lower traffic, now seem to be clogging up the pipes a little bit. As such, I am going to be formally instating some new rules to help keep /r/JRPG a little more focused.

*****

### The following types of posts are no longer allowed and will be removed:

**1) Pictures of your game collections, or new games, or favorite games, screenshots of games, memes, humorous pictures, etc.**

Explanation: . /r/JRPG is a discussion forum, not an image board. I prefer this subreddit be focused on content and not pictures.As the sub continues to grow, I've been seeing more and more low effort pictures, and more importantly, a lot of copycat behavior, where one guy posts a picture of his games after no one had done so for a month, and then suddenly 6 identical threads pop up. In the past, I've kept the more established original and removed the copies, which I don't feel is particularly fair. In the interest of fairness, all posts of this nature will be removed in the future. ~~I hate to say this, but perhaps try your luck submitting these on /r/gaming, or maybe /r/finalfantasy which is much more image focused.~~ Try out /r/gamecollecting for these types of posts, or if you want to make a self post here and include the image inside of the post, however, that is perfectly acceptable. 

**2) Posts of the format ""I just started playing X, what should I keep in mind?"" Or, other posts asking specific gameplay questions about specific games.**

Explanation: This is actually the main reason I started this thread. I've removed no less than 7 of these threads in the past two days. /r/JRPG is a great resource for a lot of knowledgeable and passionate JRPG fans, however these types of threads will quickly weigh down this subreddit and cause it to lose its focus. I encourage all users considering threads like this to visit the game's forum at Gamefaqs, which will be able to provide answers. Those forums are still active for games topping 15 years old, and are a great resource for questions. 

Note: This rule doesn't affect *discussion* of individual games—ex. *Who thinks Delita was the real hero of Final Fantasy Tactics?*—only gameplay related queries. For newer releases, there will be [Now Playing](http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/qy00v/introducing_rjrpg_now_playing/) links along the top bar where it would be appropriate to ask gameplay questions.

**3) Asking for game recommendations**

Explanation: Many resources are available for game recommendations via the sidebar and even more [via the search function](http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/search?q=recommend&amp;restrict_sr=on). 

### The following types of posts should be self-limited in posting amount:

**1) Posting of personal streams is limited to once per two weeks.**

However, feel free to [add your stream to the new Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/wiki/index), along with any information you want to provide (i.e. *streaming JRPGs every Monday-Friday at 6pm EST*).

**2) Posting of content from your blog or website or Youtube account is encouraged, however please limit yourself to one post per week.** This rule is actually very old and is unchanged. Some of our best news and article posts come from our users, but is a dangerous path between a little self-promotion and Reddit becoming a free advertising platform for the site. This rule is designed as a middle-ground. 

### Inflammatory language:

The use of racist, sexist, or homophobic terms has a *one strike policy*. If you use such language in a comment, you will be immediately suspended for two weeks. Any further infractions will result in permanent ban. We have no need for that kind of language around here and encourage an environment of understanding and respect, not hate and/or childish lack of self control. 

*****

That's all for now. As always, /r/JRPG is a highly moderated subreddit with the intent to foster meaningful discussion and keep playpen antics out. Though we are all passionate about our opinions, personal attacks are not tolerated, and racial or homophobic slurs have a one strike policy. Thankfully we almost never have to institute that. 

*****

Oh, and **one more thing... [we have a new Wiki and you should be editing it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/wiki/index)** Yes, you. The wiki is available to all, and we'd love to make it a fantastic JRPG resource. Some page ideas are stubbed out in the index: feel free to take up arms and start writing those pages, or make your own pages, no approval needed! If you don't have wiki editing permissions due to the preset rules (120 days old account, 50 subreddit karma), send me a message and I will personally add you.

1352671360.0,36,self.JRPG,1311gn,"A Technical Analysis of the ""Super Mario RPG"" Game System",47,11,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1311gn/a_technical_analysis_of_the_super_mario_rpg_game/,"**Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars** was a game released by Square in 1996. The RPG system itself is fairly simplistic: it lacks any kind of ""skills"" such as Climb, Barter or Swim. Instead it focuses entirely upon combat for it's system resorting to dexterity games for the player to resolve any miscellaneous tests.

The data I used to analyze the system is, admittedly, a rather small sample size spanning the first seven (7) levels of the game. This covers a total of 18 enemy creatures five (5) of which I (subjectively) considered to be a boss or mini boss. A boss or mini boss was determined by the overall magnitude of the battle, and was usually distinct by their being dialog with the enemy before/during/after combat. The main player character, Mario, was also analyzed and used to compare to the enemies and bosses.

[Figure 1 - The Data](http://i.imgur.com/QEITg.png)

Boss monsters are highlighted in yellow.

**RPG SYSTEM BASICS**

The main system has four main character components:

* **Attack**
* **Defense**
* **Magic Attack**
* **Magic Defense**

Additionally, there are **Hit Points** which determine your characters overall life, and **Flower Points** which are essentially the same as the more commonly known Mana Points (or MP) which determines how many spells you can cast. Flower Points are increased by finding ""Flower Tabs"" throughout the game and *do not* increase through the normal leveling system; so they were left out of this analysis.

**EXPERIENCE POINTS**

As your character defeats monsters and challenges, he is rewarded with **Experience Points** which can allow Mario to attain a new **Level** once a certain amount has been reached.

[Figure 2 - Experience Points Needed vs Experience Points Given](http://i.imgur.com/w16FG.png)

As you can see in Figure 2 the amount of XP needed to attain a new level stair steps up while the overall payout from defeating monsters stays essentially the same. As expected Boss monsters give slightly more XP then normal enemies. Ideally, the amount of XP given would remain completely flat, as any rise would offset the stair step requirement of the level ladder.

**COMBAT - ATTACK**

A character's ""Attack Power"" is the amount of damage dealt to an enemy. Part of the damage is nullified each attack by an enemies ""Defense Power"", with the remainder reducing the enemies Hit Points.

&gt; For example, an Attack Power of 10 would deal 10 damage except if the enemy had 3 Defense in which case only 7 damage would get through.

There is a timing mechanism in the game in which if the player presses the controller button at a specific time during the attack they can increase the amount of damage dealt somewhere between 1.5-1.7x the normal rate. This amount is only a guess on my part as I don't have the exact numbers to pin a figure down.

[Figure 3 - Player Attack vs Enemy Attack](http://i.imgur.com/OLnOJ.png)

One of the hallmarks of many Japanese RPGs is the fact that the players deal much more damage then the enemies do; but in return the enemies have orders of magnitude higher Hit Points. Figure 3 compares the amount of damage a player can deal vs what the enemies and bosses can deal. Even the bosses are no match for what Mario can deliver!

You'll notice in Figure 3, as in the other examples a certain trend: The characters' stats climb linearly while the enemies tend to favor a more ""wave"" pattern. The Bosses stats tend to bloom upwards more in a stair step or bull curve fashion.

[Figure 4 - Player Magic Attack vs Enemy Magic Attack](http://i.imgur.com/PvtQv.png)

Looking at the Magical Attack abilities we once again see that the players tend to have the upper hand. Interestingly the Boss enemies did reign supreme for a short while. However this can be partially explained by the fact that the first spike is right about the time a second friendly character, Mallow, is introduced. Mario and Mallow are tasked with defeating a single enemy who is understandably more difficult then it's preprocessors.

**COMBAT - DEFENSE**

[Figure 5 - Player Defense vs Enemy Defense](http://i.imgur.com/AygMG.png)

Defense is the amount of damage that gets absorbed *before* it reduces the Hit Points of the receiving party. It's essentially ""armor"". In figure 5 we can see the players are no match even compared to the normal-leveled enemies. The enemies, especially the bosses, are designed to take a beating. It should be noted, however, that monsters do come in different strengths with some holding a lot of armor while others even less then the players themselves.

[Figure 6 - Player Magic Defense vs Enemy Magic Defense](http://i.imgur.com/cdwld.png)

Figure 6 tells a slightly different tail in which the competing parties are fairly even until after mid game when both Monsters and Bosses take the lead. This can be partially explained by the fact that in the opening of the game very little magic is used and so a defense for it is not required.

**HIT POINTS**

[Figure 7 - Player Hit Points vs Enemy Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/E9yhw.png)

This is where we see the trademark of Japanese-based RPGs. While the Player's hit points are about the same as the Monster's hit points; it's the Bosses that tend to have exponentially more HP. In Figure 7 you can see that while the player only has about 50 HP, the boss he faces has 500!

It should be noted that the saving grace to this runaway train is that right about the same time the Boss HP exploded was the same time a secondary character, Mallow, was introduced making the fight two-against-one. Also, note from Figure 3 &amp; 4 that the characters can deal more damage to an enemy then they receive. 

**ATTACK VS DEFENSE**

So far I've been comparing Apples to Apples. However, how do the dynamics work when a player character deals damage to an enemy? How much Defense is there in respect to the Attack power of the Player?

[Figure 8 - Player Attack vs Monster Defense &amp; Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/u3rF8.png)

Figure 8 describes a rather beautiful relationship between the amount of damage dealt vs the amount that can be absorbed. We see that the blue line (Player Attack) never dips below the red line (Monster Defense), lest the player would deal no damage!

As mentioned earlier the monster's stats tend to follow a wave pattern while the player characters favor a linear progression.

[Figure 9 - Player Attack vs Boss Defense &amp; Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/FhG8p.png)

Looking at how a player's attack rating stands against a Boss defense is once again dwarfed by the sheer scale of the Boss's Hit Point value.

**DEFENSE VS ATTACK**

[Figure 10 - Monster Attack vs Player Defense &amp; Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/AOFEQ.png)

Turning the tables we can look at how well a player character can take damage dealt by a monster. We see similar results as in Figure 8 where the blue line never dips below the red; which would cause the monster to deal no damage to the player!

[Figure 11 - Boss Attack vs Player Defense &amp; Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/BrmBk.png)

The results are a little more erratic when it comes to Bosses. It would seem, in fact, that a boss has all of it's damage nullified by the players armor between points 5 &amp; 6. This however is a bit misleading as the graph rendering software used in this analysis dipped the line lower then it should be in an attempt to ""smooth"" the lines. It is a close call though. Figure 1 will show that there is only a single point difference in favor of the Boss. A weak Boss if you ask me!

Please note that the results for magic attacks vs magic defenses (the player giving the attack) are, for all intents and purposes, the same as Figures 8-11. You can see the graphs [here](http://i.imgur.com/VJJuY.png) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/ggQo5.png).

**ATTACK VS MAGIC ATTACK**

[Figure 12 - Enemy Attack vs Enemy Magic Attack](http://i.imgur.com/OgAp6.png)

Looking at the progression of the game, it would make sense that normal attacks would be replaced with more powerful and verbose magic attacks. However, conventional wisdom would be wrong according to Figure 12. We see, instead, a dip in magic attacks by normal enemies. The sudden rise in use of magic attacks by bosses can not be taken without also noticing the rise in normal attacks as well.

It would seem, instead, that all the attacks are progressively getting stronger.

**DEFENSE VS MAGIC DEFENSE**

[Figure 13 - Enemy Defense vs Enemy Magic Defense](http://i.imgur.com/Pw5zN.png)

Counter to Figure 12, we see that as the game progresses (and the player characters gain more and more spells) an interest in Magic Defenses begins to blossom. For regular monsters, near the end of my analysis, there is a steep rise in magic defenses just as normal defenses take a dip. Bosses are more well-rounded and choose to increase both sets of defense.

**COINS REWARDED**

[Figure 14 - Coins Rewarded](http://i.imgur.com/eySSv.png)

Shifting gears a bit, we can compare the number of coins offered as a reward for defeating an enemy. Nothing too surprising here: Bosses offer a larger reward then normal Monsters. Curiously, the payout for defeating a regular Monster barely rises until the end (which can be attributed to one particularly difficult monster--""Pandorite"").

**OVERALL STRENGTH OF PLAYERS AND MONSTERS**

[Figure 15 - Player P/T Sum vs Enemy P/T Sum](http://i.imgur.com/qjuZx.png)

When we add up the total value for both forms of Attack and both forms of Defense (or as I like to call them ""Power"" and ""Toughness"") and purposefully exclude Hit Points, we can compare players, monsters and bosses in an ""arms race"" of sorts. The overall combat effectiveness tends to favor the players, though the bosses make their signature spike to the top for a bit.

[Figure 16 - Total Enemies Strength (Hit Points Omitted)](http://i.imgur.com/sii9h.png)

Figure 16 compares all of the enemies (monsters and bosses combined) in a measurement of who has more points allocated to the Attack and Defense slots. Croco, Mack, Pandorite and Belome (the right-most bar) are the clear heavyweights.

[Figure 17 - Total Enemies Strength](http://i.imgur.com/GIGo8.png)

Lastly, I added the Hit Points back into the match to see who among the enemies is the one with the most points *total*. The Bosses are the clear winners. Curiously Pandorite (the second from the right) stands amongst the giants which are exclusively all Bosses.

At the time I purchased it I had heard very little about the game.  Average reviews, no major advertising....  So for $14, I'm getting a time killer for 10 or so hours, right?

WRONG...     

After spending about 15 hours on the first playthrough I was blown away...  The voice acting is 2nd to none.  If this game would have had even a modicum of publicity it would have awards pouring out of it's ears for the voice acting alone.  The voice acting is actually quite better than many large budget blockbuster films.   

However, even while the first playthrough had me staring in disbelief as if Nier himself had just jumped out of the T.V. and pimp slapped my mother right in front of me, I was still emotionally ill prepared for the 2nd playthrough.  

The heartstrings that got pulled when I learned the stories behind the wolves and P-33 (don't worry, I'm not giving away any more than that) left me slackjawed and fighting back wet-eye.  

Quite simply, I've NEVER had a game draw me in more emotionally than Nier...  And I've been gaming since Breakout on the 2600.  I've played many, many, MANY games and this one....  this one takes the cake.  

So...  For those that either haven't played Nier...  or even worse, those that have played and beat it the first time through and never picked it up for the 2nd playthrough...  Just shame on you.  Go get this game now, or dust it off and knock out the remaining playthroughs. 

I know that I can't wait until I pick up the controller to start playthrough 3...

FYI....  For those that may be put-off on the idea of multiple playthroughs, the subsequent playthroughs of the game pick up at the ""break"" which is just a bit more than halfway through the game.  You can knock out the subsequent playthroughs in just a few hours if you stick with only the main story line.

I'm not rich, I don't own most of these games so not a recommendation but feel free to add some if you played them. Any corrections/additions appreciated.

How wrong was I. I am now nearly at the end of the 2nd episode (with Joshua) and the game has become SO much better, I am enjoying the styles of missions more and more interesting stuff is happening. 

I always thought it was OK, but now that I see how much more there is to it that I thought, well, its an amazing game and the story has grown on me a lot. (Neku is still a bit of a miserable cunt though. Which JRPG lead character isnt though?)

This game was a predecessor to the SaGa games IN A SENSE in which instead of just being a long quest, became chapter-run games like SaGa Frontier 1 &amp; 2 but this is not of the same universe. Yes, the SaGa series started in 1989 but the gameplay was changed by Live A Live's gameplay. It was one of if not the first games to utilize a chapter system where each chapter is a different story entirely but relate. Each chapter is a different character and plays differently.

The battle system is entirely unlike any rpg - characters and enemies are on a 7x7 grid and attacks have a tactical rpg-esque method of attacking where certain squares can be attacked on based on the attack chosen. You are free to move as you like, but attacks are turn-based. Think if FF and FFT had some sort of bastard child. Also I believe this is the shortest RPG I have ever played, so it's a great pick-me-up if you're bored of something.

I'd post a youtube but all the ones I can find are spoilery, sans the one that plays in the title sequence:

Aside from the other bad-ish ending where Magus tries to save her, loses and erases his memory, are there any more ending bits that elaborate on this sub-plot?](/spoiler)

[Also, After a bit, the animated ending kicks in showing different characters and what not. At one point, in the mideavil period, it shows a green-haired warrior being knighted. Is this Frog/Glenn transformed back to human? Does it explain how? Also, it shows Lucca finding a baby under a tree with a pendant. Is this Crono and Marle's child? What gives?](/spoiler)

[One more thing: Only two endings have the extra anime scenes right? The good one that I described, and the bad one, that's super short?](/spoiler)

Finally, I kept hearing how some stuff was added in the DS version to make the story connect more with Chrono Cross's plot. But I guess this went over my head. Can anyone point out/explain what they were?

Thanks.

EDIT: Just wanted to add that I'm blown away at how efficient this game feels compared to some of the more contemporary RPGs. It has an interesting and coherent plot, mini-games, and a really good number of fulfilling sidequests without feeling messy or bloated.

1353619364.0,29,self.JRPG,13my28,My impression of Persona 4,39,10,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/13my28/my_impression_of_persona_4/,"So I've been hearing left and right about how awesome Persona 4 was, so I decided to check it out. I'm about 20 hours in so I can't talk about end game or anything like that, these are just some of my impressions of the game.

* It has an awesome premise. I haven't played any of the other Personas so this is the first real exposure to the idea of Personas that I have gotten. Using the other sides of yourself to help you in combat? Awesome.

* The story is very intriguing. The classic mystery ""formula"" is something that I've never seen used in an JRPG (anything to this degree anyway). It really helps to get into the character's mindset because like you, they have no fucking clue is going on. It's a great feeling when you think that you figure something out, only to have that theory crushed and going back to step one to see if you missed something. I'm genuinely interested in figuring out who is killing people and for what reason. They also do a good job of pacing it. It's not like they throw it at you constantly. They let you do your daily grind and social linking, but at the same time kind of nudge you and go ""hey remember people are getting murdered in our town? Maybe we should get to that"".

* Dungeon crawling. Probably my least favorite part of the game. It's nothing wrong with the Persona 4 dungeon crawling I suppose, I am just not a fan of randomly generated dungeon. It feels so artificial and repetitive to me. Yeah it's awesome that they try to keep it varied by adding a mini boss and having the monster become stronger at higher levels, but it's not enough for me. In the end, it's just running through the same hallways 11 times and finally getting to the boss, which I understand is the appeal to some people. Again, it's not anything wrong with Persona 4, I just personally don't like dungeon crawling.

* The social aspect of it...it's awesome. I love just getting to know these characters and developing my own character so that I can further interact with others. Most of the time I don't even care if that I gained a social link level with a character, I cared more for the fact that they opened up to me and I was able to learn a little bit about them. The leveling didn't feel like some artificial ""You are closer to this person because you are level 7 with them"", it felt more like ""you are closer to this person because you know *x* about them.""

* The music. I haev to say, Persona 4 has some of the most unqie music that I've heard in an JRPG. Catchy songs with acual lyrics playing in the background, even during battle? Awesome. Although I ended up hating the songs that played in the dungeons beacuse well...you're listening to the same track that loops for like 3 hours, but they were still good nonetheless. On top of that, the music is actually very fitting and appropriate to the atmosphere of the game.

[Personally one of my favorite tracks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kInTNibjXSE&amp;list=PLewQmI19gxbqWPyFF0VXRlzPR0o5-ua_l&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video)

* Graphiacally it's nothing special because I mean..it's the PS2. In this modern age of gaming, the standards are constantly getting higher so there is nothing we can do about it. It is however, aesthetically pleasing. The TV world has a really distinct and creepy vibe to it that actually seems like you're in a differnt world. The dungeons look awesome in that they are themed according to the hidden persona of the characters, but again get a little tiring to look at after awhile. ONe of my favorite things actually, however stupid it may sound, is the smoothe interface. Every single time that I go into the menu screen, everything just seems so sleek and....yellow.

So overall, even though I am only 20 hours into the game, it has become one of my favorite JRPGs. ",,False,,t5_2quw1,False,,,True,t3_13my28,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/13my28/my_impression_of_persona_4/,

(Possible Spoilers),35,5,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/128yrj/what_are_your_top_5_rpg_towns_and_why_possible/,"I love RPG Towns. They are the resting spot in between story and dungeon segments. They are a way for designers to showcase the game world and really flesh it out. There you can talk to every NPC and learn all sorts of useless gossip or helpful hints. They have some of the best music of gaming in general. They're where you want to relax and just smile. Without them, I don't think an RPG would be the same.

List your top 5 towns and give some reasons as to why you chose then. Would you like to live there, do you like the music, what happens in the story, do you like the art? Please mark potential major spoilers :).

My top 5, in no particular order:

The Kingdom of Zeal(Enhasa in particular) from Chrono Trigger:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsj5xjoLXtE

Wow. Is all I have to say. The cities are almost ethereal. The outdoor environments are mesmerizing to watch as the waterfalls flow off down into the clouds. It invokes a dream-like atmosphere to which you're not sure whether to be drawn to or worried about when you learn about the darker nature of the kingdom of Zeal. Regardless, it's is an incredibly beautiful area that invokes great memories for me.

Gregminster from Suikoden 1&amp;2
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCME4Wxvj4k

Where it all began for me. The music at first is just stunning with the statue as a fountain first standing out. Going around shopping and learning new stuff from NPCs. Eventually meeting Windy and Viktor..
The icing on the cake was visiting and exploring it in Suikoden 2. I was so excited when that happened that I spent an hour just checking every cranny and nook and every npc to see how it related to the original game.

Hometown from Breath of Fire 2:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqoofJNA6k

Nothing that special here. I really love this theme primarily because I can recall Breath of Fire 2 being the first RPG that I really got into and played with my father. Hometown is a generic RPG town, but it's pretty interesting in how you gain access to various parts of it throughout the story and it helps develop the story.

Tazmilly Village from Mother 3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-P1HnqR8wE

This town stands out to me as one of the most dynamic in JRPGs. It changes throughout the story due to various story developments. At the start, even the most minor of NPC's has their own name and personality and it's fairly involving when you follow them and how they develop throughout the events of the story.

Arni Village from Chrono Cross
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8ILhJCr60A
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9y8l0KBUFs

Out of all the towns that I've listed, this is the one I'd like to live in the most I think. A relaxing coastal village that focuses on fishing, babysitting children, and a sweet looking bar. The music and the stories told here really do bring a lot of narrative to the game and make you wonder about how our choices really effect us in the future.",,False,,t5_2quw1,False,,mother3,True,t3_128yrj,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/128yrj/what_are_your_top_5_rpg_towns_and_why_possible/,

They're just two command prompt programs that I made back in the day when I was teaching myself programming, so it's nothing amazing but I think they're quite useful.  Instead of searching through a bunch of faqs for the tiny little blip of information you want, you can type in the name of the skill/command you're interested in and have a bunch of info about it thrown all in your face.

In the Jeanne d'Arc one, you input the name of a skill stone and receive info and stats about the stone as well as potential skillbinding combinations for it.

In the KH:BBS one, you input the name of a command and receive all possible ways to meld that command.  Then if one formula interests you, you enter its corresponding number to get more information about that formula.

1350318617.0,29,self.JRPG,11imvq,Had a chance to play the Ni no Kuni demo at NY Comic Con this weekend. Here are my thoughts. ,39,10,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/11imvq/had_a_chance_to_play_the_ni_no_kuni_demo_at_ny/,"There was a booth set up at Comic Con this weekend with two stations hosting a Ni no Kuni demo, with two different scenarios and a 10 minute time limit. The first scenario was an overworld setup (yes, this game has an old-school world map!) that seemed to focus on regular battles, and the second scenario was in a city and had a bunch of story and only a big boss battle, no regular fights. I played the entirety of the city scenario and 5 minutes of the world map.

First off, the game is stunningly gorgeous. The cel shading and standard 3D elements blend together perfectly, and the game really is as rich as a real Miyazaki world. Graphics are crisp and colors are bright and pure.

I skipped all of the story as, being on a tight time limit, I didn't really care to read dialog cut from the middle of the game when I have no idea what the general story setup really is. 

The battle system was really the core of the demo. My initial thoughts are that it feels a lot like FF 12's fighting engine. You have up to 3 party members in your group, and each of those members has an additional two monsters under their command. So, you've got 9 fighters on the field, and everyone is acting with their own AI besides whichever character you are currently controlling.

You can switch your control at will, and then choose from the basic options from there: attack, block, skill, item, etc. Regular human characters seem to have a much wider variety of abilities and usage than their pet counterparts, who I think were limited to only attack, defend, and one or two spells.

The boss fight was fast and frenetic, and perhaps a bit hard to tell what was going on. I managed to win with ease (after all 3 players ahead of me failed), but my strategy was little more than firing off a spell then switching out to another character and repeating. I stayed on top of healing and just used abilities and that was about it.

Regular world-map fights were so simple I hardly had to do anything. The fights basically won themselves.

I think there is more complexity than I was able to see. You can move freely on the battlefield, but I couldn't tell if this actually had strategic usage or not. I'm hoping that switching characters and controlling monsters affords more tactical options than I realized, playing with a manual or tutorial or even control guide. 

There was nothing in the demo showing any kind of regular menu screen, where you control equipment and your monsters and the like. I'm hopeful it was merely disabled for the demo and not actually just not there. 

Overall, it was a fun demo, and quite cheeky in the copy—the boss was a giant mechanical boar and there were endless pig puns in his attack names and the like; har har—so I have high hopes for the non-combat portion of it. I'm a tad worried that the combat is going to play itself, or just otherwise feel very repetitive, but I guess until I play a full release it will be hard to say how simple or complex it actually is. Did anyone else try the demo or have had a chance to play the Japanese version?

Initial reactions...",35,4,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/uxx1v/just_began_playing_tales_of_vesperia_my_first/,"For years, I've heard that the Tales series was one of the best.  Having been a fan of JRPG's since the heydays of Squaresoft titles on the SNES, I've glanced at the case a few times in passing but never really gave it true consideration.  Every time I'd look at it I just couldn't get past the art style.  It was unlike anything that I'd really seen in a game before and I was sure it would bother me...

Oh boy, was I completely WRONG.  
 
From the opening scenes and music, I was IMMEDIATELY hooked.  I don't mean, ""Oh this is cute, it'll grow on me"".  I'm talking tri-hook straight through the cheek, you ain't gettin rid of me.. HOOKED.  
 
Something about the music complemented the graphics perfectly.  It felt almost 80's style cartoonish.  There was an immediate sense of bewilderment that I haven't experienced in a game since I was 11 years old.  (Final Fantasy II on SNES)  

And that's just the intro...  

I'm only 2 hours into the game and the voice acting is incredible.  I've already developed that ""bond"" with Yuri that most games take dozens of hours to create.  I'm already facepalming at some of the things that Estelle says.  As for Repede...  A dog carrying a pipe?!?  How can you NOT love that?!  

Combat is a bit tricky.  I keep wanting to hit RT to block so I'm taking more damage than I really should.  I'm still learning how to string attacks together and blocking in between.  My go-to attack is still b,b,b,b,a.  I'm sure there's a point where combat just clicks, but it's still rough around the edges for me.  

I can tell there is a big focus on crafting in this game.  At least I hope there is, as I've always been a big fan of crafting in RPG's.  It seems that I'm constantly finding materials whether through combat or gathering points.  I have not yet gotten to the point of figuring out what to do with all these materials (and foods) but I'm excited to get there!   

Well, sorry to bore everyone, but just thought I'd post my initial reactions to Tales of Vesperia and see what others thought about the game.  (PLEASE NO SPOILERS)  I know it's considered a must-play by most so I expect that the majority of you will say it's a great game.  Just figured I'd open up a topic to give us something to chat about =)  

EDIT:  I also wanted to include the little conversations that pop up from time to time also.  They add so much flavor to the game.  I'm sure those are what have allowed the characters to take on their own personas so much earlier in Tales than in other RPG's.  They don't feel like filler, they feel genuine and relevant.  I know that I look forward to listening to them every time I get the queue on screen.

One problem with that JRPGs is that they are not very well understood by a lot of people. Many people have played FF7 - whether they've played JRPGs or not, so it's easy to give someone suggestions if that's what they like.

But we know differently. We know every little subgenre of game - we can tell the major differences between all the series, big and small. We can go into detail about a minor change in gameplay (Tales of Symphonia vs. Tales of the Abyss for example) that seems identical to the gamer of another genre.

Why is this bad? Well, most review sites or discussions are written... not for JRPG players. Someone who might be really *excited* about some obscure feature being added to Disgaea 4 that was missing before - something that would go completely unnoticed by most reviewers of the game.

I'd like to create a website that essentially lists every JRPG (just this sort of list would be beneficial to the fan) but also has detailed reviews, comparisons, comments, etc. that would be useful to someone considering a purchase or play.

What I would like from you wonderful folks at r/jrpg is the following: First, how would you want this to function? What sort of criteria do you want to see? What sort options are good? And second: Would you use this website? Does another similar website already exist that you use?

It's a project I would like to take on because I think it will spread the love for the JRPG around. It'll help new players get into the genre as well as seasoned vets find the next game to play. It'll be communal - that's for sure. Reviews, comments, ratings would all be needed. I'm unsure how to do this too - can anyone rate things? Write reviews? Staff members only? Some sort of permission system? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

It's just so sad to see a beautiful game trashed in reviews all over just because no one understands why we love JRPGs. But on the other hand, some JRPGs are so bad - you want people to avoid them. We have our lists on the sidebar, and they are good, but I want more. I'm hoping to make lists like these a reality that can be easily come by. But I can't do it alone - I need brainstorming help. Then I can work on the actual site design and development, and then I'll need more help (staff and all that) eventually. And I think this is the perfect place to find that help.

Sorry for the somewhat messy post - I've been writing term papers all day and am sort of out of it on the writing side. But I've been kicking this idea around for a while now and I'd love to hear r/jrpg's opinions before I start (and before I forget my plans!)",,False,,t5_2quw1,False,,,True,t3_istbh,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/istbh/rotten_tomatoes_for_jrpgs_good_idea/,

Not that I let reviews always dictate my buying decisions but in this case, there was a lot on the line (the price of a ps3).

A few years later now and I'm playing it after a stint with FFXII and I've gotta say that I'm halfway through the story of the first game (The disc comes with both) and I am blown away by how good it is. I will admit that after trying it for the first time, I wasn't particularly impressed and a little overloaded with the combat system/gameplay. I thought the story was kind of lame. The other night though, I threw it on and I've been playing it non-stop all weekend. The story is actually pretty good and the gameplay is just really fun. The fact that there's this fairly big online community similar to an MMO still playing regularly tells me that this is a game that I really should have gotten on board with sooner.

Ironically, I had the same experience prior with FFXII. I didn't like it my first attempt with it and then I fell in love with it. 

Also note that I realize White Knight Chronicles was revamped for the sequel (which is the version I own) so maybe that's a case where the game did suck and I just got the good version after.

So needless to say video games have been pretty big to me, and in particular the classic style RPGs of old. One of the things I try to do is remember the names of the people who made those games happen. When I was younger the only names I could really grasp were the composers, what I consider the ""holy trinity"", Nobuo Uematsu, Yasunori Mitsuda and Motoi Sakuraba. Eventually names like Koji Kondo, Yoko Shimomura and more recently, Masashi Hamamuzu have joined them up there in my brain. Game music is a big thing for me, so composers are too.

More recently though I've become more interested in some of the other folks too, in particular as I get a better understanding and appreciation for what exactly each person is responsible for in a game. Artists Tetsuya Nomura and Yoshitaka Amano are in there, and Akira Toriyama as well. Then there are the thinkers and such... Guys like Horonobu Sakaguchi, Yuji Horii, Motomu Toriyama, Yoshinori Kitase, etc.

Almost all of these names are guys who have been around for a really long time, and are probably recognizable to a lot of people. Recently though I stumbled upon a name that I recall seeing before, but never really registered, Hiroyuki Ito. So I took a look at Wikipedia, and lo and behold, this guy's resume is ridiculous.

* He directed Final Fantasy 6 and 9, two of the best received games in the series. He also directed 12, which was well reviewed but not very successful in the west.
* He created the original concept for not only FF7's Materia system, but also FF8's Triple Triad card game
* ""Main battle planner"" on Final Fantasy Tactics. Not quite sure what exactly that means, but sounds good to me
* Battle designer for FF4, FF5, FF6, FF7, FF8, FF9 and FF12

That's some incredibly impressive stuff. So, if there is anyone else out there who cares, Hiroyuki Ito is definitely a name to remember.",,False,,t5_2quw1,False,,dq1,True,t3_vvwp4,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/vvwp4/hiroyuki_ito/,

To me this sounds like a wonderful idea, as it would more easily enable co-operative play (+ DM) and would be a great way to get some of my friends who are not as into video games as I am into some of my favorite JRPGs.

In order to accomplish this, we would need teams of people to document in detail the damage/battle and progression systems in each game as well as crucial dialogue, shop contents, etc. This should be easy through emulators/savestates. The maps obviously can vary in exact layout as long as they work the same stylistically.

To qualify as tabletop, ideally the games would be playable with a (possibly very long) manual/guidebook (distributed in both PDF for printing and eBook formats), calculator, and dice (or random number generator on the calculator). No computer access should be required.

To make this easiest, I would advise that we begin with a series that has relatively simple battle mechanics (Final Fantasy IV-VI, for example) and do one series at a time rather than tackling all at once in order to maintain a kind of collective focus and format within the project. Possible series to attack include, but are not limited to, Tales, Final Fantasy, Persona, Megaten, and Dragon Quest.

With P5 in development, what should the series keep and what should be axed?

My thoughts: 
KEEP 
-Social Links (duh)
-Turn based battle system (although an ARPG would be cool, Tales of/ Ys 7 has a really good party system)
-Fast (menu) travel from P4/P3P
-""Special"" outfits
-Shoji Meguro OST
-Skill cards ( a la P3P)
-Unique dungeons (like in P4 - Tartarus was very atmospheric, but P4 was great)
-SHUFFLE TIME!

GO
-High school setting: 5 games showed they could mix this theme up well, but I'm curious to see what they could do with something else. Maybe college?
-Having to reselect fusions multiple times to get the skills you want - Devil Survivor let you pick skill inheritances and it worked out fine, IMO

ADD
-Special moves, unique to each character. If you hit a lot of weaknesses, the bar goes up, hitting strengths makes it go down. For the protagonist, the special is based off the Persona's Arcana.
-Party buffs: each member provides a support effect when in the main party. In terms of P4, Kanji provides a Strength boost, Chie increases critical hit %, Teddie increases item drops or something...idk.

Two months ago I started playing Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean for the second time (did not finish it the first time, corrupted memcard). For those who don't know about this game, it is famous to be one of the best JRPG on the Gamecube, with a very original card-based battle system and a very nice aesthetic. It is unfortunately also famous because of its horrible english dubbing, to a point where a lot of people actually played the game with voices disabled because it sucked too much. No undubbed version of the game existed as of two months ago, most likely because nobody worked enough on it to figure out everything needed for the undub.

It happens that I like reverse engineering games (trying to understand how they work, etc.) and I also wanted to hear how much better the Japanese voices sound :) So two months later, today, I finally finished the undub and tested it with a full playthrough of the game. There are still a few very minor issues that I did not bother to fix (for example, after a 1h boss fight and a 30min long cutscene, a single voice do not match the subtitle...) but apart from these there should be no problems.

I tested the undubbed version on emulator only but there is no reason it would not work on a modded Wii. Try it!

## Hard, legal version to get the undub

Using a modded Wii, dump the two discs of the US version and the two discs of the JP version. Then use [the tools I released](http://code.delroth.net/bk-undub/) to create the undubbed version from these four discs (warning: the tools require you to use Cygwin/Linux and are not done for end users, more for programmers).

## Easy, illegal way to get the undub

I know that some people illegally uploaded an undubbed version created using my tools. I do not condone downloading that, but that's your choice to do.

Have fun with this game, and merry christmas to you all!",,False,,t5_2quw1,False,,,True,t3_nq7rj,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/nq7rj/my_christmas_present_to_rjrpg_undubbed_version_of/,

Whether that happens on a next-gen system (unlikely) or the 3DS, I don't mind; I just want to play through that game again and hear a new remix of all those iconic tunes.  

I think this game has the best soundtrack of them all (just listen to the entire last boss track, all 4 levels, and say different), and the best cast of characters.  The story is simpler, perhaps, than some of the more ambitious later titles, but it works nearly perfectly as it is.

So, you might or might not have noticed I have a link to my stream on the side bar with Final Fantasy 7 on there. I have since completed that on stream and have also completed Final Fantasy 6 on stream. The next game I will be playing, starting Dec 6th @ 6 PM EST, is Suikoden II!

I have posted here before, a number of months ago, when I began working on an LP for Suikoden II. Well, because of real life and losing all my data, that was never completed. I love Suikoden II and really hope you will stick around and watch my streams and interact! So here are some questions you might have that I will hopefully answer:

**How can I watch your stream?** A couple ways. [Here is a link directly to my stream](http://twitch.tv/overstockretro). Thanks to Adremeaux, you can also find a link on the side bar as well.

**How often do you stream?** This answer really varies. I try to stream about 5 days a week but my schedule when I stream changes because of what is going on with real life.

**How can I know when you start streaming?** To not spam /r/JRPG this will be the only post showing when I am streaming. There are multiple ways to know when I will stream:

[You can subscribe to my YouTube where I update the feed with my plans](https://www.youtube.com/user/OverStockRetro?feature=mhee)

[You can like my Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/OverstockRetroStream)

[You can also make an account at twitch.tv and follow my stream](http://twitch.tv/overstockretro) This is one of the easiest as it will give you an email when I go live and you can find me easier on the twitch website

**Will you be getting all the stars?** Yes, I will be obtaining all 108 Stars of Destiny in game. I will not be doing the Clive sidequest though.

**Will you load Suikoden 1 data?** Because I do not have a capture card and cannot play my hard copy of the game, I am playing an emulated version and have been unable to find memory card data with the Suikoden 1 data. I have found some Suikoden 1 saves but not in the format I need. Hopefully I can find one tonight and show off what happens when you load Suikoden 1 data.

**Why should I watch your stream?** I aim to interact with the people watching me and having a good time in stream. I am 27 so I am not a nasally 14 year old and I strive to also give my experiences and knowledge about the game into the streams. I am certainly not perfect but I really enjoy having people in chat and having a good time.

**How long do you stream?** I usually only stream for 2 hours per night. The only time I stream longer, if I do, is on the weekend when I have more time. I upload my streams (which because of an update, I can upload the full length) to my YouTube where you can also catch up.

Whew, that was longer than I expected. Anyway, I hope you'll check out my streams and come say hi and interact with me/other viewers! If you have any questions about the game or anything, I'm at work for most of the day and can answer you here.

TL;DR I'm streaming Suikoden II starting tonight at 6PM EST. [Link to my stream](http://twitch.tv/overstockretro) &lt;3

Edit: I forgot one other way to find my streams. If you subscribe to /r/vgstreams I post each day when I will be going live with plenty of notice ahead of time.

You should also check out that r/ if you want to see other streams from people! It's still new and small but growing and I've tried to bring about discussion to help people there.

I not sure, but I believe the game has been recently launched in Arcade version in Japan. The console versions are already confirmed for the PS3 and 360. I still don't know if the fighting community is finding the game to be good or not, but judging by the fact that Arc Systems made the core mechanics, it's a given it's at least a good game.

Alright, now read this:

Report link:
http://gonintendo.com/?mode=viewstory&amp;id=174215

Now, since Atlus made a partnership with Arc Systems to make a fighting game out of Persona 4, it definitely wouldn't be strange if Arc Systems asked Atlus to make a JRPG out of Blazblue. Of course, that is only a single comment from the producer, which is VERY far away from a concrete plan to make the game, but anyway, I love to dream! =D

I'm not sure if you guys have ever played Blazblue (BB, for short), but I like fighting games a lot, and BB is my favorite one. Besides having an extremely well design core mechanic and a balanced rooster of characters, the BB series, unlike any other fighting game I know out there, has something that would be of great importance in the development of a JRPG: story.

Blazblue is the only fighting game I know with a genuinely good plot. The game has betrayal, vengeance, mystery, and all these great elements that make a good story well fit together. Personally, I'd be really happy to see another partnership from these two companies, but this time to make a Blazblue JRPG!

I pre-ordered the collectors edition from NIS America's website as soon as it was available. Usually NIS America takes a pretty long time to ship things out, I did not receive my Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory until a week or more after its release date. This was not the case for Time and Eternity, I received it the next day. It was even packaged in a box with bubble rap around it, I was very surprised about this because I am used to Amazon's bubble mailer that they send everything out in (I received SMT:4 in a bubble mailer, luckily it was not damaged at all). How was your shipping experience ? 

**Collectors content:**

* Time and Eternity Limited Edition box
* Time and Eternity for PS3
* Full-color hardcover art book
* Time and Eternity original soundtrack with jewel case
* ""Double Vision"" tear-resistant poster
* Limited Edition $64.99

I was impressed on how much we received for so little of a price. Most collectors editions are around $80-$100 for the same content that we received at a $65 price. Do you think this was a fair price? Were the contents to your liking, what could they have added to make it better?


**Thoughts about the game:**

I had heard very little good things about this game and it was making me rethink my decision about buying it, but I held my ground and went through with the purchase anyway. It has taken me some time to get to the game with the release of The Last of Us just a month before hand (Might I add, if you have not at least taken a look into that game I think you should). I started the game out with very little expectations because of all the negative responses the game has been receiving. I am currently only seven or so hours into it and I am enjoying myself greatly. The game reminds me so much of an Anime that I hardly feel like I am playing a game at times. I think the reasoning behind this has to do a lot with the art style and the comedy that they integrate into the story. With that being said the story is not perfect, its about a princess that can control time and has two souls that are trapped in one body. At the start of the game she is about to be married and her fiancee is killed at the alter, we do not know why this is happening nor does she. This is where the story starts, she uses her powers to go 6 months back in time to find out who is planning an attack on her wedding.

The one thing that I enjoy about the game the most is the main characters duel souls, Toki and Towa. In my experience while playing Toki seems more of a innocent loving character and in battle she has more power via ranged. Towa on the other hand is completely different she is more of a bad ass character and seems more powerful via close range. Every time you level up you switch souls, which makes up for the lack of playable characters that are in this game. When one character levels up the other character will level up also, which cuts out a lot of grinding. 

**The battle system:**

One word can describe the battle system; Easy! The game in itself is not hard at all so if you are looking for something challenging then I would probably stay away from this one. [Here is a video that describes the battle system, keep in mind it is not mine.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JkODYBKQUc) There are a few complaints about the battle system and here they are. Magic and melee are so uneven it is unreal, at times I feel like it is not worth using melee but you have to in order to build up your SP so you can use magic. In result I am spamming my melee as fast as I can in order to be able to use magic, because so far magic has killed everything in one hit. Another thing that I find bothersome is the fact that the enemies give you little to no time to attack, they are constantly attacking and at times I feel like I am guarding or dogging the entire fight. The also adds some kind of active battle system into the game because you are constantly taking damage and giving out damage, making it seem like a real fight. Monster variety is another thing that this game lacks, they pretty much took the same enemies and re-skinned them different colors named them something else and adjusted there stats and attacks. Also when you are finished with a battle there is a pause of black screen that is bout 2 seconds long and very noticeable when returning to exploration. What are some of your dislikes and likes about the battle system ? 

**Exploration:**


I was kind of disappointed in this, the reason is because everything is spelled out for you from every side quest to every chest on the map. Each side quest will give you the starting location when it becomes available with a blue question mark it will also give you the location to where to complete the side quest on the map. Every chest is located on the map with a star so there really is no need to explore in this game. You have a map of every place that you visit as soon as you start out so its just a matter of going from each star and each side quest and then running to complete them. Do you like this kind of thing ? What could they have done to change this and make it better ? 

**Final thoughts:**

All and all this game is really easy, but somehow I am enjoying it. I think this would be a really easy game to pick up and play and complete in a short amount of time. With the game being as easy as it is it seems like it is almost geared toward beginning JRPG payers. The game is not perfect at all and could use a lot of work,  but over all it is not as bad as people are making it out to be.Sometimes it is nice to just sit down and play an easier JRPG for a change. What do you enjoy most about the game ? What do you not enjoy about the game? What could they have done to fix some of the problems that you see in the game ? What are some of the problem the game has ? I just want to know your thoughts and opinions about the game now that you have sat down and played a little bit of it or maybe even completed it.

Comments, questions, praise, criticism, and all general discussion are welcome.

-----

*Fire Emblem: Awakening offers a unique blend of in-battle strategy, vast character customization, and 3-D cinematic graphics that appeal to a wide range of gamers. In this fantasy adventure for the Nintendo 3DS, you have the power to turn the tides of battle in an epic war against a dark dragon. Your fire-breathing foe threatens to destroy the entire empire with help from his armies of the undead. But, with your loyal crew of fighters, you could be the one to stop him for good.*

*In this game, you’ll join Chrom, brother to Ylisse’s empress and commander of its forces, in a fantasy world teetering on the brink of war. It’s your duty to guide a team of Ylisse’s finest soldiers - knights, mages, archers, and more - against the marauding Plegian bandits. To succeed, you will need to carefully choose the units you take into battle. As you lead your team through battles across maps that span entire kingdoms, your army will grow. Some characters are willing to join you quickly, while others may need more persuasion. Each character earns experience in battle, leveling up and gaining strength and abilities as they do so. It’s up to you to guide their moves, choose their weapons, and direct their attacks.*

*Create your own customized soldier and join a massive cast of interesting characters who all have their own stories to tell. Heighten your power on the battlefield by strengthening the bonds between your troops and even enlisting a friend of your own. Plus, with StreetPass and SpotPass options, you can access new items, characters, and maps.*

*Fire Emblem: Awakening* was developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo

Warning: it takes a VERY powerful machine.

I'm running an i7 860 OC'ed @ 3.8GHz and I have about 5-10% headroom on the processor, so you probably need to be near that.

Also: GeForce 275GTX (loaded 50-60%)

Settings:

JITIT experimental recompiler

HLE DSP (use Xaudio2 if you get audio lag, but don't use surround sound)

Vsync off (too much CPU usage)

OpenMP texture decoding

Dual Core (speedup)

**AND YES I PREORDERED MONADO ON AMAZON**

bugs: If a cutscene has a flashback, the audio is jittery until the cutscene ends.  That is the only one I have come across.

If audio becomes choppy in general, your CPU isn't keeping up.  Use the FPS counter, if it goes below 25, your CPU's not keeping up.

1314045205.0,25,self.JRPG,jqxyk,An old JRPG fan's (spoiler-free) thoughts after a few hours of Xenoblade.,26,1,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/jqxyk/an_old_jrpg_fans_spoilerfree_thoughts_after_a_few/,"First off, I'm a huge fan of Xenogears.  I rank it among my three favorite games, along with FFVIII and Chrono Trigger.  Really good JRPGs were few and far between even in their heyday, and even moreso now that they've fallen out of fashion.  As such, it's notable that at this point (after maybe five hours of gameplay), I'm still hopeful that Xenoblade will take its place among my favorite JRPGs.  Whether it does or not depends, at this point, largely on the story, which is what I would consider to be the main selling point of these sorts of games.

First off, I'm sure everyone who is interested enough to read this has seen the screen shots.  The screens are nothing to write home about; in fact, it's safe to say that the character graphics are significantly less detailed than most PS2-era games (specifically, they're a step or two down from Xenosaga, which is interesting since Xenosaga and Xenoblade share the same spiritual predecessor).  To put it succinctly, the graphics look like they came from 10 years ago, back when JRPGs were actually good.  This is something I'm willing to accept in order to have the type of vast, open world in JRPGs that hasn't been available on the PS3 due to cost constraints (ie, why FFXIII feels like running through a bunch of really pretty hallways).

I've got high expectations for the plot, thus far.  I promised spoiler-free thoughts, so I won't get into specifics, but the setting suggests the possibility of a very interesting history.  It's written and directed by the same guy who wrote Xenogears, so I have high hopes.  The game world clearly has a history (although not a lot of it has been revealed at this point), and the character conversations thus far foreshadow the possibility that the bad guys may be more complicated than they initially appear.

The music is beautiful, intense, and epic.  It really takes me back.

The game system itself is quite solid.  It's the first JRPG (in my opinion) to *successfully* make use of the last decade's MMO-inspired RPG mechanics.  Monster killing and item collection quests are quick and smooth enough that for once I don't find them annoying.  Travel to visited locations is instantaneous, and when quests are finished, you receive the reward right then instead of having to report back to the person who gave you the quest.

In combat, Xenoblade uses the idea of aggro, which will be familiar to most MMORPG players.  This is something that the game does well, even though Xenoblade is single-player.  Playing as a damage-dealing character, I have to consider how much damage I do and work that into my strategy, but I don't feel like the ""tank"" character is incompetent.  You can also switch lead characters, which I haven't really tried yet.  The various combat moves have fairly long cooldowns, and most of them work the best from a certain angle around the creature(s) you're fighting.  Hence, you find yourself maneuvering to the back or the side of the monster depending on what moves are currently available to you, which keeps combat feeling interesting and varied despite the fact that the system isn't bogged down with the complexity that can sometimes plague JRPGs.

Some equipment has gem slots, and you can make gems yourself, out of ether crystals dropped by the monsters you fight.  There's clearly some nuance to this process that I don't understand just yet.  Some of the item drops indicate that there may be other sorts of crafting available in the game, but don't hold me to that.

Finally, one minor quibble.  In the first area of the game, the best armor for female characters is a bikini.  It's not like a chainmail bikini or anything, and I openly admit that I quite enjoy fanservice.  The fact that the armor is a bikini doesn't offend my morals; rather, it offends my sense of logic that someone would be running around fighting monsters in actual swimwear.  Rikku in FFX-2 has an equally revealing outfit that's not *actually a bathing suit*, and it works just fine.  Even a bikini top with long pants or a skirt or something would have been fine.  It's just silly that the bikini is the best girl armor in the starting area.  For the record, this doesn't ruin the game for me, and it's very promising that this is the only thing I have to rant about.

All in all, it's a great start to what will hopefully be an amazing game.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed. :)",,False,,t5_2quw1,False,,flan,True,t3_jqxyk,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/jqxyk/an_old_jrpg_fans_spoilerfree_thoughts_after_a_few/,

I am sure that newer games I'm not aware of have a lot more of this since those are the times we live in, but it's a topic that randomly came to my head.

I started playing JRPGs when I was pretty young. I was about six and started with the first SNES RPGs that came out and continued playing RPGs obsessively until I was about 15. I was always sort of pervy, though, so even when I was 8-years-old I was always ""reading into things"" in the perviest way possible. In retrospect I'm wondering how much of this type of stuff was actually in the old games, though. 

I remember the Don Corneo scene in FFVII being very memorable for how sleazy it was and it was a sign that the RPG market was changing. In games before that I know there would be some ""hubba hubba"" dialogue, creepy old men, and some very subtle implications with romantic exchanges, but this was... new.

The game is entirely filled with jRPG tropes, however uses a number of smart gameplay mechanisms to keep it fresh. Here are a few that come to mind.

**The Floating Continents**
Floating continents are hardly a new idea for JRPGs. Moreover the floating island has been a motif in popular culture as well. In Final Fantasy VI the big key event in the game happens on a floating continent. I'd also argue that the *key* events in Chrono Trigger (a game also brilliantly riddled with tropes) take place in the kingdom of Zeal, a series of floating islands. Perhaps Baiten Kaitos's world is even a touch similar to Skies of Arcadia, because air boats. 

**Town Exploration**
Like FFVI and many other games, items can be found throughout towns in the nooks and crannies of stranger's homes. 

**Battles**
The battle system in Baiten Kaitos is awesome. Enemies are met on the map, and the battles are card based. I enjoyed the duality of [magnus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baiten_Kaitos#Magnus) as an item and a usable attack in battle. This is why I didn't like the sequel so much, they replaced the many awesome varying attack cards for different characters with cards that just say 'attack.' Using combos in battle is tons of fun, and luck definitely plays an ample role in the battle system. 

**Leveling**
Unlike the majority of JRPGs, leveling is done in one specific location. At certain save points one is able to go to the church. At the church you can 'level up' or 'class up.' Leveling up is dependent of experience gained in battle. Leveling up increases the health and strength of your characters. An upgrade in class results in an increase in deck size, and consequently the size of combos performable in battle. Your level can be increased by simple grinding, but your class is improved by items gained at certain points in the storyline. Because of this, battles are generally kept fun and strategic, while boss battles can have a reasonable amount of challenge to them even if you have trained. 

  It just really seems like they made it work with Baiten Kaitos. It has the perfect balance of old and new. Come to think of it, Baiten Kaitos has quenched my RPG thirst more than almost anything in a number of years.

Discuss.

1364413800.0,22,self.JRPG,1b4oeo,Growing Up and Changing the Way You Play,27,5,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1b4oeo/growing_up_and_changing_the_way_you_play/,"Hello, fellow JRPGers. I hope you don't mind if I share something that I've been thinking and trying to do lately.

A little background on me:
I am in my mid 20s with a wife and kids, and besides my family, JRPGs are my love. In fact, I recently got back in to full time so I could become a Programmer/Game Developer(Programmer for main job and game developer as a hobby/side job. Gotta keep the kids fed) and hope to create an awesome RPG some day.

When I was 4 in 1992, my brother and I rented a little game called Final Fantasy II(IV), and from that time on I've been in love with RPGs and even learned how to read because of them.

In my teenage years, all my extracurricular activities were playing games. During these years I would play through and grind through an RPG until I could do everything there was to do to and didn't care how long it took to do it. I would also achieve the end of a game by over powering my main character, since after the first couple of dungeons/bosses and forcing  you to learn the mechanics of the games, there was a point where you could start really buffing up your main guy and just dominate. I've also always hated Magic, since it just didn't seem effective to watch an ultimate spell take 3 minutes to show its animation to do 9999 damage once when my main dude can inflict 9999 multi hits in like 20 seconds.

Having a wife and kids and going to school full time can really change that. I've recently been going through games I've grown up playing and trying to play them again which has proven to be surprisingly difficult because I just don't feel I have the gusto to go and find all the best stuff for my character which has led me to a little experiment: play the game how it was suppose to be played.  I have also loved the stories of RPGs and how they pull me in, so playing it in a linear way has really helped me stay focus on the story.

For the first game in this experiment I have chosen FFX. I will not be obsessing over stuff that I miss and obsessing over grinding to make Tidus unstoppable. I will play the game how it is given to me, and try my hardest to develop strategies to advance. 6 hours in, I can already feel a huge change in how I'm seeing the game being played(I am even using MAGIC!!!!). The sense of wonder I first felt playing the game has come back...and I feel happy playing again rather than frustrated.([Side note: I've also been live broadcasting this experience](http://twitch.tv/enkerblues).) It feels like I'm playing the game for the first time again.

I am glad I decided to not continue playing games into the next gen consoles that are all about achievements and DLC. I made the choice to basically only play games when I felt games were good and not force myself to like games that only encourage to unlock achievements and such. I've been an old school snob and only play games from PS2 or before.

I challenge others to take this approach if you feel you've grown out of some games, or find yourself frustrated that it isn't the same magic you remember from days long ago. **The game hasn't changed, and neither has the sense of amazement...you've changed, and the way you play the game can change too.**

Let me know if you've had a similar experience or things you'd like to add!

(Will probably edit this post to add/take away things since I feel like I just ranted too much.)

**TL;DR**: As you grow up and play games you used to play when you were little, try playing the games the way they were meant to be played. Enjoy them.

First, I have to just say, this game was incredible. Hands down, it is worth a play through.

I'm playing through the series 1 at a time, so this was my second game. Again, just like the first one, aesthetically the game was kickass. You raise an army, make friends and enemies along the way, and had a pretty tight battle system.



Spoilers ahead


I have to admit though, there was something about Suikoden I's story that really grabbed me a bit more. The battle against your father, to me, was a bit cooler than running into your best friend now and then who was the enemy. 

HOWEVER, I do have to say, when you are on the mission to kill Luca, I was literally mashing buttons and following him around the screens with rage. His characterization is so brutal and so well done. 

When Nanami ""dies,"" I literally was shocked like when Aeris does. But I almost think it was worse. Nanami was in my party's lineup for 90% of the game, then BAM. And then the game moves on so fast, they barely mention her again. I was so pissed at the enemy the whole time.


Any words of advice for the III, which I'll play next?

I finished the game about 4-5 weeks back and I want to know what you guys think of it.
I'll go first: 

Story: Not for everyone, the game makes you search for bits and pieces of the story by yourself, forcing you to immerse yourself in the world, which I found to be bloody brilliant. All the NPC's had their own identity and they felt extremely alive. The character interactions was also done extremely well IMO.

Gameplay: Its shit tough to figure it out, but once you do, I've never had this much fun with a battle system in a long time. IMO it took Valkyrie chronicles and fixed it up pretty damn good (theres no cheap way of winning you have to know how use the environment and character placing)

Setting: the steam punk feel it was going for was perfect imo, Just walking around towns and seeing gears constantly turning, lets you realize that this is a living breathing world.

Music: No complaints whatsoever, the final battle theme was badass

8.5/10 imo

As I was growing up, the FF series left a pretty large impact on my life, it literally affected who I was, and who I wanted to me. I'm sure other people here on the subreddit are no different.

The FF series (for me, up to FFXI) got everything right. Over and over squaresoft/enix could make a magical world, characters, a story and a timeless soundtrack. I would just get lost in all of it.
I've noticed now that I'm older, I don't really spend more time than I need to in games. I appreciate all the graphics, but so many games lack a certain charm. It makes me think about how many great games there were on the PS3... but why were none of them my favourites? There were huge games with original stories, content and music... Still I find myself wanting to go back to the old FF games.

I think now, the reason I continue to play RPGs is to rekindle that flame I had a few years ago. I keep looking for something to get lost in, but nothing past the PS2 era really made me fall in love with a game.
I will say, though, when FFXIII came out, it was pretty much universally panned, I felt like a niche crowd enjoyed it (probably rightfully so), but I played it obsessively. That was the last time I came close to that 'FF feeling'. The only reason it failed to me was because at the end of the game... there wasn't really a world to keep exploring, it was simply a list of missions. It was just a very long corridor. I still enjoyed what I could though.

I'm still looking for a special game to lose myself in. A crazy story with good characters, a world to explore (that isn't endless and empty, but full and abundant). A game with a certain charm that makes me want to do everything and then some. And honestly, I'm scared that I might not find it, maybe I'm just trapped in best time of my life and can't move on, or maybe nothing has simply raised the bar from the quality of games back then.

1364263770.0,22,self.JRPG,1b0l9d,What would your ideal 'Frankenstein JRPG' made up of mechanics from other games include? I'll start with a few ideas.,27,5,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1b0l9d/what_would_your_ideal_frankenstein_jrpg_made_up/,"**'Rows' from Final Fantasy**

This is an interesting idea because it makes your party formation, and therefore planning, more important.  Since FFII, characters could be sorted into front or back rows, which would be represented visually on the battlefield.  The characters in back receive less damage, but in exchange inflict less damage with short range weapons (or in FFII's case, are only able to inflict damage with bows or magic).

It's very rudimentary and kind of black and white, but I think it could be adapted into a slightly more realistic 'Range vs. Row' type of mechanic, which would give melee weapons with more range (spears, flails, what-have-you) a slight advantage and deepen strategy somewhat.

**Enemy groupings from Dragon Quest**

In Dragon Quest games, weapons and skills are distinguished by their pattern of attack; either they hit a single enemy, a 'group' of enemies, or all enemies.

However, it's always been somewhat limited.  The enemies are always lined up in a row like a choir, which can make the groupings seem somewhat arbitrary, particularly because only like enemies can be grouped together.  If the enemy groups and attack patterns were represented visually on the battlefield, it might lead to a more immersive experience, especially when range comes into play.

**Visible resistances from Paper Mario**

One of the most interesting things I've ever experienced in any RPG was how in Paper Mario, a game with strong, bright, straight-forward visuals, you had to rely on your observation and knowledge of the game's mechanics to plan your attack.  For instance, flying enemies needed to be hit with a ranged or 'Jump' attack; conversely, enemies with spiked or flaming heads could not be hit with Jump attacks. 

This is a deceptively simple way to make choosing attacks more fun.  To some extent, this concept is present in other RPGs, but they rely on the player to be well-learned; for instance, if you're assailed by zombies, you'd need at least some prior knowledge to know the things undead enemies are typically weak against and whether or not the game you're playing breaks the mold in any way.  The idea of relying on observation and knowledge to determine an enemy's weak point means your game is automatically more visually interesting and eliminates a bit of trial and error, but on the other hand, may make it too easy. 


**Thanks for reading, and don't hesitate to post new/hybrid mechanical ideas too, if you've got something truly revolutionary!  And remember, they needn't be combat mechanics; story progression, character progression, ability acquisition, everything's on the table.**

It's a broken record you're tired of hearing, but there's a reason it's still playing. The fact is the last JRPG to *really* take the world by storm was Kingdom Hearts and nothing has ever lived up to the impact of Final Fantasy VII. I'm not saying there haven't been any great games to come out in the past few years. The DS was home to plenty of great games like The World Ends With You and Radiant Historia, both of which have become some of my favorites of all time. I even loved FFXIII, despite understanding all the hate it gets. 

Xenoblade and The Last Story are both great examples of how the genre can improve and evolve, but the fact that the battle to release them in the west was akin to thermonuclear war and that they were both released in such limited capacities with little marketing says a lot of their respective publishers confidence (financial reasons aside). Were they released during the genre's prime (PSX/early PS2 era) they would likely have been mega-hits. What happened? 

You could make the argument that they didn't hit it out of the park financially because they were released for the Wii, which has never been a good way to succeed for third parties, but Ni No Kuni is being released soon for PS3, and I'd bet four out of five people at your local Gamestop haven't heard of it.

When did we become a niche genre? Why is the East so averse to innovating? What happened to the Squaresoft I grew up with? I know there are exceptions to everything I'm saying here but almost none of them are anything close to notable.

* **Guardian's Crusade (PSX)** - One of my childhood favorites. A very cute, traditional, cartoony, ""beginners"" RPG. Despite it being easy, it was super addictive.

I was worried that I might not like it, seeing as I couldn't get into the combat system of Devil Survivor. I understand it's difficult on purpose, but I feel like the difficulty is not the fun sort of difficulty. I think the game is really cheap on these points:

- Recruitment seems completely arbitrary. The same responses don't work for different instances of the same demon. I feel like I'm just flipping coins most of the time.

- Enemy attacking schemes are tossups between fairly ineffectual attacks and total OHKOs. If it's the enemy's turn, I just sit there hoping he doesn't (as far as I can tell, arbitrarily) use an attack that will kill one of my demons and give him a whole extra turn.

I just don't like how randomly cheap it feels. I never feel like I've died fairly. If I accidentally don't get the pre-emptive strike and get pre-empted upon myself, I just sit there hoping nothing goes wrong, and that's just not fun.

I didn't see any topic addressing this event specifically so I thought it would be useful to have one place to discuss it.  I know that WKC's popularity plummeted precipitously (dat alliteration) but as someone who played it as soon as I could get it (Feb 3, 2010) I will definitely miss logging on during a rainy weekend and grinding out some quests with random people and a few good friends.

To me WKC is a classic case of over-promising and under-delivering both in terms of game features and online capabilities.  Despite all that Level-5 managed to make a weird, flawed but charming game that caused me to squander several hundred hours fighting dragons, ogres, and chimeras to improve my characters and gain as much grade as I could both online and off.  For that I am truly grateful and perhaps if I get the itch I'll check out the Japanese servers eventually (but probably not).

Does anyone else have fond memories of WKC online?  What games will you move to now? FF14? GW2? PSO2?

I picked up Fire Emblem: Awakening and really enjoy it. I love the SRPG style of battle that these games offer. The whole planning aspect like a chess match. I see the game is getting rave reviews (9's &amp; 4.5s) everywhere. The presentation, gameplay system, story, content, value and DLC are great but there is one aspect that I see as a rather big flaw and diminishes the game for me personally.


I have not played it too heavily but from my experience on Hard, as well as reading others comments, the AI seems not too bright. Moving the difficulty to Lunatic/Lunatic+ doesn't change how the CPU moves their men or their logic it just adds more stats and skills to their men.

The CPU doesn't play as another commander would. They don't gang up on you, they don't play defense, and they are careless if they lose a man. I feel sort of cheap using all the techniques at my disposal that the AI never uses such as the attack range overlay to place men out of their attack range, drawing them in to attack me with a poor weapon matchup, and using the support system/pair up. It feels less that I am solving the puzzle like chess does and more 'gamey' like I am just exploiting the AIs logic.

I have not played a huge number of SRPGs prior but I plan to because I do enjoy the combat system and it offers something unique over the turn-based final fantasy gameplay.

So my question is this: What SRPGs have the most challenging AI without resorting to making the difficulty harder by stacking the CPU units with bigger stats/skills?",,False,,t5_2quw1,False,,,True,t3_1891if,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1891if/which_srpgs_have_the_most_challengingdynamic_ai/,

1345662429.0,22,self.JRPG,ynhql,Suikoden III - Thoughts After Replaying 10 Years Later (A Review of Sorts),27,5,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/ynhql/suikoden_iii_thoughts_after_replaying_10_years/,"My relationship with the Suikoden series feels like a giant game of tug-of-war. Suikoden III was my introduction into the series. I remember sitting in one of my blow off classes in high school for months looking at screens and reading up on previews and what not (RPGamer got me through that class). I remember picking the game up the second it came out, too. Without going too deep into it, I fell in love with the series immediately. I finished the game, got Suikoden II for Christmas 2002, and bought the first one a few weeks later. Suikoden I-III have to be my favorite trilogy of games in my collection. I could go on forever about how IV broke my heart in disappointment and how I never finished V after finding out 20 hours in that you can miss Stars of Destiny arbitrarily, but this is about Suikoden III. 

Now, 10 years later I decided to go back and play the game that began my love affair with just over half this seemingly forgotten franchise. I have been giving Suikoden III blanket recommendations for nearly a decade now, but I really wanted to see if my opinion has changed being 26 instead of 16. Here are my thoughts playing this unique game 10 years later. My number system isn't really based on anything, I am just providing a generic number to represent my overall opinion.

Gameplay - The lifeblood of a game is in its gameplay, and I can't say that Suikoden III has really aged well. In fact, I'd say it failed even back then, but I was too enamored with it to not give it a pass. The overworld map is extremely simple and pretty linear. There are no dungeons to speak of, the longest ones being three or four screens of linear corridor. The monsters are, on the whole, uninspired, boring and uninteresting. It doesn't help that the battle system is the most clunky, poorly executed thing I've ever played. Don't get me wrong, I applaud Konami for trying something new (as far as I know I, II, IV, V and Treikreis use the same tried and true system (with slight variations) and in theory the system in III would be great. The only positive aspect I can point to is the skill point system, which I thought helped flesh out the characters more and add a fun dimension to character growth and setting roles for them. I used to be able to defend the battle system as a ""love it or hate it"" thing in lieu of the great plot. Now I just see it as downright awful. 
GRADE = 4/10

Plot and Characters - The cast of playable characters is where the entire Suikoden series shines, and where Suikoden III makes up for a lot of its flaws in my book. Without getting into spoilers, Suikoden I-III each have a tremendous cast of characters, and the best part is seeing the best of them come back and grow. It creates a great inter-connectivity and makes the antagonist in III much more compelling. If at all possible, play them in order, collecting all 108 Stars to benefit the most from the narratives, especially III's extended epilogue. I still don't understand how the majority of 108 Stars from three games are more compelling than nearly all the 40 in Chrono Cross (all of them in the case of FF VIII in my opinion). The innovative Trinity Sight System wins my vote as the best JRPG story-telling mechanic, hands down. I love unreliable narrators and seeing scenes from different perspectives, altering your responses to character's decisions and your emotional reactions to them throughout the adventure. I also dislike silent protagonists, and although it worked fine in II because Jowy was such a fleshed out character and, by extension, Riou the main character, I still prefer regular, scripted main characters like in III. Despite all of this, I actually found the antagonist's (not naming him for sake of spoilers) mission to be extremely generic and hard to follow in logical terms. I didn't feel compelled by his problem, and the game [degrades from a pretty fun political thriller to just your standard angry, evil mage that wants to destroy God for no compelling reason.] (/spoiler) (SORT OF ENDING SPOILER) I guess I wasn't inundated with this plot cliche 10 years ago; now it just makes me roll my eyes from its lack of creativity. I added a full point for the character of Chris because she is my absolute favorite female protagonist in JRPGs. She is strong, self-assured but grows into her confidence and, most importantly, not hyper-sexualized to the point of embarrassment.  
GRADE = 7/10

Presentation - I still enjoy Suikoden III's artwork and design decisions. By today's standards the character models are wooden and blocky, but I still like them in a nostalgic way. I'd take sprites any day of the week, and maybe it is nostalgia only, but I still love the way the character's faces change and react. I feel like the addition of voice acting has ruined JRPG plots, since there is noticeably less dialogue between characters because it is more expensive and more difficult then just typing out text. Suikoden III has plenty of interaction between all the characters, and I'm sure trying to voice 108 Stars has hindered the franchise's return to a sixth installment. 'Transcending Love' is the greatest opening cinematic since Chrono Cross, but after that the music (as most critics pointed out upon its release) was lackluster save a few select pieces. And why on earth did they think removing it during most dialogue scenes was a good idea? This issue irked me 10 years ago and it sure irks me now. GRADE = 6/10

TLDR: My opinion and perception of Suikoden III has changed pretty drastically. The characters are just as loveable, even the antagonist despite his dumb motivations. The Trinity Sight System should be a model to improve on for future RPGs since it is such a great method of story-telling. However, gameplay was downright disappointing. Give Konami credit for taking a chance, but that battle system is horrendous. For every great element of the game there is a crippling flaw that hinders it, and, while I used to give III (in connection with I and II) recommendations without reservation I can't say the game has lived up nearly as well as my initial impressions a decade ago. I'd say the series peaked at II and III was a nice conclusion to several characters before the series took a nose dive in IV. OVERALL GRADE = 6.5/10 Playable and enjoyable for fans but hardly exemplary. 

What are your thoughts, fellow Suikoden fans?

Wall of text:

I decided to start playing some JRPGs again -- but I was having a hard time choosing which one to play because I was afraid of playing a game ""wrong"" and making some fatal error that would cause me to miss a character or item that I would really have wanted.

However, I ended up playing Chrono Trigger 100% guideless other than distant memories I had from reading a strategy guide years ago. I was blissfully playing through it using a party exclusively of Chrono[/Magus](/spoiler), Frog, and Robo until I got to the Ozzie/Slash/Flea fight.  After taking a while to figure out how to beat them (I was focusing Ozzie for the first 10 minutes, lol), I was relieved -- but then had the disturbing thought: ""Why didn't I get some super treasure? Didn't they make such a big deal about a ""Flea Vest"", ""Slasher"", and ""Ozzie Pants""?""  Then it hit me, I was supposed to steal those items with that party member I hardly used with a skill I had yet to use in the game.  I was so distraught that I just turned off my game, knowing that my last save was a quite a while back.  I managed to get through it again (rather quickly), but it still really shook me.

Then, after I finished Chrono Trigger, I started the next game I decided on, FF9.  Now that you know I have mixed feelings about stealing, imagine my discomfort that the main character whom I always have in my party has the ability to steal from all the juicy enemies and bosses I encounter, taunting me with their flashy equipment.  Regardless, I kept playing through the game, but making sure to steal all the good items (it took me a while to realize the pattern that random encounters never have unique items to steal, so I only really had to worry about stealing from bosses).

After a couple bosses, I made a sudden realization:  *trying to steal items was directly extending the duration of the boss fight*.  Now, some other gamers may just think ""that's lame"", but we JRPGer's have an appreciation for long boss battles -- an aspect of the game that is often diminished due to overleveling in order to get through dungeons with minimal use of finite MP or items.  However, that dreaded mechanic, *stealing*, was letting me get more enjoyment out of boss battles since I had to keep everyone alive while the monkey tries to get the banana from the boss.

So what do you think?  Is the stress of *MAYBE* missing a *POTENTIALLY* useful item too annoying? (especially in a game like FF9 where all your abilities come from items, and some items require other items for synthesis) Also, what's another way that developers have crafted longer/more enjoyable boss battles that  you've noticed?

I will also take this into consideration for the next game I play :)

EDIT: oh gosh, the grammar nazi in me wants to let you know it should have been ""yea"" in the title.

For me, it would absolutely be [Star Ocean: The Second Story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Ocean:_The_Second_Story), because holy crap the overwhelming amount of stuff to do in that game would be the best bang for your buck. 

From the two storylines, TONS of recruitable characters, item creation, relationships, side quests, the tough-as-hell hidden dungeon, and difficulty levels, I would absolutely sink another 400 hours into that game and love every second of it.

Hell, they even left in a little bug to give you one of the best swords near the beginning of the game so replaying it is significantly less painful.

We all get older and our values in life change. After playing through Mother 3 a few years ago, it dawned on me that nearly all other jRPGs aren't worth playing. Nothing could compare to the experience I had with this beautiful game. It skyrocketed my standards to unbelievable levels. I lost my patience fiddling around with this genre as it didn't offer anything meaningful anymore. Same rehashed stories, random encounters, non-engaging battle systems, and cliche characters. No love, no unique substance to the story. Thing is, I really want to love this genre, I really do. But I just can't settle for mediocrity anymore. Maybe if I was able to live forever, I'd be willing to do so.

Besides the nostalgic value of Pokemon G/S/C, the only other jRPG besides Mother 3 I truly enjoyed was The World Ends With You. To a lesser extent, I appreciated Chrono Trigger and FFXIII, as well as Earthbound, which wonderfully introduced me to the world of Mother.

I've tried Radiant Historia, FFVI/VII/X, Golden Sun, Super Mario RPG/TTYD, Terranigma, DQIX, FF Tactics, and many more. Didn't capture me. They varied on how fun they were, but remained decent at best. A chore to play most of the time. The only thing that often kept me going were the design and music, which I'll always appreciate no matter how bad the game is in my eyes. Persona doesn't appeal too much because there's the whole ""social sim"" aspect. For the games that I haven't played (Chrono Cross, Valkyrie Profile, Suidoken II, Xenogears (+blade), Skies of Arcadia, Vagrant Story)... well I don't know, but the videos of the gameplay don't really make me want to play them that much. Just assuming there.

**So, what jRPGs do you consider to be transcendental? What appeal do you personally see in jRPGs in the present moment? What is your motivation for playing them? Let's talk about this!**",,False,,t5_2quw1,True,,,True,t3_m3elf,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/m3elf/to_everyone_on_this_subreddit_a_meditation_on_the/,

I'd like to start out with saying that Ching and I have in the past discussed and agreed upon allowing content from smaller sites to be submitted here by their authors.

However, there exists a fine line between what constitutes helpful content and what constitutes spam. For a long time, these sites and others were only submitting once every few days, and only quality content that the community as a whole would be interested in. I've felt like for at least a year now, damn near every link submitted to r/jrpg has been worth reading.

That has changed recently. We have seen an influx of posts of less and less importance, and we have started cleaning up those that are not adding much value to the sub. We haven't taken a stance of banning... *yet*. But we ask that, if you are submitting content from your own website, please curate the content. If the pattern of multiple submissions per day of lackluster content continues, sites will be removed. It is an unfortunate but necessary action, so we ask that you work with us to make this place the best it can be. Remember, reddit is not a free advertising platform.

Which brings us to our next issue: if you have an issue with a submission or post, *report it to the mods*. We had a situation today in which a user got a bit out of line in responding to what he believed to be a spammer. He has been warned, but I'd like to make it clear that, in the future, any posting of personal information or otherwise acting childish or confrontational on this sub will result in an immediate ban. I created this place to have friendly, civil conversation about jrpgs—which is damn near impossible elsewhere on reddit and the internet as a whole—and I'd like to keep it that way. If you see name calling or other attacks, please click the report button and we will look into the issue; don't respond and feed the trolls. 

As always, we welcome discussion on any and all of these issues and value your feedback. ",,False,,t5_2quw1,True,,delita,True,t3_kzxmo,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/kzxmo/rjrpg_moderation_update/,moderator

Two years later, going to English classes mostly meant I'd spend the entire hour playing with my phone or reading books, because the teacher forbade me from participating in class.

I was wondering if I could repeat the same thing to teach myself enough Japanese to breeze through my massive backlog of jRPGs in their original language instead of relying on fan translations.

Obviously, English was easier to learn; it's very similar to my first language in certain aspects and if I didn't know a word, I usually could deduce what it meant based on similar words I knew, from either language.

Japanese, however, uses a completely different writing system and most of the words don't have a common heritage with English. Thus, my question: how would I go about getting a big enough vocabulary to let me breeze through some jRPGs with relative ease and minimal googling?

I didn't do any of the side quests or talked to the NPC. I did watch all the cut scenes and read all the main quest line dialogue.

But while playing the game I felt like I did not connect to the characters like I felt the game was trying to assume I was, [Weiss when he was being taken over by Noir, and couple of Emil scenes. Also I felt like I was taking crazy pills about what happened when Popola and Devona didn't let Emil and Kaine stay in town.](/spoiler) And I was wondering skipping these side quests did I miss out on any character development or was it just the story telling in Nier. 

Not that all the story telling was bad, in the end I ended up liking the game.

Last week I finally made an account and subscribed to the awesome subreddits(including this one).  I've also not been here long enough to have been in on the discussions when they happened originally.

So in trying to get to know r/JRPGs lurkers, this is the best question I could think of.  I'm sick of the constant fights over Kefka v Sephiroth... Rinoa v Tifa... why does FF8/10/11/12/13 suck so hard.

Ar tonelico holds a soft spot for me.  The music is amazing, the gameplay is fun.  It wasn't ground-breaking or anything, but  it kept me interested, unlike a large number of turn-based JRPG's that I have to play in spurts.  I'm in love with the overall storyline.  And those beautiful backgrounds in in AT1/2 that lagged my slim PS2 to no end =/.

And I actually enjoy alot of the fan service.  Most of the time it is alongside something that made me lol at the time.

And the most important part of the puzzle... JACQLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII/[MIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!](/spoiler)

Being a massive FF fan, I feel a bit silly now having never played VI and now finally realising why it is better than VII or even IX (IMO, dont hate).

But yeah, other than this game being absolutely incredible (better even than CT? Maybe), I am STUCK and getting solidly raped at this part.

I am at the part where I have to make 3 teams of 2 and fight Kefka (who is an AMAZING antogonist. He crazy!), and he is sending his troops up the mountain and you have to fight them all with your different teams.

Well, OK, did that. Then there is a ""sub-boss"" before Kefka (you appear to be able to skip him if you move past him fast).

Either way, both the sub-boss and Kefka seem fucking impossible. Kefka (the twat) is doing nearly 400 damage with a single hit and insta-KOing everyone I have left.

There must be some trick to this I have missed because its been easy up till now and I have even got some grinding in before hand. What am I doing wrong?

Thanks guys. This game fucking owns.

Sure, the JRPG genre didn't have many big, worldchanging innovations in the last few years, but so did other genres.

What innovations did you see in FPSs? Fighting games? MMORPGs? Hell World of warcraft is the most popular MMORPG by far, and it's the least innovative and most iterative title i saw in several years.

Yet people love those games and almost no one complains that they don't innovate. 
JRPGs? The first piece of criticism you'll hear is that they don't ""innovate"" (alongside other silly stuff like emo characters and spiky hair).

And it pisses me off, because it almost seems like the ""lack of innovation"" is being used as the easiest excuse to bash the genre, while it's rather inconsequential. If a game is fun, moving, has good characters and a good story, who cares about innovation? I play to have fun, not to marvel at how clever the developer has been. 

Don't get me wrong. I welcome innovation when it comes, but I don't think it should be a *primary* objective for developers, not only in this genre.

1300877366.0,21,self.JRPG,g9m7n,"JRPG fans, please tell me why you thought Final Fantasy VIII was so bad?",25,4,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/g9m7n/jrpg_fans_please_tell_me_why_you_thought_final/,"So I was reading some forum, about people's top 10 JRPG's of all time. MANY people put FF7, FF6, FF5, FF4, FF9, even FF10 &amp; 12, and people agree/aren't bothered. Then one person puts FF8 in their list and a ton of people start quoting and saying things like 'I died a little inside when I saw FF8 on your list' and 'No list deserves that game on there'

My question is, **why** do people think it was a bad game? I've tried searching around, reading reviews. The most I've managed to find out is that people complain about the draw system and how 'long' it takes to draw magic. If you're going to draw-spam, junction your highest stat to Magic, to draw 9 at a time, or better yet, just don't think about magic until you have Ragnarok, then go to the Island of Heaven/Hell &amp; draw-spam the best magic in the game from the hidden draw points there. It's not like magic is necessarily needed until Ultimecia's Castle anyway.

The other complaint I've found is people highly reliant on GF's only, Shiva/Ifrit spamming their way through the game, and getting tired of seeing the animation they do and having to spam the square button to increase the damage. My only answer to this is: Don't use GF's then? You don't need them. Squall &amp; some others are completely capable of doing more damage in less amounts of time. Keep on relatively low health for Renzokuken spam and have the others heal/revive if he loses too much health/dies.

In regards to the story, some say it falls off the rails, it's too ridiculous, unrealistic, stupid events happen, etc. I've played most FF games, including 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 1 &amp; 2 (going for 6 next), and I honestly think in terms of story, 8 beats all of them. It takes a while to kick off the main story, but as soon as you get that far everything seems to start to make you think 'What the HELL is going on?!' only to have the story cluster together to form a huge mind-fuck.

It just seems to me, from the reviews, that the people who tried FFVIII just didn't really understand it properly. There's a couple of things to get your head around (e.g where to get the best magic, how to draw more amounts, junctioning GF's and making them learn the best abilities, where to get the best weapons, etc) but after learning the game's mechanics it feels like it really pays off with the understanding.

So I just have to ask, for the people that dislike FF8, what's your reason? I wouldn't go as far as to say I'm an 8 fanboy. I've probably finished 9 &amp; 10 more times than I have with 8, I'm just curious to know why it's so hated and shot down?",,False,,t5_2quw1,False,,,True,t3_g9m7n,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/g9m7n/jrpg_fans_please_tell_me_why_you_thought_final/,

I made this realization once before, a year or so ago and at that time decided to just play more organically. Stop worrying about playing all these RPGs and just do what I want to do. If I really WANT to play a game it is going to happen. And I ended up eventually making my way back to Tales of Graces f and really enjoying myself for a while.

I think as I have grown older my interests have changed and I just have to embrace that, I get much more fulfillment from reading these days than playing games.

Since quitting about two years ago I've been catching up through my massive backlog by emulating through the PS2 generation.  My question now is whether or not to buy a PS3 and get into the current gen games or to wait for the PS4.  I saw that the PS4 won't natively be backwards compatible, but Sony has hinted that down the line they will add streaming emulated PS3 software to the PS4. (Who knows when that will realistically happen.) I'm also kind of torn because there is no way in seven hells I'm not going to play Persona 5 on launch day, which I know is still far off but most likely will be a PS4 title. (Unless they opt for the 3DS which is possible, but less likely.) So basically I expect I'm going to buy a PS4 eventually as well.

**tldr; Think it's still worth getting a PS3, or better to wait for the PS4?**

Some games that I'll probably pick up from this generation are:

* Catharine
* FFXIII -2 -3, (I know it gets a good bit of hate, but IMO there are a good deal of vocal e-whiners out there and I'd rather see for myself)
* Valkyria Chronicles
* Tales of Graces F
* Tales of Xillia (launch is soonish?)
* Nier
* Ni no Kuni

* Shadow of the Colossus

* Dark Souls -2

I'll start.  

Chie from Persona 4 is the most polarizing character I've ever seen.  You either love her, or hate her.  I haven't talked to anyone about this who doesn't feel so strongly about her. I hate her. I'll explain why. 

Lets stick with the starting few, MC, Yosuke, Yukiko, and Chie.  

Each of these characters are presented in a straight-forward way.  MC is you, Yosuke is the goofy best friend, Yukiko is the quiet hot girl, and Chie is the cute strong tomboy.  

As the story develops, each character deepens their roles that they were presented as, expect Chie, who time and time again shows that she's not actually that cute, not actually that strong, and not really that tomboy-y.  It's like the game is keeps shouting 'HEY CHIE, YOU'RE REALLY STRONG AND INDEPENDENT!', and Chie as a character only reverberates 'H-ha, almost!'

I hate Chie because she's presented as something she never lives up to, and the game keeps telling me otherwise.  Similar to how annoying permadeath from a character in a cut-scene is when you're given a revive spell/item in combat.  

TL;DR - You either love or hate some characters, no in-between.  Discuss.

1357140716.0,19,self.JRPG,15tuna,I finished my Suikoden II stream and will be starting Final Fantasy Tactics tonight at 8PM EST. Info inside!,25,6,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/15tuna/i_finished_my_suikoden_ii_stream_and_will_be/,"I first just want to say thanks to Adremeaux for letting me post to /r/JRPG!

You might or might not have noticed on the sidebar my Suikoden II stream. I also posted in /r/jrpg when I began that stream. Well, I have finished that on stream and will be starting my next game, Final Fantasy Tactics! 

I'm going to give a small FAQ on some info for my plans and other related things. Let me know of any questions you have!

**How can I watch your stream?** A couple ways. [Here](http://twitch.tv/overstockretro) is a link directly to my stream. Thanks to Adremeaux, you can also find a link on the side bar as well.

How often do you stream? This answer really varies. I try to stream about 4-5 days a week but my schedule when I stream changes because of what is going on with real life. I generally stream on the weekdays around 7-8PM till 9-10PM. Weekends I generally stream in the afternoon. All are EST.

How can I know when you start streaming? To not spam /r/JRPG this will be the only post showing when I am streaming. There are multiple ways to know when I will stream:

[You can subscribe to my YouTube where I update the feed with my plans](http://youtube.com/overstockretro)

[You can like my Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/OverstockRetroStream)

[You can also make an account at twitch.tv and follow my stream. This is one of the easiest as it will give you an email when I go live and you can find me easier on the twitch website.](http://twitch.tv/overstockretro)

If you subscribe to /r/vgstreams I post each day when I will be going live with plenty of notice ahead of time.

**What kind of character classes will you use?** I haven't fully decided yet but I will probably have Ramza as some kind of utility character. He's a versatile character because he gets the benefit of male physical growth and female magic growth. I'll probably use a common monk/ninja hybrid late game. I'll probably have Mustadio as a chemist hybrid as he's pretty awesome there. I do plan on having some female casters early on with yin yang magic and black magic. I'll move onto summon/time magic later. I might use Cid. We'll see.

**Will you do the Deep Dungeon?** More than likely no as I really do not like that place. It's just a personal thing. I might show off some of the levels of it.

**What about Cloud?** I'll get Cloud and Reis and show them off. I've never really used either long term as Cloud requires a lot micro-management to make him even decent. 

**Will you be getting ultra rare and stealable equipment?** I highly doubt I'll be doing any stealing for rare gear. Why? I'm really anti grind where needed. If you watched my Suikoden II stream, you know that I detest grinding for the most part. I find stealing the ultra rare equipment wayyyyy too anti fun and what not. I will be doing a little grinding of battles at certain points as it is sorta needed.

**Why should I watch your stream?** I aim to interact with the people watching me and having a good time in stream. I am 27 so I am not a nasally 14 year old and I strive to also give my experiences and knowledge about the game into the streams. I am certainly not perfect but I really enjoy having people in chat and having a good time.

**How long do you stream?** I usually only stream for 2 hours per night. The only time I stream longer, if I do, is on the weekend when I have more time. I upload my streams to my YouTube where you can also catch up.

Anyway, I hope you'll check out my streams and come say hi and interact with me/other viewers! If you have any questions about the game or anything, I'm at work for most of the day and can answer you here.

Since a few months ago, I have been thrown into the world of JRPG. I started out with NieR, which was simply epic, and logged 75ish hours and got all trophies. Never played a SP game that much before. It was truly amazing. 

Next i played Persona 3. That blew my mind in terms of turn based RPG (last one was LOTR: The Third Age Gamecube). With no money to buy a PS2 or PS1 to play the other Persona games, i am stuck in terms of what to play next. Any JRPG suggestions for a newbie? I have a PC and a PS3. other than that, I am strapped. i know most of the good ones are in the PS1 and PS2 consoles...but any rare gems out there for my console? 

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the great suggestions! I can already tell, my wallet is going to be stretched thin in the coming months. Might just go ahead and buy a PS2, still in the thinking stage. I am trying to emulate the PS1 on my PC, I tried ePSXe, I downloaded the BIOS, but for some reason, whenever i try to run a game (Xenogears) it keeps crashing. Not sure why. Any other good emulators out there? Oh and the games I have decided to play in the Short Run are:

Tales of Graces F--
Chrono Trigger--
Final Fantasy Series--
Xenogears (then maybe xenosaga or xenoblade)--
Valkyrie Profile--
Legend of Dragoon. --

It's got some pretty memorable moments but throughout the entire adventure, everything just felt so average. Yet for some reason, I always see this game pop up as one of the best rpgs ever made.

Unlike other people, I didn't think the story was all that derivative of Final Fantasy VII. The only real similarity I saw was the blonde spiky haired hero chasing after a silver haired mad man. If there were more similar plot elements between the two, let me know. Other than that, it created a decent story but it was hindered by the atrocious voice acting (Even though it was few and far in between) and the dialogue looked like it was written by a middle schooler. 

The additions may have been fun but not being able to swap additions during battle so you have to repeat the same old attack and hear the same stupid phrase was annoying. Not only that, but the magic system was ridiculous too. Only being able to cast magic in dragoon form or through the use of items with poorly made magic visuals was a real let-down.

That is to say a you get further in the game, the colors become more vibrant, and the music becomes more complicated, and it's reflected in and explained by whatever the big bad's presence is, and with a bonus of a really out there setting that you would absolutely not expect from such a game.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciVt-Y3ptjo

I love the idea of this being the Final Version of a simple jazz theme in a Persona game set in the 20s or something. Set in the 20s, desaturated colors to make it feel like an old photo, lots of digital-synthetic jazz or something, and as the game goes further, the music becomes more complicated and the colors/scenery becomes clearer and brighter. Social links would remain in the stylized colors and become brighter as you advanced them. Kinda like Pleasantville, I guess. 

Just imagine a flapper party member. Imagine [these outfits](http://sensibility.com/vintageimages/1940s/images/40sblousewithskirt.jpg) and hairstyles in the proper art style. Imagine that they begin nearly monochrome, extremely desaturated, and as you progress in the game, month by month, more colors emerge and the end result is almost psychadelic. What looked like a white blouse was actually covered in fantastic multicolored patterns.

The protagonist would become properly colored very shortly into the game, and this would be a game mechanic, and it would be something noticed and commented on by the characters and NPCs. The music changes, too. While ambient music obviously woudln't be noticed, the in-game music characters can hear and listen to on their own time would also transform. The impending threat of the big bad would be that these changes would revert, and the world would go monochrome literally and figuratively. The feeling of beating the game and seeing the entire party and all completed social links in full and vibrant color for the first time would be amazing. Seeing your unfinished social links still lacking some of their color would be really sad and drive you to do better for them in a New Game +. Stuff like that...

This may be going to far, but I have to say I'd like to see the NPCs dance, too. Like, all the time. Idle animations would be dancing. Sitting in class listening to the teacher? Every student bobbing gently in unison to the music. Walking down the street? People standing still are swaying side to side with the music, and those walking down the street are doing so jauntily and in-time. The music gets more complicated after a boss fight, and the animations become  just a little bit more stylized. By the end of the game everyone in every location at every time is full on just breaking out in dance. The class at school doesn't just rock gently back and forth, they're outright weaving around in their chairs with their arms up a little bit, and their heads knock twice left, knock twice right, to the beat. A girl on the main street just stands with her hands together and her legs together swaying, then when the music gets more complex she sways a little more and bounces left and right twice to the beat, then at the end of the game she's doing a full dance and does a spin at musical flourishes, and she's still shy and quiet, but not afraid, and not reclusive. She's there, where she's always been, who she's always been, but now everyone who passes by will *know it.*

I would like that. I would like this to be a whole game world centered on the idea of music and visual aesthetics and them all coming together to such degrees that as everybody in the game world grows happier and more lucid, they physically react and by the end of the game what once was a little calm town of boring, quiet people is a world of unique individuals who never stop appreciating the amazing gift of emotion and passion they've been given by the protagonist and friends driving back the shadows that had locked the world in perpetual mundane-ity.

* Interesting unique world
* Pretty good plot
* Awesome battle system
* Exploration
* Many unique enemies and good reasons to kill them
* The arts system and affinity based skill link
* The difficulty curve was solid, sometimes I felt way overpowered only to find in a new area they expected me to be that level, and the bosses were still challenging.

What disappointed me:

* The dialog is downright terrible most of the time.
* Had to use Shulk too much - I know he's the main character but having to use him against mechon (for enchant) and bosses (for shield and speed) was limiting.
* Lack of party composition options - I wish you could use 4 characters instead of 3. Because when it comes to any fight that's actually difficult, you HAVE TO use Sharla, and you HAVE TO use a Tank, so Reyn or Dunban. And you HAVE TO use Shulk if it's going to be a really hard fight because of shield and speed and light heal. I fucking LOVED using Fiora, and liked Melia too, but when it came to any significant battle, I couldn't use them and that was a disappointment.
* Bad AI: If you controlled Melia she was a powerhouse, if you didn't she was worse than anyone else you could use. I don't think Reyn ever used guard shift without me telling him to. There are other examples, but basically you can't depend on any AI controlled character to do the best thing most of the time.
